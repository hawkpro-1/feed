Some of these commercial plugins began life as internal tools, built by Spotify developers, for Spotify developers. Other plugins in the bundle are brand new to the Backstage platform.

Basically, whenever a team saw a problem they could solve with a plugin, they built one. And if it solved a common problem, the plugin became more popular, improving through a virtuous cycle of user feedback and iteration. The more useful a plugin was, the more people who used it, the more feedback it got, the more useful it became, and so on. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ability for any team to build a plugin is part of what makes Backstage a two-sided marketplace: a platform for your teams to both build on and use, where solutions come from the ground up and follow an inner source model for development. From a technical perspective, it’s the plugin architecture of Backstage that enables this autonomy. Have a problem? Build a plugin! Don’t like a plugin? Open an issue or PR — and help make it better!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBuilt the way we build all our software\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe plugins in our commercial bundle represent some of our best and most used plugins, as well as new plugins built specifically for Backstage adopters. Individually, the five plugins do very different things — from promoting software quality to managing access control to matching mentors with mentees. But they all reflect a very Spotify way of doing things. That’s because they were built with the same principles underlying how we build all our software. Let’s take a closer look at some of those principles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFour Spotify principles for building effectively at scale\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the ways we like to sum up our software development philosophy at Spotify is this: “Think it, build it, ship it, tweak it.” We want our squads to ship high-quality code, fast — and keep shipping it, while improving on it with each iteration. It’s an easy approach to understand, but it becomes challenging to maintain as complexity takes hold within your engineering org. So, to help ensure our way of doing things at Spotify, we’re guided by certain organizational ideas and principles. Here are four of them:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e1. Keep squads fast by keeping them small, capable, and aligned\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTurn each of our 450+ squads into lean, mean, cross-functional machines that balance autonomy with collaboration. \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003ePrioritize individual development and mobility, because that makes our employees more capable and our business stronger. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e2. Make engineering excellence and quality an everyday practice \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eStrong engineering practices are the foundations for speed and agility. \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eThe fewer technologies we are world-class on, the faster we get.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e3. The best solutions come from the bottom up, so empower the teams doing the work \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGive our teams the power to pick the right tools for the job. \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eTry to avoid top-down mandates and instead focus on incentives that reduce fragmentation and drive alignment.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e4. Our fellow developers are our customers, so build with empathy\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDevelopers deserve as great an experience as our listeners and creators do. \u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eEnsure that the tools in the Spotify platform are the right tools for the job — and listen and adapt when they aren’t. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough these principles are well-ingrained within Spotify’s culture, we believe they also apply to a wide variety of engineering organizations, not just ours. Because even though we’ll argue all day long about Vim vs Emacs, tabs vs spaces, and whether a hot dog is a sandwich, we believe developers are fundamentally more similar to each other than they are different. They are creators. They want to build, collaborate, try new things, and have impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFive Spotify Plugins for Backstage\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can see various combinations of those principles underlying the new plugins in our bundle — both in what they do and how they work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e1. \u003ca href=\"https://backstage.spotify.com/plugins/soundcheck/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSoundcheck\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat: \u003c/strong\u003eRuns checks on your software components and displays how well they measure up to your org’s engineering standards.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy: \u003c/strong\u003eCodify and promote engineering best practices that improve quality, reliability, security, and consistency throughout your software ecosystem.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow:\u003c/strong\u003e Seeing leads to doing.

When an asset owner fixed a vulnerability, they clicked the “Resolve” button in the email to update us. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith Comet, we had the basic automation pattern covered, but we wanted to go even further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe reevaluated our vulnerability lifecycle by first defining the states that each vulnerability could be in, along with the actions required of the responsible team. It was at this stage we decided to add more states than what Comet offered. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe wanted to visualize the vulnerabilities each team was assigned on \u003ca href=\"https://backstage.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBackstage\u003c/a\u003e — from there, teams could prioritize and act on those vulnerabilities. The last piece we included was the relational data structure, which went beyond the event format data Comet provided, making it easier for us to process the data for further analysis.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThose motivations led us to start building Kitsune, our vulnerability management platform. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKitsune started as a backend API service that was to become the source of truth about vulnerabilities within Spotify, with a Backstage UI plugin for user interactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKitsune now works as our vulnerability lifecycle management system. Teams are automatically notified when vulnerabilities exist. And when necessary, Kitsune can escalate to appropriate stakeholders. We provide vulnerability list pages on Backstage, and teams can go there anytime to review the vulnerabilities that are assigned to them, such as before sprint planning, to include vulnerability fixes in their day-to-day work. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFunnels of vulnerability sources\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKitsune began with vulnerabilities reported by two reactive controls, one of which is the security bug bounty program \u003ca href=\"https://www.hackerone.com/company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eHackerOne\u003c/a\u003e. But we aimed to be able to handle vulnerabilities from other RCs, too. In order to keep the systems decoupled, we designed a limitation to Kitsune itself, so it handles business logic applied to vulnerabilities in general. We introduced the concept of a “mediator” that takes care of RC-specific business logic and converts the data to be compatible with Kitsune. After the launch of the mediator system, we were able to integrate the VMP with a few other RCs cleanly, and we are working to add more reactive controls to extend the coverage. Also, it’s common that a vulnerability is reported by other sources, including our employees, so we made it possible to upload manually reported vulnerabilities to Kitsune with a CSV file. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eMetrics\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" width=\"1999\" height=\"1406\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/10/Security-dashboard.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/10/Security-dashboard.png 1999w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/10/Security-dashboard-250x176.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/10/Security-dashboard-700x492.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/10/Security-dashboard-768x540.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/10/Security-dashboard-1536x1080.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/10/Security-dashboard-120x84.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eSample dashboard view.

One such obstacle was longer build times. During early testing performed last year, we ran the same builds on different machines and found that switching to Apple silicon for development could reduce iOS build times by 20% to 30% (and up to 50% with the new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips).

We set up a workstream dedicated to assist our developers while in the process of reaching full support. We then asked teams across the organisation to make sure dependencies and relevant tooling were accurately updated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGiven that these machines were proven to be better in terms of build performance, we recommended an expedited, out-of-the-normal-cycle machine upgrade for client developers. To do this, we needed to answer two questions: how should we prioritise within the client developer workforce? And how do we scale for a distributed-first workforce?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe prioritisation work was split into two streams: new (joiners) and current employees. For the first group, we collaborated with our colleagues in Tech Procurement and updated the available hardware in our “normal” tech cycle, making sure that new developers received the best setup from the start. For the second group, prioritisation was a bit more complicated. We decided to look at current hardware specifications, focusing on older models and those with lower RAM, as it was determined that both of these factors have significant impact on developer experience. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify, our distributed-first way of working allows us to have developers located around the world. And because of our commitment to reduce our carbon footprint, scaling this upgrade meant not only distributing the new machines, but also collecting the old ones to ensure they would be properly recycled. This was done in close collaboration with Tech Procurement and would not have been possible without the support from our client developer workforce. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis wasn’t a small undertaking. It involved shipping to hundreds of Spotifiers in 11 countries, with five different suppliers.

Along with our tech architecture and strategies, it has what every engineer needs to know about building software at Spotify, including best practices for reliability, compliance, security, cost management, and documentation. To that list of fundamental engineering priorities, we’ve now added climate awareness and responsibility.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eNecessary knowledge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWritten with our specific infrastructure and ways of working in mind, the climate engineering section of the handbook first helps engineers understand basic concepts (what are C02 emissions and how much is a metric ton of C02e, anyway) before explaining the main sources of emissions from Spotify’s streaming business. These fall into two broad categories:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDirect emissions\u003c/strong\u003e from using our product, including all our computing resources running in the cloud, as well all the phones, laptops, TVs, game consoles, and other devices running the Spotify app. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIndirect emissions\u003c/strong\u003e caused by related business activities, including emissions from our upstream partners, such as CDNs and mobile networks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom there, we keep digging deeper into the details. For example, we ask, what is the emissions cost of activating the radio chip on a phone? For cloud computing, we evaluate the power consumption of the server’s various components: how many watts come from CPU usage vs disk usage vs running the cooling fan? Learning everything we can about our sources of emissions helps our engineers target their efforts and maximize their impact, as well as discover unexploited opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDefining the scope of our climate impact remains an important focus area for our climate teams. And we hope to share more of what we learn about how to account for emissions from streaming in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eActionable advice\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe handbook also includes hands-on guides with the most impactful actions a Spotify engineer can take to reduce those emissions in their daily work, from prioritizing hardware acceleration to remembering to clean up their cloud resources after they’re done running an experiment (or a Hack Week project).

We have dedicated climate squads, just as we have dedicated security squads, but we want all of our engineers to have both security and climate responsibility on their minds as they do their work.

We want solutions that are themselves sustainable and whose impact can scale. Ideally, we are building a better, brighter future, not just buying our way out of the past.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eA technical challenge unlike any other\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom our efforts so far, we’ve recognized two equally important things: (1) sustainability can be treated just like any other engineering problem, something that we can invent, build, and optimize solutions for; and (2) the climate fight can be a deeply personal one, not just another engineering problem at all. It’s a cause that can’t be ignored any longer, and many of us feel compelled to contribute to it because of that sense of urgency. Approaching the problem from an engineer’s point of view allows us to turn our concerns into action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs engineers, we always want our work to have as much impact as possible. Even when we write a simple script that saves a couple of mouse clicks, we consider how two mouse clicks multiplied across hundreds of millions of users and billions of interactions scales to make a meaningful difference. We love to optimize as much as we love to invent: striving for 99.9999999% uptime, a website that’s a millisecond faster, an app download that’s 1 MB lighter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe already apply this impact-focused, problem-solving mindset to feature development, security, reliability, resource management, and other engineering priorities. Now it’s time to apply it to climate responsibility, too. Whether it’s how we build a new feature, fix a bug, design an API, or architect a system, sustainability should become part of our job descriptions as engineers, not a side gig; a specification, not an afterthought; a measure that distinguishes a good hack from a poor one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eAll hands on deck\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile our bottom-up approach is familiar — tapping into the speed of our many distributed but aligned teams — the enormity of the climate issue brings a passion and urgency to our efforts. Reducing our app’s download size by 1 MB takes on new significance when we realize the impact that 1 MB multiplied by hundreds of millions of listeners has on our carbon footprint. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe that climate change isn’t going to come from a single silver bullet to solve the problem. Instead it’s going to come from many different people united in making many changes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, not every piece of code we write can live up to some elegant ideal of engineering. Hacking is just as important, especially for finding new solutions to old problems. As we’ve seen from our bottom-up approach, a single week of hacks, and the creativity, ingenuity, and passion of Spotify’s distributed and diverse developer community, sometimes even the ugliest code can show us the best way forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n\n        Tags: \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/backend/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003ebackend\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/engineering-leadership/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003eengineering leadership\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e        \n            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

Based on that groundwork, we’ve established a process for algorithmic impact assessments (AIA) for both music and podcasts. These internal audits are an essential learning tool for our teams at Spotify. But AIAs are just one part of putting algorithmic responsibility into practice. AIAs are like maps, giving us an overview of a system and highlighting hotspots where product adjustments or research into directional changes are needed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eOwning the product and the process\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur AIAs prompt product owners to review their systems and create product roadmaps in order to consider potential issues that may impact listeners and creators. The assessments are not meant to serve as formal code audits for each system. Instead, the assessments call attention to where deeper investigation and work may be needed, such as product-specific guidance, deeper technical assessment, or external review. Just like products, impact assessments, auditing methods and standards also need iteration following a first phase rollout. Through further refinement and piloting, we expect to continue to learn how the impact assessment process and translation between cross-functional teams can be improved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eIncreasing accountability and visibility\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor product owners, performing an assessment not only reinforces best practices leading to actionable next steps, it also increases accountability since audits are shared with stakeholders across the organization and work is captured and prioritized on roadmaps. Taken together, AIAs help us see where we have the most work to do as a company, including added visibility into teams’ product plans. Along with helping teams outline and prioritize their work, assessments also help establish roles and responsibilities. The AIA process includes the appointment of formal product partners to work with the core algorithmic responsibility team. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eResults so far\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn less than a year, we’ve educated a significant number of Spotifiers and assessed more than a hundred systems across the company that play a role in our personalization and recommendation work.

We leverage the powerful cli and \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/tree/main/packages/utils\"\u003eNode-API\u003c/a\u003e to create a feedback report posted as a comment on each of the project’s pull requests, comparing against the latest results from master on key areas such as Web Vitals and performance budgets.

In addition to a good lab data setup, it’s vital to know how each change affects real users.

With our monitoring in place, we could assess the improvements our work would bring to real users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s the value real user data can give — you can kickstart investigations and dive deep into why certain metrics need improvement.

Based on that groundwork, we’ve established a process for algorithmic impact assessments (AIA) for both music and podcasts. These internal audits are an essential learning tool for our teams at Spotify. But AIAs are just one part of putting algorithmic responsibility into practice. AIAs are like maps, giving us an overview of a system and highlighting hotspots where product adjustments or research into directional changes are needed. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eOwning the product and the process\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur AIAs prompt product owners to review their systems and create product roadmaps in order to consider potential issues that may impact listeners and creators. The assessments are not meant to serve as formal code audits for each system. Instead, the assessments call attention to where deeper investigation and work may be needed, such as product-specific guidance, deeper technical assessment, or external review. Just like products, impact assessments, auditing methods and standards also need iteration following a first phase rollout. Through further refinement and piloting, we expect to continue to learn how the impact assessment process and translation between cross-functional teams can be improved.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eIncreasing accountability and visibility\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor product owners, performing an assessment not only reinforces best practices leading to actionable next steps, it also increases accountability since audits are shared with stakeholders across the organization and work is captured and prioritized on roadmaps. Taken together, AIAs help us see where we have the most work to do as a company, including added visibility into teams’ product plans. Along with helping teams outline and prioritize their work, assessments also help establish roles and responsibilities. The AIA process includes the appointment of formal product partners to work with the core algorithmic responsibility team. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eResults so far\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn less than a year, we’ve educated a significant number of Spotifiers and assessed more than a hundred systems across the company that play a role in our personalization and recommendation work.

Industry peers have indicated that translations have been one of their strongest drivers of growth over the years. When we first started thinking about Scaling Translations, Spotify was available in 25 languages. By increasing the number of supported languages from 26 to more than 60, we believed we could expand our reach and impact those users whose native languages were not supported at that time. We could also expand our total addressable market and make our product more accessible to an even more diverse user base.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe software engineering efforts needed\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo support the business case, it was essential to understand what was required on the tech side to pull off the effort. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, we needed to assess our technical landscape. We asked ourselves a number of questions — what capabilities exist today to support our ambitions? What are the pain points within our current architecture? How will these pain points be amplified when the number of supported languages has more than doubled? What new problems do we foresee both technically and organizationally?

It involved talking to software engineers, product managers, engineering managers, colleagues on the business side — all across the company. We also had to roll up our sleeves and dig through numerous different source code repositories, consult system diagrams, and analyze production metrics and telemetry. After concluding our deep dive, we summarized our findings in a comprehensive report — the 25-page write-up covered extensive details of existing systems, their interactions, use cases, business metrics, what capabilities we needed to develop, and the effort it would take. We proposed a direction for how to realize the business case and product vision using technology, and we also included several considered, but discarded, alternatives for the project for added context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the technical effort had been defined, we secured the required funding and staffing. Six months ahead of the scheduled release date, we hired a small, dedicated engineering team to focus on this project. This was the first time we’d had dedicated engineers work alongside our localization team on a joint project to launch new languages. The engineering team worked relentlessly to address the many pain points and required improvements outlined in the technical scoping document, collaborating with other engineering teams and business stakeholders across the company. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEfforts included defragmenting the existing tech stack, automating mundane linguistic quality-assurance tasks for our mobile apps, and using sophisticated automation to update 30+ backend services en masse to successfully integrate support for the new languages.

Because of the growing number of cyberattacks, software development stakeholders have been forced to implement security testing as the main track in SDLC to prevent vulnerabilities and flaws in applications or software (assets). A software security assessment scans for weaknesses with the goal of preventing bad actors from exploiting those weaknesses. And it’s not just applicable to one phase — it’s additional security at each software development phase (design, development, deployment, maintenance) and during product delivery.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSDLC at Spotify\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFrom an application security perspective at Spotify, we take into consideration the mindset, procedures, and solutions adopted inside our organization and in the software development life cycle to protect the applications we create and use. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo what are we doing to secure SDLC? Spotify’s application security program features several tools that scan applications and report vulnerabilities. We call them reactive controls. One of those reactive controls is Snyk. The lifecycle of vulnerabilities is tracked within the vulnerability management platform, providing a way for asset owners and operation teams to remediate vulnerabilities and manage risks according to internal vulnerability management policies, improving security. Through automation efforts, we’re able to keep our software, assets, and components healthy and up-to-date, providing an additional layer of strength in the security program. This has allowed us to scale more quickly and more safely. As we consume large quantities of software, such as libraries, services, application and infrastructure — each could be subject to supply chain attacks — we want to be sure that we can trust the software source and, in turn, remain a software supplier that won’t deliver malicious software to our customers. This is the main goal of the secure supply chain initiative — to prevent attacks that can target any phase of the software development life cycle. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe focus on two key areas when thinking about security testing in SDLC: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eCovering Spotify’s wide variety of languages and package managers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHaving a solution flexible enough to integrate into the existing CI/CD. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo address these areas, we integrated Snyk into Spotify’s build pipeline, giving us the ability to scan for vulnerabilities in review builds. We rolled this out in phases, prioritizing perimeter services and services with access to sensitive data. This tool already had support for almost every language and package manager that we wanted to support, and the Snyk team had plans to extend support into other areas that were of interest to us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat it looks like from a developer’s perspective\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify has thousands of engineers, so we were very intentional when implementing security testing automation, keeping developer needs top of mind and freeing up the developers to focus on their own priorities. For some languages and frameworks, we’ve automatically embedded vulnerability scanning in CI/CD pipelines, so the adoption has been seamless and hasn’t required any action from developers. For other languages and frameworks not covered by the automatic process, we’ve provided a simple guide for developers to enable Snyk scans as a build step for their application. Now the number of scanned projects continues to increase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe future of secure SDLC at Spotify\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAttack vectors are evolving as quickly as the software industry, and it’s important to provide a holistic approach to secure software development. One approach is to automatically generate fixes and merge them without any intervention from the engineering or security teams. In addition, we’re able to track the lifecycle of vulnerabilities by using various APIs provided by Snyk and integrating that data into our vulnerability management platform. Other approaches include source code analysis, fleet-wide upgrade through automation, and supply chain management to prevent vulnerabilities by focusing on security at every phase of development. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur mantra within the Security team at Spotify is to keep risking responsibly.

Before we adopted \u003ca href=\"https://www.lifeatspotify.com/being-here/work-from-anywhere\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eWork From Anywhere\u003c/a\u003e, it was common to see whiteboards filled with “boxes and arrows” when walking around the office. And if you got curious and wanted to understand what was represented on a whiteboard, you would probably have to ask someone on the team sitting next to the board to explain the boxes and arrows  to you. What do the boxes represent? Do they all mean the same thing? Do arrows indicate dependency or information flow? Whiteboard diagrams may look simple at a glance, but they can be hard to grasp without context or explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough diagrams on whiteboards may be adequate in smaller group settings, e.g., brainstorming sessions or mapping out existing system interactions in a meeting room, it’s not an approach that scales. It’s not practical to carry whiteboards around to spread knowledge, so they are constrained to a physical space. For a company with a distributed-first approach like Spotify has become, whiteboards aren’t always enough. Even though we transitioned our diagrams to digital tools, without conventions on how to visualize our software, the challenge remained. Software visualization is not a new problem, and there are many solutions out there — the most famous being the Unified Modeling Language (UML).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe needed a lightweight way to visualize software architecture, optimized for human-to-human communication. We wanted diagrams that would enable us to understand our software with minimal context. We looked at what our engineers were currently using and realized that the solution was right under our nose: the \u003ca href=\"https://c4model.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eC4 model\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eLeveraging the C4 model to create Spotify diagrams \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe C4 model is a lightweight and straightforward approach to visualizing software architecture. Besides outlining a few abstractions, C4 defines a standard notation and best practices for drawing diagrams of software systems. Overall, it provides good guidelines to ensure that software diagrams are understandable and are able to stand alone without additional context. C4 strikes a good balance between ad hoc “boxes and arrows” and overly formal standards, fitting like a glove to our needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eC4 comes with a collection of software abstractions. So how do we apply it alongside our own abstractions in the Spotify System Model? We don’t want to reinvent the wheel, so we kept C4 notation and best practices and replaced its abstraction layer with the Spotify System Model. Consequently, we had to redefine the set of core diagrams for documenting architecture and system design:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem landscape diagram:\u003c/strong\u003e Describes a set of related systems, how they are connected, and what external systems they depend on — for example, all systems owned by a squad or all systems in a domain\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem context diagram:\u003c/strong\u003e describes how a system fits in the larger context of dependencies, dependents, and users\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem components diagram:\u003c/strong\u003e Describes how one system is built up from individual components (known as container diagram in C4)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"700\" height=\"406\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Spotify-vs-C4-diagram-700x406.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Spotify-vs-C4-diagram-700x406.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Spotify-vs-C4-diagram-250x145.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Spotify-vs-C4-diagram-768x446.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Spotify-vs-C4-diagram-1536x891.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Spotify-vs-C4-diagram-120x70.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/Spotify-vs-C4-diagram.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eFigure 3.

This enables us to communicate and visualize our entire architecture using a common language and model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne great benefit of automating architectural diagrams is that they will always stay up to date with the intentional design as expressed in metadata; there will be no need for updating these as the system evolves, and no questioning whether the visualization is outdated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eextensible plugin system in Backstage\u003c/a\u003e has enabled us to easily add an \u003cem\u003eArchitecture\u003c/em\u003e tab, which renders a Spotify Component diagram of the system, to the system page. These diagrams are automatically generated using software metadata. External systems are linked from the diagram, enabling easy navigation between different system diagrams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe benefits of C4\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHaving the system model available in Backstage has been very helpful for discovery purposes, understanding lifecycles, ownership, and relationships between software components, and automatically producing software visualization diagrams. The system model and its visualizations also allow us to produce system designs using a universal language — both for new systems and the evolution of existing ones — which has been helpful for communication and has enabled improved cross-team collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, visualizing software using C4 provides a high-level overview that can be used to generate insights about repeating patterns, tech debt, and other learnings. This has been highly valuable for onboarding purposes, both for new joiners on teams and external stakeholders. As automated diagrams allow us to traverse the ecosystem interactively, it also makes it easy to understand how systems interconnect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eApplying C4\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you struggle to understand your software because it’s too complex—visualizing it with diagrams can be a great help. Since having an abstraction model is crucial to understanding software architecture at scale, you can use an existing model, like C4 or the Spotify System Model, or create a model that is tailored to your specific needs. It is also essential to have a standard notation for software diagrams that ensures that they are comprehensible; the C4 model does a fantastic job and can work as inspiration if you don’t want to adopt it entirely. If you’re going to take the next step and automate diagram generation, make sure you capture metadata about your software and build your software catalog. Having such a catalog will also help you achieve insights and better plan how to operate and evolve your software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Spotify grows, so does the size and complexity of our software. We need tools to better understand and communicate our software, and having standard core entities and abstractions is foundational. By getting inspiration and utilizing the notation and best practices from the C4 model, we’ve been able to leverage the Spotify System Model to create software visualizations that are easy to understand with minimal context. This combination has created a shared language that is used across the organization to help with communication, aid decision-making, and support our software’s evolution.

Before we adopted \u003ca href=\"https://www.lifeatspotify.com/being-here/work-from-anywhere\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eWork From Anywhere\u003c/a\u003e, it was common to see whiteboards filled with “boxes and arrows” when walking around the office. And if you got curious and wanted to understand what was represented on a whiteboard, you would probably have to ask someone on the team sitting next to the board to explain the boxes and arrows  to you. What do the boxes represent? Do they all mean the same thing? Do arrows indicate dependency or information flow? Whiteboard diagrams may look simple at a glance, but they can be hard to grasp without context or explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough diagrams on whiteboards may be adequate in smaller group settings, e.g., brainstorming sessions or mapping out existing system interactions in a meeting room, it’s not an approach that scales. It’s not practical to carry whiteboards around to spread knowledge, so they are constrained to a physical space. For a company with a distributed-first approach like Spotify has become, whiteboards aren’t always enough. Even though we transitioned our diagrams to digital tools, without conventions on how to visualize our software, the challenge remained. Software visualization is not a new problem, and there are many solutions out there — the most famous being the Unified Modeling Language (UML).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe needed a lightweight way to visualize software architecture, optimized for human-to-human communication. We wanted diagrams that would enable us to understand our software with minimal context. We looked at what our engineers were currently using and realized that the solution was right under our nose: the \u003ca href=\"https://c4model.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eC4 model\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eLeveraging the C4 model to create Spotify diagrams \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe C4 model is a lightweight and straightforward approach to visualizing software architecture. Besides outlining a few abstractions, C4 defines a standard notation and best practices for drawing diagrams of software systems. Overall, it provides good guidelines to ensure that software diagrams are understandable and are able to stand alone without additional context. C4 strikes a good balance between ad hoc “boxes and arrows” and overly formal standards, fitting like a glove to our needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eC4 comes with a collection of software abstractions. So how do we apply it alongside our own abstractions in the Spotify System Model? We don’t want to reinvent the wheel, so we kept C4 notation and best practices and replaced its abstraction layer with the Spotify System Model. Consequently, we had to redefine the set of core diagrams for documenting architecture and system design:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem landscape diagram:\u003c/strong\u003e Describes a set of related systems, how they are connected, and what external systems they depend on — for example, all systems owned by a squad or all systems in a domain\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem context diagram:\u003c/strong\u003e describes how a system fits in the larger context of dependencies, dependents, and users\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSystem components diagram:\u003c/strong\u003e Describes how one system is built up from individual components (known as container diagram in C4)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"700\" height=\"406\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/engineeringsite/1/2022/09/Spotify-vs-C4-diagram-700x406-1.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/09/Spotify-vs-C4-diagram-700x406-1.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/09/Spotify-vs-C4-diagram-700x406-1-250x145.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/09/Spotify-vs-C4-diagram-700x406-1-120x70.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eFigure 3.

This enables us to communicate and visualize our entire architecture using a common language and model.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne great benefit of automating architectural diagrams is that they will always stay up to date with the intentional design as expressed in metadata; there will be no need for updating these as the system evolves, and no questioning whether the visualization is outdated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://backstage.io/docs/plugins/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eextensible plugin system in Backstage\u003c/a\u003e has enabled us to easily add an \u003cem\u003eArchitecture\u003c/em\u003e tab, which renders a Spotify Component diagram of the system, to the system page. These diagrams are automatically generated using software metadata. External systems are linked from the diagram, enabling easy navigation between different system diagrams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe benefits of C4\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHaving the system model available in Backstage has been very helpful for discovery purposes, understanding lifecycles, ownership, and relationships between software components, and automatically producing software visualization diagrams. The system model and its visualizations also allow us to produce system designs using a universal language — both for new systems and the evolution of existing ones — which has been helpful for communication and has enabled improved cross-team collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, visualizing software using C4 provides a high-level overview that can be used to generate insights about repeating patterns, tech debt, and other learnings. This has been highly valuable for onboarding purposes, both for new joiners on teams and external stakeholders. As automated diagrams allow us to traverse the ecosystem interactively, it also makes it easy to understand how systems interconnect.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eApplying C4\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you struggle to understand your software because it’s too complex—visualizing it with diagrams can be a great help. Since having an abstraction model is crucial to understanding software architecture at scale, you can use an existing model, like C4 or the Spotify System Model, or create a model that is tailored to your specific needs. It is also essential to have a standard notation for software diagrams that ensures that they are comprehensible; the C4 model does a fantastic job and can work as inspiration if you don’t want to adopt it entirely. If you’re going to take the next step and automate diagram generation, make sure you capture metadata about your software and build your software catalog. Having such a catalog will also help you achieve insights and better plan how to operate and evolve your software.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Spotify grows, so does the size and complexity of our software. We need tools to better understand and communicate our software, and having standard core entities and abstractions is foundational. By getting inspiration and utilizing the notation and best practices from the C4 model, we’ve been able to leverage the Spotify System Model to create software visualizations that are easy to understand with minimal context. This combination has created a shared language that is used across the organization to help with communication, aid decision-making, and support our software’s evolution.

The campaigns typically run on various platforms such as the Spotify Homepage and the Premium page. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore recently, we wanted to run more campaigns throughout the year, perhaps during different holidays like Halloween or Easter. Rather than having one centralised team configuring campaigns across multiple markets, we wanted to create distributed teams local to each individual market responsible for tailoring campaigns to their respective audiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit of history\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, the Spotify website was a PHP monolith. As it began to grow, and the number of teams contributing to the repository grew, we occasionally found ourselves waiting on other teams with multiple pull requests blocked. Our Docker image to build the website took upwards of 30 minutes on developer machines and was slowing down, not speeding up, with the number of engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it came to running a holiday campaign at the end of the year, the responsible team was  burdened with a massive amount of work. Each page was created from the ground up across multiple markets — all of which required different market nuances, translations, and imagery. The entire preparation process took up to three months of development work. By expanding into more and more markets, it soon became a full-time job just to prepare for one end-of-year campaign. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eThe creation of Campaign Admin\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a hack week bid to optimise some of our developer workflows, we built a rudimentary platform called Campaign Admin. This tool enabled developers to upload imagery to a GCS bucket, configure certain strings within the website and in-app pages, and ultimately request translations for each local market. It was a great solution for simple campaigns and massively optimised the process of creating some of the campaigns. We were able to hand off some of the tasks of creating campaigns to an in-house team, and the developers were able to concentrate on optimisations of the website and some of the tooling. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, more efficiency led to more scope creep. By the end of the life of the platform, an internal user could change the components, colours, text, CSS, and small bits of HTML — all from within the tool. All this additional complexity within the tool made it almost unwieldy for our teams in marketing and it became increasingly easier to introduce errors to the website. The time came for us to replace the Campaign Admin tool — we now knew we were not creating a tool for developers anymore, but for internal users on the marketing team itself. We needed a better user interface and experience, with more guardrails to prevent errors. We also wanted to enhance the tooling to be able to provide the next generation of campaigns for the company. Enter the Spotify Toolbelt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Spotify Toolbelt\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause we identified that the website was slowing developers down, an initiative was underway to split the website into ‘verticals’. Each vertical was to be highly specific to a small part of the website and owned by a single team. The marketing pages section was one of the first verticals split from the original website monolith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"235\" height=\"232\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/07/The-Spotify-Toolbelt.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/07/The-Spotify-Toolbelt.png 235w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/07/The-Spotify-Toolbelt-120x118.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eExample of the routing layer with each vertical owned by separate teams.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe marketing vertical was a Node.js Express app, which was server-side rendering our in-house library of landing page React components. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eA powerful data source\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe data source for the marketing vertical was the first ‘tool’ built for the Spotify Toolbelt, aptly named Scheduler-API. Taking our learnings from Campaign Admin, we took our time designing the Scheduler-API, taking into account key feature requests including the ability to edit any component on the website or in-app pages — and to not be required to configure the same content for each different market multiple times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe came up with the concept of blueprints. Each blueprint would define a page, and these blueprints could be expanded into different markets. The next image is an example blueprint including modules for translations—these modules have placeholders such as the pricing for the offers to be displayed to the end external user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"700\" height=\"876\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example-700x876.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example-700x876.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example-250x313.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example-768x962.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example-120x150.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example.png 1182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eExample of the JSON blueprint with modules to be expanded.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDifferent modules could be added to each blueprint. The most commonly used blueprint module is the translation module. This enables strings to be embedded into the blueprint and then, during runtime, the corresponding string can be matched within our translation system for the appropriate market. These strings can also have other bits of data inserted, such as the user name, offer details, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn hand with our blueprints, we had to come up with a targeting system to determine which external users should be able to see which pages.

The campaigns typically run on various platforms such as the Spotify Homepage and the Premium page. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMore recently, we wanted to run more campaigns throughout the year, perhaps during different holidays like Halloween or Easter. Rather than having one centralised team configuring campaigns across multiple markets, we wanted to create distributed teams local to each individual market responsible for tailoring campaigns to their respective audiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA bit of history\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the past, the Spotify website was a PHP monolith. As it began to grow, and the number of teams contributing to the repository grew, we occasionally found ourselves waiting on other teams with multiple pull requests blocked. Our Docker image to build the website took upwards of 30 minutes on developer machines and was slowing down, not speeding up, with the number of engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it came to running a holiday campaign at the end of the year, the responsible team was  burdened with a massive amount of work. Each page was created from the ground up across multiple markets — all of which required different market nuances, translations, and imagery. The entire preparation process took up to three months of development work. By expanding into more and more markets, it soon became a full-time job just to prepare for one end-of-year campaign. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eThe creation of Campaign Admin\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a hack week bid to optimise some of our developer workflows, we built a rudimentary platform called Campaign Admin. This tool enabled developers to upload imagery to a GCS bucket, configure certain strings within the website and in-app pages, and ultimately request translations for each local market. It was a great solution for simple campaigns and massively optimised the process of creating some of the campaigns. We were able to hand off some of the tasks of creating campaigns to an in-house team, and the developers were able to concentrate on optimisations of the website and some of the tooling. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, more efficiency led to more scope creep. By the end of the life of the platform, an internal user could change the components, colours, text, CSS, and small bits of HTML — all from within the tool. All this additional complexity within the tool made it almost unwieldy for our teams in marketing and it became increasingly easier to introduce errors to the website. The time came for us to replace the Campaign Admin tool — we now knew we were not creating a tool for developers anymore, but for internal users on the marketing team itself. We needed a better user interface and experience, with more guardrails to prevent errors. We also wanted to enhance the tooling to be able to provide the next generation of campaigns for the company. Enter the Spotify Toolbelt.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Spotify Toolbelt\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause we identified that the website was slowing developers down, an initiative was underway to split the website into ‘verticals’. Each vertical was to be highly specific to a small part of the website and owned by a single team. The marketing pages section was one of the first verticals split from the original website monolith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"235\" height=\"232\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/The-Spotify-Toolbelt.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/The-Spotify-Toolbelt.png 235w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/The-Spotify-Toolbelt-120x118.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 235px) 100vw, 235px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eExample of the routing layer with each vertical owned by separate teams.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe marketing vertical was a Node.js Express app, which was server-side rendering our in-house library of landing page React components. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eA powerful data source\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe data source for the marketing vertical was the first ‘tool’ built for the Spotify Toolbelt, aptly named Scheduler-API. Taking our learnings from Campaign Admin, we took our time designing the Scheduler-API, taking into account key feature requests including the ability to edit any component on the website or in-app pages — and to not be required to configure the same content for each different market multiple times.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe came up with the concept of blueprints. Each blueprint would define a page, and these blueprints could be expanded into different markets. The next image is an example blueprint including modules for translations—these modules have placeholders such as the pricing for the offers to be displayed to the end external user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"700\" height=\"876\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example-700x876.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example-700x876.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example-250x313.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example-768x962.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example-120x150.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/JSON-Blueprint-Example.png 1182w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eExample of the JSON blueprint with modules to be expanded.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDifferent modules could be added to each blueprint. The most commonly used blueprint module is the translation module. This enables strings to be embedded into the blueprint and then, during runtime, the corresponding string can be matched within our translation system for the appropriate market. These strings can also have other bits of data inserted, such as the user name, offer details, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn hand with our blueprints, we had to come up with a targeting system to determine which external users should be able to see which pages.

So we asked the maintainers of MUI, Byte Buddy, Testcontainers, QOS.CH, and Yarn to share their thoughts — about the fund, life as independent maintainers, and more. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s what they had to say about the challenges of maintaining popular open source projects, what kind of impact the funds will have on their work, and other ways we can support the community.

This non-profit MUI organization supports the engineering effort of valued long-term community contributors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of impact do you think FOSS funds have on the open source ecosystem in general? Is any amount welcome? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact of FOSS funds depends on the order of magnitude of the contribution but any amount helps. To get an order of magnitude, a strong engineer working for one of the big four in the US costs above 200k USD/year to the organization. If every company would set up a FOSS fund, it would have a big impact on the dynamic of open source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn addition to the money, does exposure from the fund provide value, as well?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, exposure from the fund has marketing value for our project. MUI being one of the few projects that Spotify decided to fund is social proof. It’s helping us to convert interested visitors into users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are other ways you think the community and/or companies can better support open source?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe question is too broad for me to give a valuable answer. I think that it depends too much on the context. A generic answer would be: contribute to the business model of open source, regardless of its nature — [whether considering] the joy maintainers experience during their free time, the hiring hedge a big four [company gains, or] the commercial revenues of a company, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eRafael Winterhalter, Byte Buddy \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eRafael (\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/raphw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e@raphw\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e) is a full-stack software consultant, living and working in Oslo. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e“Bootstrapping is the hardest part, even with Byte Buddy I almost gave up multiple times as it’s often been too much as an after hours project.”\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kind of impact do you think FOSS funds have on the open source ecosystem in general?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can make money from open source, but if one only considers the bits that are likely attracting commercial clients, an open source library turns out much different. Getting money for open source that is not bound to a particular client’s problem allows you to explore new features or to rewrite documentation without sacrificing your own time or income. It gives you a much better feeling to have a pot of cash to compensate yourself from time taken away from my billable hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn addition to the money, does exposure from the fund provide value?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think most funded projects are already visible. Recurring donations can however give confidence in a project’s survivability as funding guarantees maintenance to some degree. Personally, I do not accept donations from individuals. It’s a nice gesture but small amounts do not help as I cannot spontaneously wind down clients for a day to work on something else. Larger or consistent payments on the other hand are however tremendously helpful as they can compensate for turning down some work to rather work on open source without burning a hole into your pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are other ways you think the community and/or companies can better support open source?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eScholarships would be a great option as donations are very non-committal. If I had an idea for a good project, submitted it, and could receive half a year’s funding to realize it, I might even start something else some day. Bootstrapping is the hardest part, even with Byte Buddy I almost gave up multiple times as it’s often been too much as an after hours project. Maintenance can be more easily split up to a few hours a week, but bootstrapping requires a lot more effort. I think there could be many more great open source libraries if people got a chance to write them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSergei Egorov, Testcontainers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eSergei (\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bsideup\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e@bsideup\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e) is co-founder of AtomicJar and Testcontainers, living and working in NYC.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe all learned from the log4j story that the OSS security is critical.

The fact that you, Spotify, found \u003cem\u003etime\u003c/em\u003e to sponsor a project, is a value contributed to it, because others will see it as an endorsement in some sense.

But that’s also something that FOSS developers sometimes cannot afford — security audits, or just having someone with security background to review the code and prevent non-secure code being released.

(The infrastructure put in place by GitHub may signal a change in that regard.) The current situation where many critical open source software (OSS) projects survive only by the sheer will of the maintainers, is not a particularly healthy situation. By providing funds, users of OSS projects show that they care.

Getting money for open source that is not bound to a particular client’s problem allows you to explore new features or to rewrite documentation without sacrificing your own time or income. It gives you a much better feeling to have a pot of cash to compensate yourself from time taken away from my billable hours.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn addition to the money, does exposure from the fund provide value?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI think most funded projects are already visible. Recurring donations can however give confidence in a project’s survivability as funding guarantees maintenance to some degree. Personally, I do not accept donations from individuals. It’s a nice gesture but small amounts do not help as I cannot spontaneously wind down clients for a day to work on something else. Larger or consistent payments on the other hand are however tremendously helpful as they can compensate for turning down some work to rather work on open source without burning a hole into your pocket.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are other ways you think the community and/or companies can better support open source?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eScholarships would be a great option as donations are very non-committal. If I had an idea for a good project, submitted it, and could receive half a year’s funding to realize it, I might even start something else some day. Bootstrapping is the hardest part, even with Byte Buddy I almost gave up multiple times as it’s often been too much as an after hours project. Maintenance can be more easily split up to a few hours a week, but bootstrapping requires a lot more effort.

As the business evolves, we need an infrastructure in place that can satisfy the varying needs of stakeholders across the company. To enable fast iterations and facilitate model training, we built a system that allows user forecasts to run both on demand and automatically every week, with the heavy hyperparameter tuning part running on the weekend. The system creates visualizations and automated insights to surface information, and provides easy-to-use tools for manual interventions for both data scientists and business stakeholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify, many company key metrics are forecasted quarterly, weekly, or daily to help the business monitor performance, make business decisions, and improve our product offerings. Some of these metrics can be difficult to forecast given their volatile characteristics and pose interesting time series forecasting problems. User forecasts are one such metric, and are especially important to get as accurate as possible given they inform business decision-making and are one of the most used business health indicators. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Q1 of 2020, we started the process of upgrading our infrastructure with the goal of having automated, high-quality market-level forecasts that could run weekly and on demand.

We remove one time disruptions that bias the forecast, so the models do not propagate the pattern into the future. After that, model training and inference begins. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eNew markets\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNew markets are newly launched, or soon-to-be launched, markets, and therefore have a limited set of data that data scientists can work with. For these markets, we developed an in-house, proxy-based model. External data like macroeconomics and music-related data are used to train clustering models to learn “proxy” markets among the launched markets.

We decided to apply strict quality control on “core logic” (e.g., model implementation), which we deemed as extremely important to be bug free and logically correct, allowing for more flexibility in “peripheral logic” (e.g., chart/email creations). Core logics are packaged in a Python library, which is unit tested, strictly peer reviewed, and well documented for every new release, while developers can create extensions in the system or experiment with models that are not subject to such standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eScaling is magical, but not always the solution\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can be smart with our model choices and reduce computational burden with models well suited for the problem at hand. Research can also help narrow down the hyperparameter space and reduce brute-force searches through the part of space that has limited or no impact on the final outcome. Since there is heavy overhead involved with parallelization, we should only use it when necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSimplicity\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have to strike a balance between simplicity and incremental improvement on model accuracy. Often decisions have to be made on whether to build additional logic into the core of the system, or to build it as an extension, or discard the change as costs outweigh benefits. Teams may have the tendency to lean toward building additional features at the cost of system health, but it’s important to always have the big picture in mind. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eAcknowledgments\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe forecasting infrastructure was built by Molly Zhu, Grant Webb, Michael Frings, Paul Levande, and Gabriel Araujo de Almeida, with contributions from Kelly Ho and Kathy Gao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePassionate about financial engineering (FINE) at Spotify? \u003ca href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/spotify/4fa0e36d-3b80-4d62-aec9-56d650f28792\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eWe are hiring\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLook out for upcoming posts on methodologies, research, and work in development. \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n\n        Tags: \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/backend/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003ebackend\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e        \n            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

As the business evolves, we need an infrastructure in place that can satisfy the varying needs of stakeholders across the company. To enable fast iterations and facilitate model training, we built a system that allows user forecasts to run both on demand and automatically every week, with the heavy hyperparameter tuning part running on the weekend. The system creates visualizations and automated insights to surface information, and provides easy-to-use tools for manual interventions for both data scientists and business stakeholders.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify, many company key metrics are forecasted quarterly, weekly, or daily to help the business monitor performance, make business decisions, and improve our product offerings. Some of these metrics can be difficult to forecast given their volatile characteristics and pose interesting time series forecasting problems. User forecasts are one such metric, and are especially important to get as accurate as possible given they inform business decision-making and are one of the most used business health indicators. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn Q1 of 2020, we started the process of upgrading our infrastructure with the goal of having automated, high-quality market-level forecasts that could run weekly and on demand.

We decided to apply strict quality control on “core logic” (e.g., model implementation), which we deemed as extremely important to be bug free and logically correct, allowing for more flexibility in “peripheral logic” (e.g., chart/email creations). Core logics are packaged in a Python library, which is unit tested, strictly peer reviewed, and well documented for every new release, while developers can create extensions in the system or experiment with models that are not subject to such standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eScaling is magical, but not always the solution\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can be smart with our model choices and reduce computational burden with models well suited for the problem at hand. Research can also help narrow down the hyperparameter space and reduce brute-force searches through the part of space that has limited or no impact on the final outcome. Since there is heavy overhead involved with parallelization, we should only use it when necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSimplicity\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have to strike a balance between simplicity and incremental improvement on model accuracy. Often decisions have to be made on whether to build additional logic into the core of the system, or to build it as an extension, or discard the change as costs outweigh benefits. Teams may have the tendency to lean toward building additional features at the cost of system health, but it’s important to always have the big picture in mind. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eAcknowledgments\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe forecasting infrastructure was built by Molly Zhu, Grant Webb, Michael Frings, Paul Levande, and Gabriel Araujo de Almeida, with contributions from Kelly Ho and Kathy Gao.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePassionate about financial engineering (FINE) at Spotify? \u003ca href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/spotify/4fa0e36d-3b80-4d62-aec9-56d650f28792\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eWe are hiring\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLook out for upcoming posts on methodologies, research, and work in development. \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n\n        Tags: \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/backend/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003ebackend\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e        \n            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

Basic Pitch uses machine learning to transcribe the musical notes in a recording. Drop a recording of almost any instrument, including your voice, then get back a MIDI version, just like that. Unlike similar ML models, Basic Pitch is not only versatile and accurate, but also fast and computationally lightweight. It was built for artists and producers who want an easy way to turn their recorded ideas into MIDI, a standard for representing notes used in digital music production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eBasic Pitch is not your average MIDI converter\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the past 40 years, musicians have been using computers to compose, produce, and perform music, everywhere from bedrooms to concert halls. Most of this computer-based music uses a digital standard called MIDI (pronounced “MID-ee”). MIDI acts like sheet music for computers — it describes what notes are played and when — in a format that’s easy to edit. Did a note sound weird in that chord you played? Change it with a click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile MIDI is used by nearly all modern musicians, creating compositions from scratch with MIDI can be a challenge. Usually, musicians have to produce MIDI notes using some sort of computer interface, like a MIDI keyboard, or by typing the notes into their software by hand. This is because live performances on real instruments are typically difficult for a computer to interpret: once a performance has been recorded, the individual notes that were played are tricky to separate and identify. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a real problem for musicians who primarily sing their ideas, but aren’t familiar with piano keyboards or complex music software. For other musicians, having to compose on a MIDI keyboard or manually assembling an entire MIDI score note by note, mouse click by mouse click, can be creatively constraining and tedious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eMighty, speedy, and more expressive MIDI\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo solve this problem, researchers at \u003ca href=\"https://research.atspotify.com/audio-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify’s Audio Intelligence Lab\u003c/a\u003e teamed up with our friends at \u003ca href=\"https://soundtrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSoundtrap\u003c/a\u003e to build Basic Pitch — a machine learning model that turns a variety of instrumental performances into MIDI. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile other note-detection systems have existed for years, Basic Pitch offers a number of advantages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePolyphonic + instrument-agnostic:\u003c/strong\u003e Unlike most other note-detection algorithms, Basic Pitch can track multiple notes at a time and across various instruments, including piano, guitar, and ocarina. Many systems limit users to only monophonic output (one note at a time, like a single vocal melody), or are built for only one kind of instrument.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePitch bend detection:\u003c/strong\u003e Instruments, like guitar or the human voice, allow for more expressiveness through pitch bending: vibrato, glissando, bends, slides, etc. However, this valuable information is often lost when turning audio into MIDI. Basic Pitch supports this right out of the box.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpeed:\u003c/strong\u003e Basic Pitch is light on resources, and is able to run faster than real time on most modern computers (\u003ca href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9746549\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBittner et al. 2022\u003c/a\u003e). \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy combining these properties, Basic Pitch lets you take input from a variety of instruments and easily turn it into MIDI output, with a high degree of nuance and accuracy.

So now they can capture their ideas whenever inspiration strikes and get a head start on their compositions using the instrument of their choice, whether that’s guitar, flugelhorn, or their own voice. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEasy peasy! Well…\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDoes better always have to mean bigger?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo build Basic Pitch, we trained a neural network to predict MIDI note events given audio input. In general, it’s hard to make systems that are both accurate and efficient. Usually in ML, to make things more accurate, the easiest way is to add more data and make our models bigger. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we look around at popular ML models today, we see a tendency toward computationally extreme solutions. Think OpenAI’s Jukebox with its billions of parameters, or DALL-E and its 12 billion parameters, or Meta’s OPT-175B, a 175-billion-parameter large language model. Large models with targeted use cases can have very good results: using a dataset with tons of piano audio will be effective at recognizing piano input. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut we wanted a model that could work with input from a variety of instruments and polyphonic recordings to create a tool that’s useful for piano virtuosos as well as shower crooners. Did that automatically mean building a mega model? Or, could we build a model that did more (recognize notes played by a much wider range of instruments), but that was also lighter, and just as accurate, as a heavier, more power-hungry solution?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the challenge we set for ourselves. But to accomplish that, we would have to address a number of transcription problems specific to music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eMusic, musicians, and machine learning\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince we set out to build this tool for musicians, not just researchers, we knew speed was important. No matter how impressive your ML model, no one enjoys waiting around for the results, especially if they’re in the middle of doing something creative. Inspiration doesn’t like progress bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eReducing the model size would help with speed. But the goal of creating a fast, light, \u003cem\u003eand accurate\u003c/em\u003e ML model presented a few challenges that are specific to music audio: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen music is polyphonic, lots of the sounds overlap in both time and frequency. For example, if a piano plays C3 and C4 at the same time, the notes share a lot of similar harmonic frequency content. This makes it hard to “untangle”.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt’s not always easy to know when to group pitches into a single note, or when to break them into multiple notes. In the example clip below🐕, listen to the way the singer scoops around different notes in “\u003cem\u003esooooong\u003c/em\u003e” and “\u003cem\u003eaboooout\u003c/em\u003e”, etc. How many notes are there in the word “song”? Two, three…five-ish? Depending on who you are, you might hear it differently.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003caudio controls=\"\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/06/vocadito_6.mp3\"\u003e\u003c/audio\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt’s hard to make an ML system that transcribes any instrument well. There are some really good models out there for instruments like the piano. Even making a model that transcribes any type of piano well is difficult.

But we wanted to share it with even more creators, whether they were musicians, developers, or both. So we open sourced the model and made the tool available online for anyone to use. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, Basic Pitch gives musicians a great starting point for transcriptions, instead of having to write all their musical ideas down manually from scratch or buying extra MIDI hardware. This library comes with a standard open source license and can be used for any purpose, including integrating it with other music production tools. We can also imagine how the model could be integrated into real-time systems — for example, allowing a live performance to be automatically accompanied by other MIDI instruments that “react” to what the performer is playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also wanted to share our approach for building lightweight models so other ML researchers might be inspired to do the same. For certain use cases, the large, computationally heavy, and energy-hungry models make sense. Sometimes they’re the best and only solution. But we don’t think this should be the only approach — and certainly not the default one. If you go in thinking you can create a leaner ML model, you probably can (and should 🌏).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that Basic Pitch is out there for music creators, software engineers, and researchers to use, develop, and build upon, we can’t wait to see what everyone does with it. No matter how much we test a model in our experiments, there’s still nothing like seeing how it performs out in the wild, with real-world use cases. In this initial version of Basic Pitch, we expect to discover many areas for improvement, along with new possibilities for how it could be used. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWant to help us improve Basic Pitch or have an idea for building something great with it? \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eLet us know in the repo\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBasic Pitch was built by:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRachel Bittner, Juanjo Bosch, Vincent Degroote, Brian Dombrowski, Simon Durand, Sebastian Ewert, Gabriel Meseguer Brocal, Nicola Montecchio, Adam Rackis, David Rubinstein, Ching Sung, Scott Sheffield, Peter Sobot, Daniel Stoller, Charae Tongg, and Jan Van Balen\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eReferences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBalhar, Jirí and Jan Hajič, Jr. “\u003ca href=\"https://www.music-ir.org/mirex/abstracts/2019/BH1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eMelody Extraction Using a Harmonic Convolutional Neural Network\u003c/a\u003e.” (2018).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBittner, Rachel, Juan José Bosch, David Rubinstein, Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal, and Sebastian Ewert. “\u003ca href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9746549\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eA Lightweight Instrument-Agnostic Model for Polyphonic Note Transcription and Multipitch Estimation\u003c/a\u003e.” \u003cem\u003e47th International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing\u003c/em\u003e (May 2022).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBittner, Rachel, Brian McFee, Justin Salamon, Peter Li, and Juan P.

Basic Pitch uses machine learning to transcribe the musical notes in a recording. Drop a recording of almost any instrument, including your voice, then get back a MIDI version, just like that. Unlike similar ML models, Basic Pitch is not only versatile and accurate, but also fast and computationally lightweight. It was built for artists and producers who want an easy way to turn their recorded ideas into MIDI, a standard for representing notes used in digital music production.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eBasic Pitch is not your average MIDI converter\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the past 40 years, musicians have been using computers to compose, produce, and perform music, everywhere from bedrooms to concert halls. Most of this computer-based music uses a digital standard called MIDI (pronounced “MID-ee”). MIDI acts like sheet music for computers — it describes what notes are played and when — in a format that’s easy to edit. Did a note sound weird in that chord you played? Change it with a click.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile MIDI is used by nearly all modern musicians, creating compositions from scratch with MIDI can be a challenge. Usually, musicians have to produce MIDI notes using some sort of computer interface, like a MIDI keyboard, or by typing the notes into their software by hand. This is because live performances on real instruments are typically difficult for a computer to interpret: once a performance has been recorded, the individual notes that were played are tricky to separate and identify. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a real problem for musicians who primarily sing their ideas, but aren’t familiar with piano keyboards or complex music software. For other musicians, having to compose on a MIDI keyboard or manually assembling an entire MIDI score note by note, mouse click by mouse click, can be creatively constraining and tedious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eMighty, speedy, and more expressive MIDI\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo solve this problem, researchers at \u003ca href=\"https://research.atspotify.com/audio-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify’s Audio Intelligence Lab\u003c/a\u003e teamed up with our friends at \u003ca href=\"https://soundtrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSoundtrap\u003c/a\u003e to build Basic Pitch — a machine learning model that turns a variety of instrumental performances into MIDI. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile other note-detection systems have existed for years, Basic Pitch offers a number of advantages:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePolyphonic + instrument-agnostic:\u003c/strong\u003e Unlike most other note-detection algorithms, Basic Pitch can track multiple notes at a time and across various instruments, including piano, guitar, and ocarina.

Well…\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDoes better always have to mean bigger?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo build Basic Pitch, we trained a neural network to predict MIDI note events given audio input. In general, it’s hard to make systems that are both accurate and efficient. Usually in ML, to make things more accurate, the easiest way is to add more data and make our models bigger. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we look around at popular ML models today, we see a tendency toward computationally extreme solutions. Think OpenAI’s Jukebox with its billions of parameters, or DALL-E and its 12 billion parameters, or Meta’s OPT-175B, a 175-billion-parameter large language model. Large models with targeted use cases can have very good results: using a dataset with tons of piano audio will be effective at recognizing piano input. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut we wanted a model that could work with input from a variety of instruments and polyphonic recordings to create a tool that’s useful for piano virtuosos as well as shower crooners. Did that automatically mean building a mega model? Or, could we build a model that did more (recognize notes played by a much wider range of instruments), but that was also lighter, and just as accurate, as a heavier, more power-hungry solution?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat was the challenge we set for ourselves. But to accomplish that, we would have to address a number of transcription problems specific to music.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eMusic, musicians, and machine learning\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince we set out to build this tool for musicians, not just researchers, we knew speed was important. No matter how impressive your ML model, no one enjoys waiting around for the results, especially if they’re in the middle of doing something creative. Inspiration doesn’t like progress bars.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eReducing the model size would help with speed. But the goal of creating a fast, light, \u003cem\u003eand accurate\u003c/em\u003e ML model presented a few challenges that are specific to music audio: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen music is polyphonic, lots of the sounds overlap in both time and frequency. For example, if a piano plays C3 and C4 at the same time, the notes share a lot of similar harmonic frequency content. This makes it hard to “untangle”.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt’s not always easy to know when to group pitches into a single note, or when to break them into multiple notes. In the example clip below?, listen to the way the singer scoops around different notes in “\u003cem\u003esooooong\u003c/em\u003e” and “\u003cem\u003eaboooout\u003c/em\u003e”, etc. How many notes are there in the word “song”? Two, three…five-ish? Depending on who you are, you might hear it differently.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003caudio controls=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/06/vocadito_6.mp3\"\u003e\u003c/audio\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt’s hard to make an ML system that transcribes any instrument well. There are some really good models out there for instruments like the piano. Even making a model that transcribes any type of piano well is difficult. (Think about all the different sound qualities of different piano recordings — a Steinway grand in a concert hall, an out-of-tune upright in a honky-tonk, etc.). It’s even harder to make a model that works well on any instrument, which ranges from a kazoo to a soprano opera singer.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo how did we do?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eAn ML model with a lightweight footprint\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the end, the model for Basic Pitch was made to be lightweight by using a combination of tricks drawing on past research from Spotify’s Audio Intelligence Lab and other researchers, including: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUsing a harmonic constant-Q transform as input (\u003ca href=\"https://archives.ismir.net/ismir2017/paper/000085.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBittner et al. 2017\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.music-ir.org/mirex/abstracts/2019/BH1.pdf\"\u003eBalhar 2018\u003c/a\u003e)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJointly modeling the onsets, frames (\u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05153\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eKelz et al. 2016\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11153\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eHawthorne et al. 2018\u003c/a\u003e), and multipitch information (\u003ca href=\"https://www.music-ir.org/mirex/abstracts/2019/BH1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBittner et al. 2017\u003c/a\u003e) \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJust using fewer layers and fewer parameters!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn our experiments, the shallow architecture and the tricks above resulted in a lightweight model with a high level of accuracy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eShallow architecture\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"1999\" height=\"984\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/06/Architecture.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/06/Architecture.png 1999w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/06/Architecture-250x123.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/06/Architecture-700x345.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/06/Architecture-768x378.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/06/Architecture-1536x756.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/06/Architecture-120x59.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1999px) 100vw, 1999px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eIn order to allow for a small model, Basic Pitch was built with a harmonic stacking layer and three types of outputs: onsets, notes, and pitch bends.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCompared to other AI systems, which can require massive amounts of energy-intensive processing to run, Basic Pitch is positively svelte, at \u0026lt;20 MB peak memory and \u0026lt;17K parameters.

But we wanted to share it with even more creators, whether they were musicians, developers, or both. So we open sourced the model and made the tool available online for anyone to use. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRight now, Basic Pitch gives musicians a great starting point for transcriptions, instead of having to write all their musical ideas down manually from scratch or buying extra MIDI hardware. This library comes with a standard open source license and can be used for any purpose, including integrating it with other music production tools. We can also imagine how the model could be integrated into real-time systems — for example, allowing a live performance to be automatically accompanied by other MIDI instruments that “react” to what the performer is playing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also wanted to share our approach for building lightweight models so other ML researchers might be inspired to do the same. For certain use cases, the large, computationally heavy, and energy-hungry models make sense. Sometimes they’re the best and only solution. But we don’t think this should be the only approach — and certainly not the default one. If you go in thinking you can create a leaner ML model, you probably can (and should ?).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that Basic Pitch is out there for music creators, software engineers, and researchers to use, develop, and build upon, we can’t wait to see what everyone does with it. No matter how much we test a model in our experiments, there’s still nothing like seeing how it performs out in the wild, with real-world use cases. In this initial version of Basic Pitch, we expect to discover many areas for improvement, along with new possibilities for how it could be used. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWant to help us improve Basic Pitch or have an idea for building something great with it? \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spotify/basic-pitch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eLet us know in the repo\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBasic Pitch was built by:\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRachel Bittner, Juanjo Bosch, Vincent Degroote, Brian Dombrowski, Simon Durand, Sebastian Ewert, Gabriel Meseguer Brocal, Nicola Montecchio, Adam Rackis, David Rubinstein, Ching Sung, Scott Sheffield, Peter Sobot, Daniel Stoller, Charae Tongg, and Jan Van Balen\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eReferences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBalhar, Jirí and Jan Hajič, Jr. “\u003ca href=\"https://www.music-ir.org/mirex/abstracts/2019/BH1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eMelody Extraction Using a Harmonic Convolutional Neural Network\u003c/a\u003e.” (2018).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBittner, Rachel, Juan José Bosch, David Rubinstein, Gabriel Meseguer-Brocal, and Sebastian Ewert. “\u003ca href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9746549\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eA Lightweight Instrument-Agnostic Model for Polyphonic Note Transcription and Multipitch Estimation\u003c/a\u003e.” \u003cem\u003e47th International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing\u003c/em\u003e (May 2022).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBittner, Rachel, Brian McFee, Justin Salamon, Peter Li, and Juan P.

From increasing the impact of the projects we open source, to starting a fund for independent maintainers, to partnering with other companies to help ensure open source software is more secure for all of us, we’re investing in a more open future inside and outside of Spotify. And we hope others will join us in efforts like these — exploring different ways of contributing to the entire open source ecosystem — so that the ever-expanding global community of developers can continue to thrive, wherever the future takes us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOpen from the beginning\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify has used open source technology since our early days. We’ve come a long way since then and so has the open source community. Now, almost every company (not just tech companies) depends on some kind of open source software for its business, whether it’s a simple library or framework or the sophisticated infrastructure used to deploy services around the world on a daily basis. But while the prevalence and importance of open source software keeps growing, the ecosystem that sustains it still needs to catch up as we start to see more and more maintainers getting burned out while doing excellent work that tons of people benefit from.

However, starting at 3, these are localized failures that can be prevented and/or mitigated by taking known and well-understood preventative actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t to say that prevention is free or easy. But, by defining a service level objective (SLO), we are setting an error budget — if we can stay within our error budget without a preventative measure, we should. That just means we can spend our time working on improving other aspects of the user experience and, ultimately, focusing on our core mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHumans don’t like paperwork\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the last few years, the DevOps Research and Assessment, or \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDORA\u003c/a\u003e, has produced an annual “State of DevOps” report. They survey thousands of industry professionals and determine what makes engineering efforts tick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTwo of the “golden metrics” they have identified are “Mean Time To Recover” and “Change Fail Rate”. These two metrics can mean different things to different orgs. It can be tempting to see them as the end of a conversation about reliability, but they are more like a map, helping us understand where we are, and where we want to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor our 2021 incident study, we carefully looked at every S4A-related incident timeline as recorded, and then the supporting evidence in order to establish a clear picture of each incident’s Time to Recover (TTR).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe found that about 50% of the time, no attempt was made to record a start and end time. And when people did make an attempt at recording their time to recover, about 81% of the time we had to adjust the time entered by more than 5 minutes to reflect the true number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t a failing of operators, but a failing of the system. We asked folks to fill out some paperwork, but we didn’t pair it with an incentive model, and predictably, they opted to spend their time on things with greater incentives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaving synthetic tests reduces time to recover\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter this work involving timelines, we got some signals on time to recover. One such signal was that TTR was all over the place and genuinely hard to correlate with any single aspect of our systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, we got a hit. One of the more exciting things we learned through our incident study was that synthetic testing works. We spent a fair amount of time grading whether or not a synthetic test would have plausibly detected outages, and then looked at the TTR for those that were in fact detected by synthetic tests, versus those that were not because they were not covered by a synthetic test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe results were even more striking than we thought. We found that incidents involving coverable features that did have a synthetic test saw a recovery time that was generally \u003cstrong\u003e10 times faster.\u003c/strong\u003e No really, read it again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis may seem obvious, but we never want to discount the power of data to drive decisions. This isn’t just a curiosity. We’ve adjusted our priorities to put a greater emphasis on synthetic testing, as we think it’s pretty important to get things back up and running as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo remember…\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you take something away from this post, I hope it’s an appreciation for the power of celebrating incidents as learning opportunities. Whether studying incidents as a collection, the way we did, or taking time to learn from them in your own context, there’s simply no replacement for this real-world source of data. It may seem tedious to interrupt your flow to investigate the failure. However, we think it’s vital to do so if you want to grow and sustain your service’s uptime.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf this tale has captured your imagination, and you are interested in working on a data-driven, reliability-focused team, \u003ca href=\"https://jobs.lever.co/spotify/bfce3ecc-18f0-4d6f-96ea-4df3476da21c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ecome join us\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n\n        Tags: \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/backend/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003ebackend\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/engineering-leadership/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003eengineering leadership\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e        \n            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

However, starting at 3, these are localized failures that can be prevented and/or mitigated by taking known and well-understood preventative actions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t to say that prevention is free or easy. But, by defining a service level objective (SLO), we are setting an error budget — if we can stay within our error budget without a preventative measure, we should. That just means we can spend our time working on improving other aspects of the user experience and, ultimately, focusing on our core mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHumans don’t like paperwork\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the last few years, the DevOps Research and Assessment, or \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDORA\u003c/a\u003e, has produced an annual “State of DevOps” report. They survey thousands of industry professionals and determine what makes engineering efforts tick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTwo of the “golden metrics” they have identified are “Mean Time To Recover” and “Change Fail Rate”. These two metrics can mean different things to different orgs. It can be tempting to see them as the end of a conversation about reliability, but they are more like a map, helping us understand where we are, and where we want to go.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor our 2021 incident study, we carefully looked at every S4A-related incident timeline as recorded, and then the supporting evidence in order to establish a clear picture of each incident’s Time to Recover (TTR).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe found that about 50% of the time, no attempt was made to record a start and end time. And when people did make an attempt at recording their time to recover, about 81% of the time we had to adjust the time entered by more than 5 minutes to reflect the true number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t a failing of operators, but a failing of the system. We asked folks to fill out some paperwork, but we didn’t pair it with an incentive model, and predictably, they opted to spend their time on things with greater incentives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHaving synthetic tests reduces time to recover\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter this work involving timelines, we got some signals on time to recover. One such signal was that TTR was all over the place and genuinely hard to correlate with any single aspect of our systems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, we got a hit. One of the more exciting things we learned through our incident study was that synthetic testing works. We spent a fair amount of time grading whether or not a synthetic test would have plausibly detected outages, and then looked at the TTR for those that were in fact detected by synthetic tests, versus those that were not because they were not covered by a synthetic test.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe results were even more striking than we thought. We found that incidents involving coverable features that did have a synthetic test saw a recovery time that was generally \u003cstrong\u003e10 times faster.\u003c/strong\u003e No really, read it again!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis may seem obvious, but we never want to discount the power of data to drive decisions. This isn’t just a curiosity. We’ve adjusted our priorities to put a greater emphasis on synthetic testing, as we think it’s pretty important to get things back up and running as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo remember…\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you take something away from this post, I hope it’s an appreciation for the power of celebrating incidents as learning opportunities. Whether studying incidents as a collection, the way we did, or taking time to learn from them in your own context, there’s simply no replacement for this real-world source of data. It may seem tedious to interrupt your flow to investigate the failure.

Creators are able to create rooms and stream live directly to fans who join the room. They can also interact directly with their fans either by text chatting in the app or bringing them up as speakers to interact by voice. But what about when the room ends? A creator could have had an incredible conversation they might want to preserve or redistribute, but once the room ends, the audio is lost. The biggest feedback we received from our creators was their desire to be able to natively record and distribute the live room chats to their audience after the room has ended. Knowing this, we got to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify Live appeals to creators by offering them the ability to record a stream for rerelease as a podcast for fans who could not make the live event. This is a low-friction way creators can create high-quality conversational recordings. Without this feature, creators creating conversational content would either need to record on their own device, compromising the audio quality of the other speakers, or they would need to have every speaker record their own audio and manually sync and mix the audio tracks. In this post, you’ll be walked through how a recording starts, processes, and distributes to the room creator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eRoom creation and starting the recording\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"624\" height=\"189\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/04/Steps-for-recording.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/04/Steps-for-recording.png 624w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/04/Steps-for-recording-250x76.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/04/Steps-for-recording-120x36.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the Host creates the room, they simply select the option to record and provide an email where we can send a copy of the recording.

We have even seen situations where a recording contains the audio of only one speaker. We discovered that these errors would often occur due to issues in the real-time audio layer. In order to solve this, we implemented various callbacks from the real-time audio service into the Recording Service to handle these events.

Creators are able to create rooms and stream live directly to fans who join the room. They can also interact directly with their fans either by text chatting in the app or bringing them up as speakers to interact by voice. But what about when the room ends? A creator could have had an incredible conversation they might want to preserve or redistribute, but once the room ends, the audio is lost. The biggest feedback we received from our creators was their desire to be able to natively record and distribute the live room chats to their audience after the room has ended. Knowing this, we got to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify Live appeals to creators by offering them the ability to record a stream for rerelease as a podcast for fans who could not make the live event. This is a low-friction way creators can create high-quality conversational recordings. Without this feature, creators creating conversational content would either need to record on their own device, compromising the audio quality of the other speakers, or they would need to have every speaker record their own audio and manually sync and mix the audio tracks. In this post, you’ll be walked through how a recording starts, processes, and distributes to the room creator.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eRoom creation and starting the recording\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"624\" height=\"189\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Steps-for-recording.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Steps-for-recording.png 624w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Steps-for-recording-250x76.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/Steps-for-recording-120x36.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 1\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the Host creates the room, they simply select the option to record and provide an email where we can send a copy of the recording.

We have even seen situations where a recording contains the audio of only one speaker. We discovered that these errors would often occur due to issues in the real-time audio layer. In order to solve this, we implemented various callbacks from the real-time audio service into the Recording Service to handle these events.

We hope to see more companies coming together to support that community, whether it’s with their own FOSS funds or some other program.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eParticipating in and giving back to the open source community has been a part of Spotify’s engineering culture from day one. Over the past decade we’ve open sourced \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spotify\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003emore than 200 tools\u003c/a\u003e to the public, and our flagship project, \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/43cbJh4ccRD7lzM2730YK3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBackstage\u003c/a\u003e, was recently promoted to a \u003ca href=\"https://www.cncf.io/blog/2022/03/15/backstage-project-joins-the-cncf-incubator/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eCNCF incubating project\u003c/a\u003e. Now it’s time for us to do more to ensure this community continues to thrive even as it continues to grow — and we invite more companies to join us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new fund will have a direct impact on the sustainability of specific open source projects. But it’s only one approach. In order to create a truly sustainable ecosystem, we need to explore as many solutions as possible. We need solutions that scale and to build partnerships with other companies in order to make a significant impact.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn that spirit, we’ve also just joined the \u003ca href=\"https://openssf.org/press-release/2022/03/01/open-source-security-foundation-attracts-new-commitments-advances-key-initiatives-in-weeks-since-white-house-security-summit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eOpen Source Security Foundation\u003c/a\u003e (OpenSSF) to support the world’s most important open source security initiatives and help ensure everyone can depend on a healthy and secure software ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’re excited about the potential to be a leading force for open source recognition and we can’t wait to continue expanding this important work.

This post presents an overview of what you can do with the API, now called the Player API, and some background information about how it came to exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to shipping the Connect Web API, Spotify offered a public interface that allowed developers to connect to Spotify’s Mac desktop application from another app running on Mac OS X. Through AppleScript, third-party developers could start or stop the music that was playing from Spotify’s Mac app and observe the title of the track that was playing. Developers used this opportunity to extend the Spotify experience into a variety of creative apps for their own personal use, for friends, and for other Spotify users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spotify Connect Web API extended these innovations to the web, and it now allows developers to control Spotify playback from any internet-connected device or app. The Player API has been used by thousands of developers to make third-party apps for home automation, social listening, music discovery, and much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, we enhanced the Player API further with the launch of our \u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eWeb Playback SDK\u003c/a\u003e: a JavaScript SDK that enables developers to create and control a fully functional player in the browser. When paired with the Player API, our Web Playback SDK can be used to build a frontend application that contains a fully functional web player for Spotify Premium users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn 2020, the Player API was further improved by the addition of an add-to-queue API — a new endpoint that developers can use to add tracks to the list of songs or podcast episodes that are playing next. We’re excited about what’s in store for the future of the Player API, and about the apps that developers are making with its functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat can I do with it?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eIssue commands\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt its core, the Player API empowers your web application to tell Spotify what audio to play and where and how to play it. In order to make commands, your app will need an OAuth access token authorized with the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/#user-modify-playback-state\"\u003euser-modify-playback-state OAuth scope\u003c/a\u003e. After your app has been granted a token with this permission by a user, your app can use that token to send commands to the Spotify Web API from any device connected to the internet. Note that most commands will only work for users who have a Spotify Premium subscription.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eStarting playback\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePUT https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/play\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe namesake feature of our Player API is the \u003ccode\u003e/v1/me/player/play\u003c/code\u003e endpoint — your tool for beginning or continuing the playback of music or podcasts on Spotify. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s more powerful than the play button that you see in Spotify’s mobile app. When you make a request to the /v1/me/player/play  endpoint, your third-party app can specify tracks by ID, or pass a \u003cstrong\u003econtext\u003c/strong\u003e that you’d like to play. Contexts can be a playlist, an album, or a collection, like your Liked Songs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also tell Spotify which \u003cstrong\u003edevice\u003c/strong\u003e you’d like to listen to by providing Spotify with a device identifier. The device can refer to a Web Playback SDK app, a running instance of a Spotify app, or one of your Spotify Connect-enabled speakers. You can find the device identifiers that are available to control through our Devices API. Note that some devices are not supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you use the play endpoint, you can also tell Spotify how loud the music should be — a score from 0 to 100 — and you can also ask Spotify to offset playback by one or more playlist items. This could be useful if you want to start playback from the third song in a playlist, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eStopping playback\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePUT https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/pause\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis endpoint is simple: it stops the audio that’s currently playing. After pausing playback with the pause endpoint, you can start it again by sending a request to \u003ccode\u003e/v1/me/player/play\u003c/code\u003e without any options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eTurning up (or down) the volume\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePUT https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/volume\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis command sets the volume between 0 and 100. Some apps use it to add a volume slider or switch into their user interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eAdding songs to the queue\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePUT https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/queue\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use the Player API to add songs or podcast episodes to the “Up next” queue in your Spotify app. Use this endpoint carefully — there is no API yet for removing tracks from the queue, or for reading the contents of the queue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eAudio seeking\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePUT https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/seek\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour app can use the seek endpoint to move the audio cursor to a given millisecond of the track or podcast episode that is currently playing. After the command is executed, Spotify will begin playback from that point in the song or episode. Some apps — like those using the Web Playback SDK — might use this endpoint to build an audio scrubbing interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eObserve state\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIssuing playback commands to Spotify would be hard without the ability to observe the state of the player and Connect environment. Luckily, the Player API includes methods you can use to do just that. You can find some of the more popular observation endpoints below. Calling these endpoints requires a token that’s been authorized with the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/#user-read-playback-state\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003euser-read-playback-state OAuth scope. \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eList devices\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eGET https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/devices\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use the devices API endpoint to fetch a list of active devices that you can target with playback commands. The list will include any open Web Playback SDK apps, many online Spotify Connect speakers, and Spotify-built apps that you may have open, like the \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com\"\u003eweb player\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSee what’s playing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eGET https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaking a GET request to the player endpoint will provide you with basic information about the currently playing context, the device that’s streaming, and other information about the playback state like whether or not shuffle is enabled and if the songs will repeat or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat you can build with the Player API\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eParty apps and social listening experiences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMusic fans commonly use Spotify Connect on social occasions to listen to music with friends and family. You can use the Player APIs to build an app that helps with your next house party or backyard barbeque. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the Player API allows you to fetch information about the currently playing track. Your app can combine this information with the\u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e Audio Features API\u003c/a\u003e to learn about the estimated danceability or tempo of the currently playing song, and integrate this information with a programmable lighting system to match the mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDevelopers can also combine the Player APIs with our \u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eWeb Playback SDK\u003c/a\u003e to make a virtual “listening party” experience. By tracking the current point in the song and using the seek API endpoint when necessary, your app can allow groups of Spotify users to log into a web app, listen to music at the same time and share control over which songs will be played next. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eHome automation integrations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany home automation systems are extensible or open source. Developers can use the Player APIs to connect Spotify with smart home systems and make audio a part of their routine. For example, you could use the \u003ccode\u003e/v1/me/player/play\u003c/code\u003e endpoint to begin streaming your favorite morning podcast at the same time as a programmable coffee machine starts to brew coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGetting started\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith some programming knowledge, any Spotify Premium user can set up a Player API app or develop one for their own use. You can connect with other developers who are using the API in the \u003ca href=\"https://community.spotify.com/t5/Spotify-for-Developers/bd-p/Spotify_Developer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify for Developers forum\u003c/a\u003e, or find examples of third-party apps in the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/community/showcase/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDeveloper Showcase\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe hope you get creative with it and make inventions that add to the Spotify experience for yourself or for your friends.

This post presents an overview of what you can do with the API, now called the Player API, and some background information about how it came to exist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to shipping the Connect Web API, Spotify offered a public interface that allowed developers to connect to Spotify’s Mac desktop application from another app running on Mac OS X. Through AppleScript, third-party developers could start or stop the music that was playing from Spotify’s Mac app and observe the title of the track that was playing. Developers used this opportunity to extend the Spotify experience into a variety of creative apps for their own personal use, for friends, and for other Spotify users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spotify Connect Web API extended these innovations to the web, and it now allows developers to control Spotify playback from any internet-connected device or app. The Player API has been used by thousands of developers to make third-party apps for home automation, social listening, music discovery, and much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, we enhanced the Player API further with the launch of our \u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eWeb Playback SDK\u003c/a\u003e: a JavaScript SDK that enables developers to create and control a fully functional player in the browser. When paired with the Player API, our Web Playback SDK can be used to build a frontend application that contains a fully functional web player for Spotify Premium users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIn 2020, the Player API was further improved by the addition of an add-to-queue API — a new endpoint that developers can use to add tracks to the list of songs or podcast episodes that are playing next. We’re excited about what’s in store for the future of the Player API, and about the apps that developers are making with its functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat can I do with it?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eIssue commands\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt its core, the Player API empowers your web application to tell Spotify what audio to play and where and how to play it. In order to make commands, your app will need an OAuth access token authorized with the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/#user-modify-playback-state\"\u003euser-modify-playback-state OAuth scope\u003c/a\u003e. After your app has been granted a token with this permission by a user, your app can use that token to send commands to the Spotify Web API from any device connected to the internet. Note that most commands will only work for users who have a Spotify Premium subscription.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eStarting playback\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePUT https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/play\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe namesake feature of our Player API is the \u003ccode\u003e/v1/me/player/play\u003c/code\u003e endpoint — your tool for beginning or continuing the playback of music or podcasts on Spotify. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s more powerful than the play button that you see in Spotify’s mobile app. When you make a request to the /v1/me/player/play  endpoint, your third-party app can specify tracks by ID, or pass a \u003cstrong\u003econtext\u003c/strong\u003e that you’d like to play. Contexts can be a playlist, an album, or a collection, like your Liked Songs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also tell Spotify which \u003cstrong\u003edevice\u003c/strong\u003e you’d like to listen to by providing Spotify with a device identifier. The device can refer to a Web Playback SDK app, a running instance of a Spotify app, or one of your Spotify Connect-enabled speakers. You can find the device identifiers that are available to control through our Devices API. Note that some devices are not supported.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you use the play endpoint, you can also tell Spotify how loud the music should be — a score from 0 to 100 — and you can also ask Spotify to offset playback by one or more playlist items. This could be useful if you want to start playback from the third song in a playlist, for example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eStopping playback\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePUT https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/pause\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis endpoint is simple: it stops the audio that’s currently playing. After pausing playback with the pause endpoint, you can start it again by sending a request to \u003ccode\u003e/v1/me/player/play\u003c/code\u003e without any options.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eTurning up (or down) the volume\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePUT https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/volume\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis command sets the volume between 0 and 100. Some apps use it to add a volume slider or switch into their user interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eAdding songs to the queue\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePUT https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/queue\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use the Player API to add songs or podcast episodes to the “Up next” queue in your Spotify app. Use this endpoint carefully — there is no API yet for removing tracks from the queue, or for reading the contents of the queue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eAudio seeking\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003ePUT https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/seek\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYour app can use the seek endpoint to move the audio cursor to a given millisecond of the track or podcast episode that is currently playing. After the command is executed, Spotify will begin playback from that point in the song or episode. Some apps — like those using the Web Playback SDK — might use this endpoint to build an audio scrubbing interface.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eObserve state\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIssuing playback commands to Spotify would be hard without the ability to observe the state of the player and Connect environment. Luckily, the Player API includes methods you can use to do just that. You can find some of the more popular observation endpoints below. Calling these endpoints requires a token that’s been authorized with the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/scopes/#user-read-playback-state\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003euser-read-playback-state OAuth scope. \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eList devices\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eGET https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player/devices\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can use the devices API endpoint to fetch a list of active devices that you can target with playback commands. The list will include any open Web Playback SDK apps, many online Spotify Connect speakers, and Spotify-built apps that you may have open, like the \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com\"\u003eweb player\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSee what’s playing\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eGET https://api.spotify.com/v1/me/player\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMaking a GET request to the player endpoint will provide you with basic information about the currently playing context, the device that’s streaming, and other information about the playback state like whether or not shuffle is enabled and if the songs will repeat or not.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat you can build with the Player API\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eParty apps and social listening experiences\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMusic fans commonly use Spotify Connect on social occasions to listen to music with friends and family. You can use the Player APIs to build an app that helps with your next house party or backyard barbeque. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, the Player API allows you to fetch information about the currently playing track. Your app can combine this information with the\u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e Audio Features API\u003c/a\u003e to learn about the estimated danceability or tempo of the currently playing song, and integrate this information with a programmable lighting system to match the mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDevelopers can also combine the Player APIs with our \u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eWeb Playback SDK\u003c/a\u003e to make a virtual “listening party” experience. By tracking the current point in the song and using the seek API endpoint when necessary, your app can allow groups of Spotify users to log into a web app, listen to music at the same time and share control over which songs will be played next. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eHome automation integrations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMany home automation systems are extensible or open source. Developers can use the Player APIs to connect Spotify with smart home systems and make audio a part of their routine. For example, you could use the \u003ccode\u003e/v1/me/player/play\u003c/code\u003e endpoint to begin streaming your favorite morning podcast at the same time as a programmable coffee machine starts to brew coffee.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGetting started\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith some programming knowledge, any Spotify Premium user can set up a Player API app or develop one for their own use.

At Spotify, we can now easily calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for difference-in-quantiles in A/B tests with hundreds of millions of observations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy are quantiles relevant for product development?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn product development, the most common impact analysis of product changes is often summarized by the change in the average of some metric of interest. This is a natural measurement, since changes in an average, in many contexts, map more or less directly to changes in business value. In addition, averages have convenient mathematical properties that make it straightforward to quantify uncertainty in over-served changes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a product development team to understand the impact of their work and be able to make strategic decisions, averages are not always sufficient. It is often of interest to understand how users with different behaviors are reacting to product changes. For example, a change in app load time often has the biggest impact on users with the slowest devices. Another example is app engagement — if our goal is to increase app engagement, it is often of interest to see if the engagement of the least engaged users increased, or if it was only users that were already highly engaged that increased their engagement more. For this purpose, quantiles and changes in quantiles, i.e., difference-in-quantiles due to product changes, is a powerful complement to the average. However, quantiles have less neat mathematical properties, which makes it less straightforward to quantify the uncertainty in observed changes in quantiles analytically. One robust method for quantile inference is bootstrap.     \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is (Poisson) bootstrap inference?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBootstrap inference\u003c/a\u003e is an ingenious resampling-based strategy for non-parametrically estimating the sampling distribution of any statistic using only the observed sample at hand. Bootstrap was originally proposed by the statistical legend Bradley Efron (Efron, 1979). Since the original paper, many extensions of the original idea have been developed, and their properties studied under various conditions for various test statistics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStandard statistical inference describes how an estimator, such as the sample mean, would behave if the experiment that produced the observed data were to be repeated over and over again. For many simple estimators, like the sample mean, what the behavior is like when the experiment is repeated can be described mathematically, and inference can easily be made. However, for some statistics like quantiles or ratios of means, it is often not possible to describe the sampling distribution analytically. In these situations, the bootstrap is a powerful tool. The idea of the bootstrap is almost painfully simple as it uses the same idea of repeating the experiment, but without having to mathematically derive what will happen. Simply put, instead of viewing the observed data as a sample from a population, bootstrap views the sample as the population. The ingenuity of this framing is that in order to describe the behavior of an estimator, we just need to take samples from our (pseudo)population — our experimental sample. Bootstrapping thus simply amounts to resampling observations from the observed sample with replacement, recording the estimate, and repeating this procedure. The collection of estimates describes the sampling distribution of the estimator from which inference can be made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo fully appreciate the idea, let’s assume we have observed a sample consisting of five observations: 4, 8, 11, 13, 15. To use bootstrap inference, we randomly draw five observations from our sample with replacement. Table 1 shows the results from 10 bootstrap replications. In the first resample, we obtain the observations 11, 11, 13, 13, 15. The sample median in this bootstrap sample is 13, which we record. Repeating this resampling step a large number of times provides us with a characterization of the sample median’s sampling distribution through the array of bootstrap sample medians found at the bottom of Table 1. The table shows results from 10 resamples, but in practice the number of resamples is usually in the thousands. A (1-alpha)100% level confidence interval can be computed by finding the alpha/2 and (1-alpha/2) quantiles of the bootstrap sample medians. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTable 1: Example of bootstrap distribution of the sample median for a sample of 5 units over 10 bootstrap samples. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"627\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Table-1.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Table-1.png 627w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Table-1-250x99.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Table-1-120x47.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe validity of bootstrap is well studied for a large class of statistics. See, for example, Ghosh et al. (1984) and Falk and Reiss (1989) for details regarding quantiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eComputational challenge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe computationally intensive nature of bootstrap caused by repeated resampling has made the primary use case small-sample experiments. For big data experiments, like A/B tests in the tech industry with millions and even hundreds of millions of users, bootstrap inference was for many years intractable unless only a fraction of the total number of observations was considered. Recently, Poisson bootstrap (Hanley and MacGibbon 2006, Chamandy et al. 2012) has gained traction as a computationally efficient way of approximating the original bootstrap’s sampling with replacement with big data, at least for linear estimators such as means. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe computational challenge of bootstrap inference is obvious. The Poisson bootstrap was proposed not because it is less computationally complex but because it is easier to implement in a scalable fashion for some estimators. For example, Chamandy et al. showed how Poisson bootstrap inference can be implemented with map-reduce (Dean and Ghemawat, 2008). Another approach that enables fast implementations of quantile bootstrap is the so-called “Little bag of bootstrap” (Kleiner et al., 2014). This approach also utilizes Poisson bootstrap, but the computational challenge is handled by splitting the full sample problem into smaller samples, performing calculations and then combining the results to yield the full sample results. Most tech companies have avoided bootstrap inference for quantiles altogether, and are instead relying on parametric approximations with analytical solutions. An exception includes bootstrapping based on compressed data, as described for example in the Netflix blog posts on \u003ca href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/streaming-video-experimentation-at-netflix-visualizing-practical-and-statistical-significance-7117420f4e9a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003epractical significance\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/data-compression-for-large-scale-streaming-experimentation-c20bfab8b9ce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003edata compression\u003c/a\u003e. Most approximations are based on the normal distribution, see for example \u003ca href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/how-wish-a-b-tests-percentiles-35ee3e4589e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethis blog post\u003c/a\u003e that uses results from Liu et al. (2019). However, as for any parametric test, the robustness of such approximations is highly dependent on the data-generating process.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, as we will discuss in the next section, there are other properties of the Poisson sampling and the quantile estimators themselves that can be used to reduce the complexity of the bootstrap algorithm to the extent that it will almost always be possible to perform bootstrap inference for quantiles and difference-in-quantiles without complex implementations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOur new algorithm: Bootstrapping without resampling\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand our proposed algorithm, one must understand the class of quantile estimators we are studying. There are many ways to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile#Estimating_quantiles_from_a_sample\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eestimate a sample quantile\u003c/a\u003e; most include some form of weighting of the closest order statistics. We propose to use a slightly more crude estimator. Let the quantile of interest be q and the sample size be N. If (N+1)q is an integer, the corresponding order statistic is our estimator. If (N+1)q is not an integer, we randomly select between the two neighboring integers. For example, assume we are interested in the median, and N=101. Then the 51st observation in the ordered list of observations is our median estimate. If N=100, then (N+1)q=50.5, and either the 50th or the 51st observation is, with equal probability, our median estimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur big realization was that to enable a faster algorithm, the only thing we need in order to estimate the bootstrap sample quantile is to know what index from the original sample becomes the bootstrap sample quantile in each Poisson-generated sample. The naive (and computationally complex) way of doing this is to repeat each observation in the original sample Poi(1) number of times, and check which observation had the ordered index that corresponded to the quantile. Our proposal is to instead study the distribution of the index in the original sample that is recorded as the quantile of interest in the bootstrapped sample. If you look at Table 1 again, you can see that the indexes of the ordered observations that wound up as the bootstrap-sample medians are 4,3,2,3,1,5,3,2,2,4. That is, the value 4 (ordered index 1), was only median in one bootstrap sample. The value 8 (ordered index 2) was median in three bootstrap samples, the value 11 (ordered index 3) was median in 3 samples, etc. Naturally, the closer the index is to that of the original sample median, the more frequently the value becomes the bootstrap sample median. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s look closer at the distribution of ordered indexes selected across repeated bootstrap samples. We consider a sample of size N=200, and suppose that we are interested in the 20th percentile, that is q=0.2. Figure 1 displays the frequencies at which indexes of observations in the ordered original sample were recorded as the 20th percentile in 1M Poisson bootstrap samples. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFigure 1: Frequencies at which indexes of observations in the ordered original sample were recorded as the 20th percentile in 1M Poisson bootstrap samples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"700\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-700x438.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-700x438.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-250x156.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-768x480.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-1536x960.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-120x75.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two important learnings from this figure. First, most ordered indexes between 1 and 200 are never found to be the bootstrap sample quantile. This is of course expected, but it means that we are generating Poisson values (resampling) for many order statistics that will never have a chance to be the sample quantile. The second learning is far more important — the distribution highly resembles a binomial distribution. It turns out that the distribution of ordered indexes in the original sample of size N that are recorded as the qth sample quantile in Poisson-generated bootstrap samples is very well approximated by a Bin(N+1,q) distribution for large N.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the difference-in-quantile confidence intervals, the implications from this result are profound. Computationally, it means that for a difference-in-quantiles bootstrap confidence interval we can sort the outcomes once, and then sample indexes and use the corresponding ordered observations as bootstrap estimates for the quantile. If you are interested in the details regarding the reduction in complexity, see our paper \u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10992.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSchultzberg and Ankargren (2022)\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, for one-sample quantile bootstrap confidence intervals, our result is rediscovering the well known order-statistic based confidence intervals for quantiles, see for example Gibbons and Chakraborti (2010), but derived from the bootstrap approach. The important difference is that we are not only interested in the confidence intervals themselves, but the distribution of indexes. Ultimately, this is what enables us to do two-sample comparisons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Python code block below illustrates how simple it is to calculate a bootstrap confidence interval for a sample quantile estimator using the binomial approximation of the index distribution.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import binom\n\nalpha=.05\nquantile_of_interest=0.5\nsample_size=10000\nnumber_of_bootstrap_samples=1000000\noutcome_sorted = np.sort(np.random.normal(1,1,sample_size))\n\nci_indexes = binom.ppf([alpha/2,1-alpha/2],sample_size+1, quantile_of_interest)\nbootstrap_confidence_interval = outcome_sorted[[int(np.floor(ci_indexes[0])), int(np.ceil(ci_indexes[1]))]]\n\nf\u0026#34;The sample median is {np.quantile(outcome_sorted, quantile_of_interest)}, the {(1-alpha)*100}%\\\nconfidence interval is given by ({bootstrap_confidence_interval}).\u0026#34;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the one-sample case, the complexity consists of a single sort of the original outcome data (actually this can be simplified even further). This follows since we already know which order statistics will be boundaries for the alpha/2 and 1-alpha/2 tails of the binomial distribution of indexes that will become the quantile of interest in the distribution of bootstrap estimates. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the two-sample case, which is our main contribution, we still need to calculate the difference between the two sample quantiles in each bootstrap iteration.

At Spotify, we can now easily calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for difference-in-quantiles in A/B tests with hundreds of millions of observations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy are quantiles relevant for product development?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn product development, the most common impact analysis of product changes is often summarized by the change in the average of some metric of interest. This is a natural measurement, since changes in an average, in many contexts, map more or less directly to changes in business value. In addition, averages have convenient mathematical properties that make it straightforward to quantify uncertainty in over-served changes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a product development team to understand the impact of their work and be able to make strategic decisions, averages are not always sufficient. It is often of interest to understand how users with different behaviors are reacting to product changes. For example, a change in app load time often has the biggest impact on users with the slowest devices. Another example is app engagement — if our goal is to increase app engagement, it is often of interest to see if the engagement of the least engaged users increased, or if it was only users that were already highly engaged that increased their engagement more. For this purpose, quantiles and changes in quantiles, i.e., difference-in-quantiles due to product changes, is a powerful complement to the average. However, quantiles have less neat mathematical properties, which makes it less straightforward to quantify the uncertainty in observed changes in quantiles analytically. One robust method for quantile inference is bootstrap.     \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is (Poisson) bootstrap inference?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(statistics)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBootstrap inference\u003c/a\u003e is an ingenious resampling-based strategy for non-parametrically estimating the sampling distribution of any statistic using only the observed sample at hand. Bootstrap was originally proposed by the statistical legend Bradley Efron (Efron, 1979). Since the original paper, many extensions of the original idea have been developed, and their properties studied under various conditions for various test statistics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStandard statistical inference describes how an estimator, such as the sample mean, would behave if the experiment that produced the observed data were to be repeated over and over again. For many simple estimators, like the sample mean, what the behavior is like when the experiment is repeated can be described mathematically, and inference can easily be made. However, for some statistics like quantiles or ratios of means, it is often not possible to describe the sampling distribution analytically. In these situations, the bootstrap is a powerful tool. The idea of the bootstrap is almost painfully simple as it uses the same idea of repeating the experiment, but without having to mathematically derive what will happen. Simply put, instead of viewing the observed data as a sample from a population, bootstrap views the sample as the population. The ingenuity of this framing is that in order to describe the behavior of an estimator, we just need to take samples from our (pseudo)population — our experimental sample. Bootstrapping thus simply amounts to resampling observations from the observed sample with replacement, recording the estimate, and repeating this procedure. The collection of estimates describes the sampling distribution of the estimator from which inference can be made.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo fully appreciate the idea, let’s assume we have observed a sample consisting of five observations: 4, 8, 11, 13, 15. To use bootstrap inference, we randomly draw five observations from our sample with replacement. Table 1 shows the results from 10 bootstrap replications. In the first resample, we obtain the observations 11, 11, 13, 13, 15. The sample median in this bootstrap sample is 13, which we record. Repeating this resampling step a large number of times provides us with a characterization of the sample median’s sampling distribution through the array of bootstrap sample medians found at the bottom of Table 1. The table shows results from 10 resamples, but in practice the number of resamples is usually in the thousands. A (1-alpha)100% level confidence interval can be computed by finding the alpha/2 and (1-alpha/2) quantiles of the bootstrap sample medians. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTable 1: Example of bootstrap distribution of the sample median for a sample of 5 units over 10 bootstrap samples. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"627\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Table-1.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Table-1.png 627w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Table-1-250x99.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Table-1-120x47.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 627px) 100vw, 627px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe validity of bootstrap is well studied for a large class of statistics. See, for example, Ghosh et al. (1984) and Falk and Reiss (1989) for details regarding quantiles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eComputational challenge\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe computationally intensive nature of bootstrap caused by repeated resampling has made the primary use case small-sample experiments. For big data experiments, like A/B tests in the tech industry with millions and even hundreds of millions of users, bootstrap inference was for many years intractable unless only a fraction of the total number of observations was considered. Recently, Poisson bootstrap (Hanley and MacGibbon 2006, Chamandy et al. 2012) has gained traction as a computationally efficient way of approximating the original bootstrap’s sampling with replacement with big data, at least for linear estimators such as means. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe computational challenge of bootstrap inference is obvious. The Poisson bootstrap was proposed not because it is less computationally complex but because it is easier to implement in a scalable fashion for some estimators. For example, Chamandy et al. showed how Poisson bootstrap inference can be implemented with map-reduce (Dean and Ghemawat, 2008). Another approach that enables fast implementations of quantile bootstrap is the so-called “Little bag of bootstrap” (Kleiner et al., 2014). This approach also utilizes Poisson bootstrap, but the computational challenge is handled by splitting the full sample problem into smaller samples, performing calculations and then combining the results to yield the full sample results. Most tech companies have avoided bootstrap inference for quantiles altogether, and are instead relying on parametric approximations with analytical solutions. An exception includes bootstrapping based on compressed data, as described for example in the Netflix blog posts on \u003ca href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/streaming-video-experimentation-at-netflix-visualizing-practical-and-statistical-significance-7117420f4e9a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003epractical significance\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://netflixtechblog.com/data-compression-for-large-scale-streaming-experimentation-c20bfab8b9ce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003edata compression\u003c/a\u003e. Most approximations are based on the normal distribution, see for example \u003ca href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/how-wish-a-b-tests-percentiles-35ee3e4589e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethis blog post\u003c/a\u003e that uses results from Liu et al. (2019). However, as for any parametric test, the robustness of such approximations is highly dependent on the data-generating process.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, as we will discuss in the next section, there are other properties of the Poisson sampling and the quantile estimators themselves that can be used to reduce the complexity of the bootstrap algorithm to the extent that it will almost always be possible to perform bootstrap inference for quantiles and difference-in-quantiles without complex implementations. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOur new algorithm: Bootstrapping without resampling\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo understand our proposed algorithm, one must understand the class of quantile estimators we are studying. There are many ways to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile#Estimating_quantiles_from_a_sample\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eestimate a sample quantile\u003c/a\u003e; most include some form of weighting of the closest order statistics. We propose to use a slightly more crude estimator. Let the quantile of interest be q and the sample size be N. If (N+1)q is an integer, the corresponding order statistic is our estimator. If (N+1)q is not an integer, we randomly select between the two neighboring integers. For example, assume we are interested in the median, and N=101. Then the 51st observation in the ordered list of observations is our median estimate. If N=100, then (N+1)q=50.5, and either the 50th or the 51st observation is, with equal probability, our median estimate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur big realization was that to enable a faster algorithm, the only thing we need in order to estimate the bootstrap sample quantile is to know what index from the original sample becomes the bootstrap sample quantile in each Poisson-generated sample. The naive (and computationally complex) way of doing this is to repeat each observation in the original sample Poi(1) number of times, and check which observation had the ordered index that corresponded to the quantile. Our proposal is to instead study the distribution of the index in the original sample that is recorded as the quantile of interest in the bootstrapped sample. If you look at Table 1 again, you can see that the indexes of the ordered observations that wound up as the bootstrap-sample medians are 4,3,2,3,1,5,3,2,2,4. That is, the value 4 (ordered index 1), was only median in one bootstrap sample. The value 8 (ordered index 2) was median in three bootstrap samples, the value 11 (ordered index 3) was median in 3 samples, etc. Naturally, the closer the index is to that of the original sample median, the more frequently the value becomes the bootstrap sample median. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s look closer at the distribution of ordered indexes selected across repeated bootstrap samples. We consider a sample of size N=200, and suppose that we are interested in the 20th percentile, that is q=0.2. Figure 1 displays the frequencies at which indexes of observations in the ordered original sample were recorded as the 20th percentile in 1M Poisson bootstrap samples. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFigure 1: Frequencies at which indexes of observations in the ordered original sample were recorded as the 20th percentile in 1M Poisson bootstrap samples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"438\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-700x438.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-700x438.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-250x156.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-768x480.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-1536x960.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes-120x75.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/03/Bootstrapped-Distributon-of-Quantile-Indexes.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are two important learnings from this figure. First, most ordered indexes between 1 and 200 are never found to be the bootstrap sample quantile. This is of course expected, but it means that we are generating Poisson values (resampling) for many order statistics that will never have a chance to be the sample quantile. The second learning is far more important — the distribution highly resembles a binomial distribution. It turns out that the distribution of ordered indexes in the original sample of size N that are recorded as the qth sample quantile in Poisson-generated bootstrap samples is very well approximated by a Bin(N+1,q) distribution for large N.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the difference-in-quantile confidence intervals, the implications from this result are profound. Computationally, it means that for a difference-in-quantiles bootstrap confidence interval we can sort the outcomes once, and then sample indexes and use the corresponding ordered observations as bootstrap estimates for the quantile. If you are interested in the details regarding the reduction in complexity, see our paper \u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.10992.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSchultzberg and Ankargren (2022)\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterestingly, for one-sample quantile bootstrap confidence intervals, our result is rediscovering the well known order-statistic based confidence intervals for quantiles, see for example Gibbons and Chakraborti (2010), but derived from the bootstrap approach. The important difference is that we are not only interested in the confidence intervals themselves, but the distribution of indexes. Ultimately, this is what enables us to do two-sample comparisons.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Python code block below illustrates how simple it is to calculate a bootstrap confidence interval for a sample quantile estimator using the binomial approximation of the index distribution.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import binom\n\nalpha=.05\nquantile_of_interest=0.5\nsample_size=10000\nnumber_of_bootstrap_samples=1000000\noutcome_sorted = np.sort(np.random.normal(1,1,sample_size))\n\nci_indexes = binom.ppf([alpha/2,1-alpha/2],sample_size+1, quantile_of_interest)\nbootstrap_confidence_interval = outcome_sorted[[int(np.floor(ci_indexes[0])), int(np.ceil(ci_indexes[1]))]]\n\nf\u0026#34;The sample median is {np.quantile(outcome_sorted, quantile_of_interest)}, the {(1-alpha)*100}%\\\nconfidence interval is given by ({bootstrap_confidence_interval}).\u0026#34;\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the one-sample case, the complexity consists of a single sort of the original outcome data (actually this can be simplified even further).

But the energy was amazing and I really had fun.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat were the biggest challenges? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most challenging things was being an engineer in a room full of people from different disciplines – I had to manage stakeholders’ expectations, express my perspective and be confident enough to say what was and wasn’t possible. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor instance, there were these curves – or ribbons, as we called them – that were a signature of the Wrapped campaign design. At first, we were trying to animate text within them, but it was all distorting. And so, it was my job to say “this isn’t working, this isn’t technically feasible” and help come up with a cool alternative solution. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the most inspiring moment? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was inspiring to see my friends – and even my parents! – enjoy something that I’d had a hand in. We created this big dashboard that showed when we were trending on Twitter – I loved knowing we were shaping internet culture and having the opportunity to learn from it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd then, of course, there were the numbers! The number of people who engaged with the experience gave me chills – we really blew our goal out of the water.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat made it a fun project to be part of? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWorking on Wrapped was intense, but in the most fun way possible! I loved all the exploration and discovery involved – for instance, the audio auras in the user experience were new for this year, so I got to spend a few days playing around with code, experimenting and figuring out how they could work. There was a real start-up energy that’s unusual in such a large company and everything felt very dynamic and fast-paced. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI also enjoyed working with our embeds from across the country and getting to know them better.

For example, if you type the query “electric cars climate impact”, Elasticsearch will return search results that contain everything that has each of those query words in its indexed metadata (like in the title of a podcast episode).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, we know users don’t always type the exact words for what they want to listen to, and we have to use fuzzy matching, normalization, and even manual aliases to make up for it. While these techniques are very helpful for the user, they have limitations, as they cannot capture all variations of expressing yourself in natural language, especially when using natural language sentences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGoing back to the query “electric cars climate impact”, our Elasticsearch cluster did not actually retrieve anything for it… but does this mean that we don’t have any relevant content to show to the user for this query? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnter \u003cem\u003eNatural Language Search\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eNatural Language Search\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo enable users to find more relevant content with less effort, we started investigating a technique called Natural Language Search, also known as\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eSemantic Search in the literature. In a nutshell, Natural Language Search matches a query and a textual document that are semantically correlated instead of needing exact word matches. It matches synonyms, paraphrases, etc., and any variation of natural language that express the same meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a first step, we decided to apply Natural Language Search to podcast episode retrieval, as we thought that semantic matching would be most useful when searching for podcasts. Our solution is now deployed for most Spotify users\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e Thanks to this technique, one can retrieve relevant content for our example query:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"700\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Natural-Search-Language-for-Podcast-Episodes-1-700x532.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Natural-Search-Language-for-Podcast-Episodes-1-700x532.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Natural-Search-Language-for-Podcast-Episodes-1-250x190.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Natural-Search-Language-for-Podcast-Episodes-1-768x584.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Natural-Search-Language-for-Podcast-Episodes-1-1536x1168.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Natural-Search-Language-for-Podcast-Episodes-1-120x91.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Natural-Search-Language-for-Podcast-Episodes-1.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eExample of Natural Language Search for podcast episodes.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is noticeable that none of the retrieved episodes contains all of the query words in their title (that’s why Elasticsearch was not picking them up). However, those episodes seem quite relevant to the user’s query.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo achieve this result, we leveraged recent advances in Deep Learning / Natural Language Processing (NLP) like \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-supervised_learning\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSelf-supervised learning\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eTransformer neural networks\u003c/a\u003e.

A vector is simply an array of float values. The objective is that the vectors of a search query and a relevant episode would be close together in the embedding space. For queries, we use the query text as input to the model, and for episodes, we use a concatenation of textual metadata fields of the episode such as its title, description, its parent podcast show’s title and description, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring live Search traffic, we can then employ sophisticated vector search techniques to efficiently retrieve the episodes whose vectors are the closest to the query vector.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"700\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Queries-and-Podcast-Episodes-700x532.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Queries-and-Podcast-Episodes-700x532.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Queries-and-Podcast-Episodes-250x190.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Queries-and-Podcast-Episodes-768x584.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Queries-and-Podcast-Episodes-1536x1167.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Queries-and-Podcast-Episodes-120x91.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Queries-and-Podcast-Episodes.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eShared embedding space for queries and podcast episodes.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003ePicking the right pre-trained Transformer model for our task\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTransformer models like \u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBERT\u003c/a\u003e are currently state-of-the-art on the vast majority of NLP tasks.

To that end, we preprocess different types of data:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFrom our past search logs, we take successful podcast searches and create (query, episode) pairs. Those successes mostly come from previous queries and their returned results through Elasticsearch.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAlso from our past search logs, we examined user sessions to find successful attempts at search queries after an initial search came up unsuccessful. We used those query reformulations to create (query_prior_to_successful_reformulation, episode) pairs.\u003cbr/\u003eWith this data source, we hope to capture in our training set more “semantic” (query, episode) pairs with no exact word matching between the query and the episode metadata.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo further extend and diversify our training set, we generate synthetic queries from popular episode titles and descriptions, inspired by the paper \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10270.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e“Embedding-based Zero-shot Retrieval through Query Generation”\u003c/a\u003e.

Moreover, when splitting the data, we make sure that the episodes in the evaluation set are not present in the training set (to be able to verify the generalization ability of our model to new content).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eTraining\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have our model and our data, so the next step is the training. We use the pre-trained Universal Sentence Encoder CMLM model as a starting point for both the query encoder and the episode encoder. After a few experiments, we chose a siamese network setting where the weights are shared between the two encoders. Cosine similarity is used as the similarity measure between a query vector and an episode vector. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"700\" height=\"532\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Model-Architecture-700x532.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Model-Architecture-700x532.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Model-Architecture-250x190.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Model-Architecture-768x584.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Model-Architecture-1536x1167.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Model-Architecture-120x91.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/03/Model-Architecture.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eModel architecture: bi-encoder Transformer in a siamese setting.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to effectively train our model, we need both positive (query, episode) pairs and negative ones.

Our main reason for using Vertex AI is its support for GPU inference, as large Transformer models like ours are usually more cost-effective when running on GPU even for inference (this was confirmed by our load test experiments with a 6x cost reduction factor between T4 GPU and CPU). Once the query vector is computed, it is used to retrieve from Vespa the top 30 “semantic podcast episodes” (using our previously described ANN Search).

All different tasks, libraries, and logic gets packaged into a Docker image, which is deployed as is to \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spotify/styx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eStyx\u003c/a\u003e with an entry point to the root task to run. Styx handles scheduling and execution, so when it is time, it will start the Docker image in our GKE cluster. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt runtime, the graph of dependencies is discovered and tasks are run in the defined order. In this stage, the workflow also sends lineage data if it is instrumented to do so. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe tasks might start a dataflow or BigQuery job and publish data to different locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eProblems we needed to solve\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLuigi and Flo are shipped as libraries that the users then consume. There are a few issues with this approach:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaintenance burden:\u003c/strong\u003e We need to implement, maintain, and update features on two different libraries offering the same capabilities.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport burden:\u003c/strong\u003e We need to push updates to all users, but users don’t always upgrade to the latest version. This makes it hard for us, as a platform team, to roll out fixes and new instrumentation to the entire fleet of 1,000+, and growing, repositories. Monitoring change adoption and managing the fragmented versioning impacts platform and productivity of data engineers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLack of insights:\u003c/strong\u003e The workflow container is a black box to the platform, and it is only possible to collect insights on task graphs, blocking upstreams only after an execution has taken place. This leads to considerable overhead wherein a portion of GKE cluster time is spent polling for missing dependencies.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, starting this journey, it was evident that there were a number of areas where we could bring (potentially significant) improvements by investing in our scheduling/orchestration offering. We believed, though, that not all of them would have the same impact on our users and our ability to operate in an impactful way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, our prioritized goals for the next-generation orchestration were, and still are, to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMake upgrades as frictionless as possible. \u003c/strong\u003eBy pushing as much functionality as possible down to the platform teams, it allows us platform teams to own more of the foundational parts. This makes it possible to add features and fixes automatically to all. In the platform mission, we are strong believers that we add value by making things easier. We want to limit the amount of time spent by users on the maintenance of our tool. This allows them to focus and excel in their core domain of expertise.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnable the development of platform automation functionality. \u003c/strong\u003eA few examples of automation requested by our users are: opt-in for downstream backfill triggering, various event-triggered actions, canceling workflow execution after a user-defined alert, notify downstream consumers in case of workflow failure/delay. To enable those features we need to have visibility on the tasks and workflows, which we currently don’t have with the Luigi/Flo setup running everything in a Docker image.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur vision on how to solve this has been to move away from the library/tool paradigm to build the orchestration logic into a service. More specifically, we proposed a new orchestration paradigm where:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOrchestration of tasks within a workflow is performed by a managed service.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBusiness logic (task code) is run in an environment controlled by the platform.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUsers define workflows and tasks using SDKs distributed by the platform teams.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eHow did we reach our preferred solution?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn our elimination process, we took into account the following factors:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEffort needed to migrate (or not) existing workflows\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDevelopment effort and time to market (a new in-house development vs. a ready-made product that we adapt and integrate into our ecosystem)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMaintenance burden (e.g., Google-managed vs. self-managed)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExtensibility of the solution\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAbility to inspect what is done within a workflow (explicit definition vs. Docker image)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMultiple language support\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe solution we found: Flyte\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are a number of options to perform workflow orchestration.

All different tasks, libraries, and logic gets packaged into a Docker image, which is deployed as is to \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spotify/styx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eStyx\u003c/a\u003e with an entry point to the root task to run. Styx handles scheduling and execution, so when it is time, it will start the Docker image in our GKE cluster. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt runtime, the graph of dependencies is discovered and tasks are run in the defined order. In this stage, the workflow also sends lineage data if it is instrumented to do so. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe tasks might start a dataflow or BigQuery job and publish data to different locations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eProblems we needed to solve\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLuigi and Flo are shipped as libraries that the users then consume. There are a few issues with this approach:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaintenance burden:\u003c/strong\u003e We need to implement, maintain, and update features on two different libraries offering the same capabilities.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport burden:\u003c/strong\u003e We need to push updates to all users, but users don’t always upgrade to the latest version. This makes it hard for us, as a platform team, to roll out fixes and new instrumentation to the entire fleet of 1,000+, and growing, repositories. Monitoring change adoption and managing the fragmented versioning impacts platform and productivity of data engineers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLack of insights:\u003c/strong\u003e The workflow container is a black box to the platform, and it is only possible to collect insights on task graphs, blocking upstreams only after an execution has taken place. This leads to considerable overhead wherein a portion of GKE cluster time is spent polling for missing dependencies.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, starting this journey, it was evident that there were a number of areas where we could bring (potentially significant) improvements by investing in our scheduling/orchestration offering. We believed, though, that not all of them would have the same impact on our users and our ability to operate in an impactful way. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat said, our prioritized goals for the next-generation orchestration were, and still are, to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMake upgrades as frictionless as possible. \u003c/strong\u003eBy pushing as much functionality as possible down to the platform teams, it allows us platform teams to own more of the foundational parts. This makes it possible to add features and fixes automatically to all. In the platform mission, we are strong believers that we add value by making things easier. We want to limit the amount of time spent by users on the maintenance of our tool. This allows them to focus and excel in their core domain of expertise.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnable the development of platform automation functionality. \u003c/strong\u003eA few examples of automation requested by our users are: opt-in for downstream backfill triggering, various event-triggered actions, canceling workflow execution after a user-defined alert, notify downstream consumers in case of workflow failure/delay. To enable those features we need to have visibility on the tasks and workflows, which we currently don’t have with the Luigi/Flo setup running everything in a Docker image.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur vision on how to solve this has been to move away from the library/tool paradigm to build the orchestration logic into a service.

The experimentation platform is already mature and offers most of the functionality and flexibility required — and the pace at which the experimentation platform improves is often faster than the rate of adopting new functionality by individual teams. In addition, a lot of documentation and best practices have been established for the platform’s functionalities, which help with the process of setting up tests. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the effort to adopt a truly data-informed product development process doesn’t stop there — it requires continuous effort and push. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eExperimentation practices and data-driven product development is often considered a data science topic — and that is true to some extent. Data scientists usually have a deeper understanding of statistics and experimentation, so they tend to be the most excited about adopting a data-driven product development culture. The Search team at Spotify consists of several engineering teams, an array of product managers, a product insights team with a number of data scientists, and a product area leads group. You’d probably guess that engineering teams have to be pretty independent from data scientists to avoid creating bottlenecks, and you’d be right. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDefining best practices for experimentation is made relatively easily thanks to hundreds of articles that explain how to do things like perform a power analysis, choose metrics, interpret a p-value, etc. It is, however, less easy to integrate those practices day to day and turn them into habits. This requires creating an environment where adapting ways of working to improve our experimentation culture feels empowering, rather than uncomfortable, in a diverse team with different disciplines and varying levels of knowledge. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead on to find out more about the two key drivers of our success and the concrete actions we took over the last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKey driver 1 – Roadmap\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to adopting a truly data-informed product development process, the road to the end goal can feel overwhelming both for the engineering team and for data scientists. It is crucial that the plan towards that goal takes into account the maturity, ability, and bandwidth of the teams. In large organizations, these aspects often vary a lot from team to team and across parts of the organization. Too much too soon will lead to people feeling overwhelmed and giving up; too little too seldom and the momentum and excitement will be lost. To make this balancing easier, we created a roadmap with three simple steps:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eIndividual experiment quality — Adopt quality standards for each experiment to meet\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCross-experiments quality — Coordinate individual experiments\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMeasure total business impact — Estimate the cumulative impact of all the features released in a quarter\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eStep 1 — Individual experiment quality \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor an experiment to bring the promised gold-standard value to a product decision, many things have to be in place: proper hypothesis, well-defined metrics to evaluate the hypothesis, decision rules set before the experiment starts, etc. These individual practices can be introduced to the teams gradually, making each one easy to integrate into the workflow. Combined, they raise each experiment to the gold-standard level. The main goal of Step 1 is to ensure that each experiment leads to a highly reliable data-informed product decision. Once the quality, and thereby the value, of each experiment starts to improve, the number of experiments will often also increase. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify Search, we continue to scale the speed of iteration in each team using experiments, and thus need to make each decision transparent and self-explanatory for anyone, e.g., new team members or those external to the team. For this reason, it is important to guide individual teams during Step 1 into using shared practices. Examples of such shared practices are using common conventions for naming experiments, writing hypotheses, and logging decisions after the experiment ends. We have applied this by having our Search data science team provide and advocate for simple templates for test specifications and experiment setups. These templates help remind each team member of important steps and considerations for each test while also streamlining the practices across teams. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eStep 2 — Cross-experiments quality\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother important aspect of experimentation at Spotify is coordination. Most of the time, teams have to run several experiments on top of each other, and some of these experiments must be coordinated in the sense that the same user cannot be in two experiments at the same time.  The Search team is no exception and coordinating experiments is a big part of our effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/03/10/spotifys-new-experimentation-coordination-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify’s experimentation platform\u003c/a\u003e has flexible coordination capabilities, so coordinating experiments at scale is possible, but it requires cross-team collaboration and alignment. The Search data science team helps experimenting teams find the right setup for the right experiment, and provides guidelines to avoid running out of users that are available to try our new search features. This effort is again helped by the Step 1 alignment, where template experiments have pre-selected coordination behaviors that nudge team members to select the appropriate setup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eStep 3 — Measure total business impact\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe final step of our plan to adopt a truly data-informed product development process is to measure the total impact of a product initiative over some relevant reporting time period, e.g., a quarter. The goal is to answer the question “What is the combined causal effect of all our product changes on our key metrics?” This can be done in several ways. A simple and naive total impact analysis is to sum the individual estimated causal effects from the experiments of all shipped product changes. At Spotify Search we use quarterly holdbacks to estimate the total impact of the product development program. This is achieved by holding a set of users back from all product changes during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we run one experiment on the users in the holdback, where one group is given no product change (control group), and one group is given all the shipped product changes (treatment group). This yields an unbiased estimator of the total causal effect of all product changes and directly answers the question posed above. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"700\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/Before-the-quarter-700x352.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/Before-the-quarter-700x352.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/Before-the-quarter-250x126.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/Before-the-quarter-768x386.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/Before-the-quarter-120x60.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/Before-the-quarter.png 1011w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 1: During the quarter\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg width=\"700\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/After-the-quarter-700x307.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/After-the-quarter-700x307.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/After-the-quarter-250x110.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/After-the-quarter-768x337.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/After-the-quarter-120x53.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/production-eng/1/2022/02/After-the-quarter.png 1011w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 2: After the quarter\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn important aspect of these steps is that they grow from within one team and spread across teams and within each individual experiment to across several experiments within the same initiative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not uncommon that experimentation initiatives in larger organizations are driven by the middle-level decision makers’ need for better total business impact estimates to guide future priorities. However, it is important to acknowledge that measuring the impact of a full product initiative with decent precision is not a trivial thing to achieve. This is especially challenging when product evaluation is not already a natural part of the product development culture. Our belief and experience is that the quickest way to achieve proper overall product evaluation is to build from the bottom up with solid product evaluation practices in each team. Moreover, we have found that each of these steps has brought a lot of value to our product development cycle beyond measuring impact, e.g., product quality awareness, better practices around product evaluation in general, knowledge sharing, and alignment across product teams. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKey driver 2 – Constant injection of energy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStarting the fire\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding great experimentation practices is like starting a fire with wet wood. It won’t start just because you provide a spark, but if you give it care and provide it with the right resources, the fire will eventually start and burn by itself. It’s the same for experimentation practices. You will need to start with a source of energy, pulling and pushing in the right direction, and you will need to continuously inject energy, for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdopting new practices that sometimes conflict with existing habits is a big challenge — it will take time and effort to convince teams of the value that experimentation brings to the product development process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur learnings reveal that at the beginning of the journey, a lot of things have to be boosted and done \u003cem\u003efor\u003c/em\u003e the engineering teams rather than \u003cem\u003eby\u003c/em\u003e them. By actually setting up and reviewing tests \u003cem\u003efor\u003c/em\u003e the teams, it allows them to see for themselves that the amount of work required on a day-to-day basis is manageable and, most importantly, the value those efforts bring to the team and product. Doing certain tasks for the teams will also deepen the trust between the experimentation advocate and the teams, reassuring engineers that they will get support along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the early experimenting stage of any team, it is critical to accept that some tests will not be perfect and some product decisions, therefore, not fully data informed. However, it is of the utmost importance that the teams get sufficient support to succeed with an experiment by continuously injecting support and energy, starting the fire and keeping it burning. In our experience, the key to the success of starting experimentation is endurance and continuity. The smallest lighter can make any wet wood burn with sufficient time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaintaining the fire\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eJust as we had to scale our practices between teams, we had to scale the injection of energy. The solution to scale presented itself in the form of individuals across Search teams who developed an interest and expertise in experimentation and became new precious sources of energy. As we progressed as a team towards more data-driven product development, the expertise and support gradually transferred from the advocating team to individual team members who naturally started to inject energy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn big and agile organizations, there are often organizational changes made to fit new needs, as well as new people joining, which makes it harder to keep practices aligned.

The experimentation platform is already mature and offers most of the functionality and flexibility required — and the pace at which the experimentation platform improves is often faster than the rate of adopting new functionality by individual teams. In addition, a lot of documentation and best practices have been established for the platform’s functionalities, which help with the process of setting up tests. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the effort to adopt a truly data-informed product development process doesn’t stop there — it requires continuous effort and push. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eExperimentation practices and data-driven product development is often considered a data science topic — and that is true to some extent. Data scientists usually have a deeper understanding of statistics and experimentation, so they tend to be the most excited about adopting a data-driven product development culture. The Search team at Spotify consists of several engineering teams, an array of product managers, a product insights team with a number of data scientists, and a product area leads group. You’d probably guess that engineering teams have to be pretty independent from data scientists to avoid creating bottlenecks, and you’d be right. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDefining best practices for experimentation is made relatively easily thanks to hundreds of articles that explain how to do things like perform a power analysis, choose metrics, interpret a p-value, etc. It is, however, less easy to integrate those practices day to day and turn them into habits. This requires creating an environment where adapting ways of working to improve our experimentation culture feels empowering, rather than uncomfortable, in a diverse team with different disciplines and varying levels of knowledge. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead on to find out more about the two key drivers of our success and the concrete actions we took over the last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKey driver 1 – Roadmap\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to adopting a truly data-informed product development process, the road to the end goal can feel overwhelming both for the engineering team and for data scientists. It is crucial that the plan towards that goal takes into account the maturity, ability, and bandwidth of the teams. In large organizations, these aspects often vary a lot from team to team and across parts of the organization. Too much too soon will lead to people feeling overwhelmed and giving up; too little too seldom and the momentum and excitement will be lost. To make this balancing easier, we created a roadmap with three simple steps:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eIndividual experiment quality — Adopt quality standards for each experiment to meet\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCross-experiments quality — Coordinate individual experiments\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMeasure total business impact — Estimate the cumulative impact of all the features released in a quarter\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eStep 1 — Individual experiment quality \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor an experiment to bring the promised gold-standard value to a product decision, many things have to be in place: proper hypothesis, well-defined metrics to evaluate the hypothesis, decision rules set before the experiment starts, etc. These individual practices can be introduced to the teams gradually, making each one easy to integrate into the workflow. Combined, they raise each experiment to the gold-standard level. The main goal of Step 1 is to ensure that each experiment leads to a highly reliable data-informed product decision. Once the quality, and thereby the value, of each experiment starts to improve, the number of experiments will often also increase. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify Search, we continue to scale the speed of iteration in each team using experiments, and thus need to make each decision transparent and self-explanatory for anyone, e.g., new team members or those external to the team. For this reason, it is important to guide individual teams during Step 1 into using shared practices. Examples of such shared practices are using common conventions for naming experiments, writing hypotheses, and logging decisions after the experiment ends. We have applied this by having our Search data science team provide and advocate for simple templates for test specifications and experiment setups. These templates help remind each team member of important steps and considerations for each test while also streamlining the practices across teams. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eStep 2 — Cross-experiments quality\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother important aspect of experimentation at Spotify is coordination. Most of the time, teams have to run several experiments on top of each other, and some of these experiments must be coordinated in the sense that the same user cannot be in two experiments at the same time.  The Search team is no exception and coordinating experiments is a big part of our effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2021/03/10/spotifys-new-experimentation-coordination-strategy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify’s experimentation platform\u003c/a\u003e has flexible coordination capabilities, so coordinating experiments at scale is possible, but it requires cross-team collaboration and alignment. The Search data science team helps experimenting teams find the right setup for the right experiment, and provides guidelines to avoid running out of users that are available to try our new search features. This effort is again helped by the Step 1 alignment, where template experiments have pre-selected coordination behaviors that nudge team members to select the appropriate setup.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eStep 3 — Measure total business impact\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe final step of our plan to adopt a truly data-informed product development process is to measure the total impact of a product initiative over some relevant reporting time period, e.g., a quarter. The goal is to answer the question “What is the combined causal effect of all our product changes on our key metrics?” This can be done in several ways. A simple and naive total impact analysis is to sum the individual estimated causal effects from the experiments of all shipped product changes. At Spotify Search we use quarterly holdbacks to estimate the total impact of the product development program. This is achieved by holding a set of users back from all product changes during the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we run one experiment on the users in the holdback, where one group is given no product change (control group), and one group is given all the shipped product changes (treatment group). This yields an unbiased estimator of the total causal effect of all product changes and directly answers the question posed above. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Before-the-quarter-700x352.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Before-the-quarter-700x352.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Before-the-quarter-250x126.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Before-the-quarter-768x386.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Before-the-quarter-120x60.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Before-the-quarter.png 1011w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 1: During the quarter\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"307\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/After-the-quarter-700x307.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/After-the-quarter-700x307.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/After-the-quarter-250x110.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/After-the-quarter-768x337.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/After-the-quarter-120x53.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/After-the-quarter.png 1011w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 2: After the quarter\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn important aspect of these steps is that they grow from within one team and spread across teams and within each individual experiment to across several experiments within the same initiative.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is not uncommon that experimentation initiatives in larger organizations are driven by the middle-level decision makers’ need for better total business impact estimates to guide future priorities. However, it is important to acknowledge that measuring the impact of a full product initiative with decent precision is not a trivial thing to achieve. This is especially challenging when product evaluation is not already a natural part of the product development culture. Our belief and experience is that the quickest way to achieve proper overall product evaluation is to build from the bottom up with solid product evaluation practices in each team. Moreover, we have found that each of these steps has brought a lot of value to our product development cycle beyond measuring impact, e.g., product quality awareness, better practices around product evaluation in general, knowledge sharing, and alignment across product teams. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eKey driver 2 – Constant injection of energy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStarting the fire\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding great experimentation practices is like starting a fire with wet wood. It won’t start just because you provide a spark, but if you give it care and provide it with the right resources, the fire will eventually start and burn by itself. It’s the same for experimentation practices. You will need to start with a source of energy, pulling and pushing in the right direction, and you will need to continuously inject energy, for a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdopting new practices that sometimes conflict with existing habits is a big challenge — it will take time and effort to convince teams of the value that experimentation brings to the product development process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur learnings reveal that at the beginning of the journey, a lot of things have to be boosted and done \u003cem\u003efor\u003c/em\u003e the engineering teams rather than \u003cem\u003eby\u003c/em\u003e them.

Doing certain tasks for the teams will also deepen the trust between the experimentation advocate and the teams, reassuring engineers that they will get support along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the early experimenting stage of any team, it is critical to accept that some tests will not be perfect and some product decisions, therefore, not fully data informed. However, it is of the utmost importance that the teams get sufficient support to succeed with an experiment by continuously injecting support and energy, starting the fire and keeping it burning. In our experience, the key to the success of starting experimentation is endurance and continuity. The smallest lighter can make any wet wood burn with sufficient time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaintaining the fire\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eJust as we had to scale our practices between teams, we had to scale the injection of energy. The solution to scale presented itself in the form of individuals across Search teams who developed an interest and expertise in experimentation and became new precious sources of energy. As we progressed as a team towards more data-driven product development, the expertise and support gradually transferred from the advocating team to individual team members who naturally started to inject energy. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn big and agile organizations, there are often organizational changes made to fit new needs, as well as new people joining, which makes it harder to keep practices aligned. So even if the fire burns by itself at some point, it is still crucial to have people dedicated to keep injecting energy, restarting and boosting the fire continuously. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSpotify Search in 2021\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have covered the major steps and principles that led Spotify Search on the journey to data-driven product development, we will look in more detail at the specific actions that were taken in Search last year.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"177\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Timeline-700x177.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Timeline-700x177.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Timeline-250x63.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Timeline-768x195.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Timeline-120x30.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Timeline.png 1404w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDecember 2020:\u003c/strong\u003e Unlock the use of all features from our experimentation platform (like sample size calculation or result page) by integrating our Search-specific metric into the system. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJanuary 2021: \u003c/strong\u003eCreation of a dedicated weekly forum and communication channel to make information flow better between the search engineering teams and data scientists.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMarch 2021:\u003c/strong\u003e Standardization of template for the test setup and test specification with pre-filled parameters.

Implementing these small steps over the course of just one year led to an impressive change in Search experimentation practices. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn 2022: keep the fire burning!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2021 we made great progress improving each experiment’s quality, improving coordination between experiments, and measuring global impact. This year in Search, we will take one more step toward truly building and improving our product in a data-informed way by integrating experimentation into a more global evaluation process for each initiative of our product development.

However, during the last year, I have seen many people from several disciplines stepping in and taking responsibility for the progress of our experimentation practices. It is now common to see engineers discussing if they should stop a product change from being launched to prevent a negative user experience. We have PMs on our team driving the education of PMs at Spotify globally on the topic of experimentation. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo me this evolution of behavior is proof that it is possible to improve our product evaluation process substantially by taking three simple measures: providing a safe environment for teams to evolve their practices, continuously injecting energy and support, and ensuring that the teams can see, with their own eyes, the benefits of the changes they’ve made.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n\n        Tags: \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/data/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003eData\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e        \n            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

However, I didn’t truly appreciate the amount of people and work involved — it requires literally hundreds of Spotifiers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThroughout the project, I was very inspired by the attention to detail shown by our localization teams — we had weekly testing sessions, where the localization manager would identify any issues related to translations and ensure we had a quality experience in all languages. Their input pushed us to work harder on fixing issues that came up with non-Latin characters. And this kind of dedication — along with a real focus on accessibility — is something I’m taking back to my home squad and my day-to-day work at Spotify.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\n         Tags: \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/backend/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003ebackend\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/mobile/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003eMobile\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/wrapped21/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003eWrapped21\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n             Published by Spotify Engineering         \u003c/p\u003e\n     \u003c/div\u003e\n\n     \n     \n\n\n \u003c/article\u003e\n        \n\n        \n        \n    \u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

That includes deciding what music to play during data stories and what images and localised text to display – all the things we serve from the backend to help iOS and Android show the data stories correctly. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"what-were-the-biggest-challenges\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat were the biggest challenges? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLoad-testing was definitely the most challenging aspect of working on this project. In the first few hours after launch, Wrapped gets a high volume of unique visitors – all with their own unique data stories, all served to different types of mobile devices. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo we can’t just roll it out and hope for the best – we have to simulate that load and make sure we can withstand all the requests we’re going to get at peak usage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDuring load test sessions, we process a high volume of requests and try to uncover as many issues across our dependencies as possible.

As mobile developers, that means we want everybody to be able to download our app without hiccups or constraints.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne important metric related to this goal is the size of the Spotify app — if it’s too big, users with poor network connectivity or little device storage might not be able to download it. And since shrinking download size \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/googleplaydev/shrinking-apks-growing-installs-5d3fcba23ce2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ehas been shown\u003c/a\u003e to improve install conversion rate, we aim to keep the app as lean as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut working with app size is not always easy, particularly for large applications with numerous contributors adding cool new features. That’s why we built and open sourced \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spotify/ruler\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eRuler\u003c/a\u003e — a tool to measure and analyze the size of your Android apps, built with automation in mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"where-we-started\"\u003eWhere we started\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe set out to see how we could decrease app size, and started our investigations by using existing tools like \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/jakewharton/diffuse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDiffuse\u003c/a\u003e and Android Studio. Those work great if you want to get a high-level overview of your app, but when we wanted to dig deeper, we quickly arrived at another question — how much are certain modules and dependencies contributing to the overall app size?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe codebase of the main Android Spotify app consists of over 1,000 Gradle modules and hundreds of third-party dependencies. All of these modules and dependencies are merged and packaged into a single app, without a clear way to determine where things came from. This can make it hard to analyze app size and determine where optimization opportunities lie.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRuler is a Gradle plugin that solves this exact problem. It allows you to analyze your app and gives you detailed insights into the origin and size of certain files, modules, and third-party dependencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-does-ruler-work\"\u003eHow does Ruler work?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAndroid apps are typically packaged and uploaded to the Play Store as \u003ca href=\"https://developer.android.com/guide/app-bundle\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eApp Bundles\u003c/a\u003e. The Play Store uses these bundles to generate an optimized \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_application_package\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eAndroid application package (APK)\u003c/a\u003e for every device. Ruler replicates this mechanism (using \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/google/bundletool\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eGoogle’s Bundletool\u003c/a\u003e) to generate an APK for a given device configuration. We do that to accurately measure what ends up on the devices of our users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext, we analyze this APK to see which files actually end up in the app and how much space those files take up, leveraging \u003ca href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/apkanalyzer\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eapkanalyzer\u003c/a\u003e to ensure the numbers reported by Ruler stay consistent with those analyzed by Android Studio and guaranteeing we measure app size after any optimizations done by another process (e.g. R8). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor each file, Ruler captures two measurements:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDownload size: \u003c/strong\u003eBytes transferred over the network when a user downloads the app\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInstall size:\u003c/strong\u003e Bytes a file takes up on the device once the app has been installed\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"determining-the-origin-of-files\"\u003eDetermining the origin of files\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter analyzing the APK, we end up with a list of all files and their respective sizes. But how do we determine where they came from? To do that, Ruler scans through all Gradle modules and dependencies included in the build and analyzes which files they contain. The result of this is a second list of all components and their contents. Based on this second list, we can now group all files of the app by their source and therefore determine how much each module and dependency contributes to the overall app size.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRuler adds a simple analyzeReleaseBundle task to your project, which you can use to execute all this logic. This task will generate two outputs — a JSON report you can use for further processing and an HTML report you can use to analyze and dig into the data yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"class-size\"\u003eClass size\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn Android, all classes are compressed into one or more DEX files. Because we want to be able to see the impact of individual classes, Ruler parses those DEX files and treats every class like a separate file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen classes are compressed, some information is shared between class entries inside the DEX file. Because of that, it’s not possible to 100% accurately measure how much a single class contributes to the overall app size. Ruler solves this problem by approximating the size of each class by setting the raw class size in proportion to the size of the DEX file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"ownership\"\u003eOwnership\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKnowing which components contribute to the size of an app is great, but knowing who owns these components is even better. Because of this, Ruler supports gathering and analyzing app size ownership data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you provide a list of component owners to Ruler, it can analyze the contributions of certain teams to the size of the overall app. This can be helpful to determine who to talk to if questions about certain parts of the app arise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"569\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Example_Ownership-Overview-700x569.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Example_Ownership-Overview-700x569.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Example_Ownership-Overview-250x203.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Example_Ownership-Overview-768x625.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Example_Ownership-Overview-1536x1249.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Example_Ownership-Overview-120x98.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/02/Example_Ownership-Overview.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigures above are for illustrative purposes only.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"ruler-at-spotify\"\u003eRuler at Spotify\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve been using Ruler at Spotify for over half a year now and have seen great success.

As we began exploring, we found that teams were using spreadsheets to track ML metadata and gave us hyper-specific feature requests for their individual problems. We also came away with broader unmet needs such as discovery of ML projects\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e support for ML team collaboration\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e and important product\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003egaps within our own ML Platform tooling. These learnings informed the initial scope of our MVP (minimally viable product) and taught us our first product lesson. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eProduct Lesson 1: Balancing Product Vision and Product Strategy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor the first iteration of the product, we took a \u003ca href=\"https://jchyip.medium.com/why-t-shaped-people-e8706198e437\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eT-shaped\u003c/a\u003e approach. We focused on building horizontal solutions\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003efor needs we heard most commonly across all ML practitioner roles, such as being able to collaborate more effectively as an ML team. We also built a vertical solution\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ethat mapped to a specific platform tooling gap: better evaluation tooling for offline model training for ML engineers.

Individual contributions struggled with the broad idea of a “one-stop shop” and wanted to know what concrete problems the product could solve for them today. Leadership wanted to know how many users we would serve over the long run and how big our impact could be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the process of selling our MVP, we learned how difficult it is to balance product vision and product strategy without compromising one for the other. Had we scratched our broader vision based on the initial feedback and focused exclusively on the concrete needs (e.g., I want to see all my training pipelines in one view), we would have risked delivering a narrow point solution. On the other hand, if we over-indexed our roadmap on the broad, ambiguous needs (e.g. I want to collaborate more effectively with my team), we would have delivered a nice-to-have but not a must-have product. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy intentionally keeping our \u003cstrong\u003eProduct Vision broad\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eand future-looking \u003c/strong\u003e(one-stop shop)\u003cstrong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003ewe gave ourselves the runway to think bigger about our solution space and our potential impact down the line.

It is no secret that driving product adoption is hard, especially for products that are trying to replace existing solutions or market incumbents. We hit the ceiling of our MVP’s potential fairly quickly. We did not see a surge of adoption beyond the handful of users who were involved in the very early ideation process. Most users understood the value proposition of what we were building, but did not see enough depth to switch over from their existing tooling. In retrospect, our expectations of what we delivered and how valuable it would be did not match the depth of our users’ needs. It would have been easy at that stage to dismiss the product entirely, based on early adoption signals. That would have been a mistake. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we plowed on with more detailed user feedback in our quest to drive more adoption, it became clear to us that we were misplacing our expectations on what role the MVP played in the product development process. \u003cstrong\u003eThe most valuable end goal of an MVP is to get enough of the vision and strategies out there to help validate or invalidate them. \u003c/strong\u003eOur initial MVP helped us test and de-risk our work because we were able to get detailed validation of the workflows from ML teams and lay out the technical foundations for the product. It did not matter how many daily active users we had at that stage, as long as we had enough users (which we did) who saw the value in what we were building. These users continued to attend our user feedback sessions and helped us get the product to a higher and more valuable place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eProduct Lesson 3: Knowing the true Differentiators\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we moved beyond the MVP phase and started to map out our next steps (focusing on some aspects of the product over others), we learned our third and perhaps most important product lesson. We realized that in order to provide a really valuable product to our users, we needed to not only reach feature parity with existing solutions, but also double down on ML Home’s unique differentiators. In short, ML Home as a product needed to be more compelling than the competing solutions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while, we probed, debated, and stack-ranked specific features and workflows that we felt would be game-changing for our users. Our theory was that if we built a “compelling feature,” it would be able to singularly pass a threshold for users to adopt. In the end, we realized that the unique differentiators for ML Home actually came in the form of our other ML Platform offerings, not any one individual feature. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile some aspects of ML Home could functionally serve as a stand-alone product, by enriching it with training, evaluation, and system metadata generated from the rest of our ML Platform, it became a much more compelling product. \u003cstrong\u003eML Home’s unique differentiator isn’t any one silver-bullet feature but rather the gateway value it provides as the sum of our ML Platform capabilities.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMuch of the work we did in this phase was building out our metadata service to consolidate our overall entities and concepts across the platform, but we also spent significant time building flexibility into the product’s interface. For example, annotation capabilities such as tagging and notes became key features that enabled teams to customize and mirror their own workflows. That, paired with a faster, slicker product experience and information-rich model comparisons, tipped the balance in our favor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we released the second version of ML Home, we had successfully onboarded more ML teams who were actively using the product in their daily workflows. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-700x473.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-700x473.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-250x169.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-768x519.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-1536x1039.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-120x81.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSample ML Project in ML Home.

We knew that ML Home only served one typical ML workflow. However, in order to be an indispensable product for \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e ML practitioners, it needed to cover more ground. We also knew that tightly coupling ML Home’s capabilities to our existing ML Platform products resulted in a much higher rate of adoption than stand-alone solutions. Armed with these takeaways, we wireframed a broader vision for the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday, ML Home provides Spotify’s ML practitioners with artifacts and workflow metadata of all models passing through individual components of our ML Platform. It includes capabilities such as the ability to track and evaluate offline experiments, visualize results, track and monitor deployed models, explore features, certify models for production readiness, and much more.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough intuitive workflows and simplified information architecture, users are able to quickly spin up a project space to collaborate with their team and discover the 220+ ML projects across Spotify currently listed in ML Home. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have seen a 200% growth in daily active users since we began our scaling efforts a year ago, and ML Home is now solidly entrenched in the daily workflows of some of the most important ML teams at Spotify.

We know this because, in the last year, Spotify’s ML community has proposed new and inventive ways to evolve the product. For exampleML engineers saw the potential to build on top of ML Home and proposed we build production readiness certification of ML models in the interface. In addition, we are exploring aspects such as explainability to advance model interpretability and observability to better understand model health. Then there are the ever-inspiring hack week projects that tell us that our product has taken root at Spotify.

As we began exploring, we found that teams were using spreadsheets to track ML metadata and gave us hyper-specific feature requests for their individual problems. We also came away with broader unmet needs such as discovery of ML projects\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e support for ML team collaboration\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e and important product\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003egaps within our own ML Platform tooling.

We also built a vertical solution\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ethat mapped to a specific platform tooling gap: better evaluation tooling for offline model training for ML engineers.

Individual contributions struggled with the broad idea of a “one-stop shop” and wanted to know what concrete problems the product could solve for them today. Leadership wanted to know how many users we would serve over the long run and how big our impact could be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the process of selling our MVP, we learned how difficult it is to balance product vision and product strategy without compromising one for the other. Had we scratched our broader vision based on the initial feedback and focused exclusively on the concrete needs (e.g., I want to see all my training pipelines in one view), we would have risked delivering a narrow point solution. On the other hand, if we over-indexed our roadmap on the broad, ambiguous needs (e.g. I want to collaborate more effectively with my team), we would have delivered a nice-to-have but not a must-have product. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy intentionally keeping our \u003cstrong\u003eProduct Vision broad\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eand future-looking \u003c/strong\u003e(one-stop shop)\u003cstrong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003ewe gave ourselves the runway to think bigger about our solution space and our potential impact down the line.

It is no secret that driving product adoption is hard, especially for products that are trying to replace existing solutions or market incumbents. We hit the ceiling of our MVP’s potential fairly quickly. We did not see a surge of adoption beyond the handful of users who were involved in the very early ideation process. Most users understood the value proposition of what we were building, but did not see enough depth to switch over from their existing tooling. In retrospect, our expectations of what we delivered and how valuable it would be did not match the depth of our users’ needs. It would have been easy at that stage to dismiss the product entirely, based on early adoption signals. That would have been a mistake. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we plowed on with more detailed user feedback in our quest to drive more adoption, it became clear to us that we were misplacing our expectations on what role the MVP played in the product development process. \u003cstrong\u003eThe most valuable end goal of an MVP is to get enough of the vision and strategies out there to help validate or invalidate them. \u003c/strong\u003eOur initial MVP helped us test and de-risk our work because we were able to get detailed validation of the workflows from ML teams and lay out the technical foundations for the product. It did not matter how many daily active users we had at that stage, as long as we had enough users (which we did) who saw the value in what we were building. These users continued to attend our user feedback sessions and helped us get the product to a higher and more valuable place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eProduct Lesson 3: Knowing the true Differentiators\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we moved beyond the MVP phase and started to map out our next steps (focusing on some aspects of the product over others), we learned our third and perhaps most important product lesson. We realized that in order to provide a really valuable product to our users, we needed to not only reach feature parity with existing solutions, but also double down on ML Home’s unique differentiators. In short, ML Home as a product needed to be more compelling than the competing solutions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while, we probed, debated, and stack-ranked specific features and workflows that we felt would be game-changing for our users. Our theory was that if we built a “compelling feature,” it would be able to singularly pass a threshold for users to adopt. In the end, we realized that the unique differentiators for ML Home actually came in the form of our other ML Platform offerings, not any one individual feature. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile some aspects of ML Home could functionally serve as a stand-alone product, by enriching it with training, evaluation, and system metadata generated from the rest of our ML Platform, it became a much more compelling product. \u003cstrong\u003eML Home’s unique differentiator isn’t any one silver-bullet feature but rather the gateway value it provides as the sum of our ML Platform capabilities.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMuch of the work we did in this phase was building out our metadata service to consolidate our overall entities and concepts across the platform, but we also spent significant time building flexibility into the product’s interface. For example, annotation capabilities such as tagging and notes became key features that enabled teams to customize and mirror their own workflows. That, paired with a faster, slicker product experience and information-rich model comparisons, tipped the balance in our favor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we released the second version of ML Home, we had successfully onboarded more ML teams who were actively using the product in their daily workflows. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-700x473.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-700x473.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-250x169.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-768x519.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-1536x1039.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-120x81.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSample ML Project in ML Home.

We knew that ML Home only served one typical ML workflow. However, in order to be an indispensable product for \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e ML practitioners, it needed to cover more ground. We also knew that tightly coupling ML Home’s capabilities to our existing ML Platform products resulted in a much higher rate of adoption than stand-alone solutions. Armed with these takeaways, we wireframed a broader vision for the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday, ML Home provides Spotify’s ML practitioners with artifacts and workflow metadata of all models passing through individual components of our ML Platform. It includes capabilities such as the ability to track and evaluate offline experiments, visualize results, track and monitor deployed models, explore features, certify models for production readiness, and much more.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough intuitive workflows and simplified information architecture, users are able to quickly spin up a project space to collaborate with their team and discover the 220+ ML projects across Spotify currently listed in ML Home. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have seen a 200% growth in daily active users since we began our scaling efforts a year ago, and ML Home is now solidly entrenched in the daily workflows of some of the most important ML teams at Spotify.

We know this because, in the last year, Spotify’s ML community has proposed new and inventive ways to evolve the product. For exampleML engineers saw the potential to build on top of ML Home and proposed we build production readiness certification of ML models in the interface. In addition, we are exploring aspects such as explainability to advance model interpretability and observability to better understand model health. Then there are the ever-inspiring hack week projects that tell us that our product has taken root at Spotify.

Had we scratched our broader vision based on the initial feedback and focused exclusively on the concrete needs (e.g., I want to see all my training pipelines in one view), we would have risked delivering a narrow point solution. On the other hand, if we over-indexed our roadmap on the broad, ambiguous needs (e.g. I want to collaborate more effectively with my team), we would have delivered a nice-to-have but not a must-have product. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy intentionally keeping our \u003cstrong\u003eProduct Vision broad\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eand future-looking \u003c/strong\u003e(one-stop shop)\u003cstrong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003ewe gave ourselves the runway to think bigger about our solution space and our potential impact down the line.

It is no secret that driving product adoption is hard, especially for products that are trying to replace existing solutions or market incumbents. We hit the ceiling of our MVP’s potential fairly quickly. We did not see a surge of adoption beyond the handful of users who were involved in the very early ideation process. Most users understood the value proposition of what we were building, but did not see enough depth to switch over from their existing tooling. In retrospect, our expectations of what we delivered and how valuable it would be did not match the depth of our users’ needs. It would have been easy at that stage to dismiss the product entirely, based on early adoption signals. That would have been a mistake. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we plowed on with more detailed user feedback in our quest to drive more adoption, it became clear to us that we were misplacing our expectations on what role the MVP played in the product development process. \u003cstrong\u003eThe most valuable end goal of an MVP is to get enough of the vision and strategies out there to help validate or invalidate them. \u003c/strong\u003eOur initial MVP helped us test and de-risk our work because we were able to get detailed validation of the workflows from ML teams and lay out the technical foundations for the product. It did not matter how many daily active users we had at that stage, as long as we had enough users (which we did) who saw the value in what we were building. These users continued to attend our user feedback sessions and helped us get the product to a higher and more valuable place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eProduct Lesson 3: Knowing the true Differentiators\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we moved beyond the MVP phase and started to map out our next steps (focusing on some aspects of the product over others), we learned our third and perhaps most important product lesson. We realized that in order to provide a really valuable product to our users, we needed to not only reach feature parity with existing solutions, but also double down on ML Home’s unique differentiators. In short, ML Home as a product needed to be more compelling than the competing solutions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while, we probed, debated, and stack-ranked specific features and workflows that we felt would be game-changing for our users. Our theory was that if we built a “compelling feature,” it would be able to singularly pass a threshold for users to adopt. In the end, we realized that the unique differentiators for ML Home actually came in the form of our other ML Platform offerings, not any one individual feature. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile some aspects of ML Home could functionally serve as a stand-alone product, by enriching it with training, evaluation, and system metadata generated from the rest of our ML Platform, it became a much more compelling product. \u003cstrong\u003eML Home’s unique differentiator isn’t any one silver-bullet feature but rather the gateway value it provides as the sum of our ML Platform capabilities.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMuch of the work we did in this phase was building out our metadata service to consolidate our overall entities and concepts across the platform, but we also spent significant time building flexibility into the product’s interface. For example, annotation capabilities such as tagging and notes became key features that enabled teams to customize and mirror their own workflows. That, paired with a faster, slicker product experience and information-rich model comparisons, tipped the balance in our favor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we released the second version of ML Home, we had successfully onboarded more ML teams who were actively using the product in their daily workflows. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-700x473.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-700x473.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-250x169.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-768x519.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-1536x1039.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-120x81.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSample ML Project in ML Home.

We knew that ML Home only served one typical ML workflow. However, in order to be an indispensable product for \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e ML practitioners, it needed to cover more ground. We also knew that tightly coupling ML Home’s capabilities to our existing ML Platform products resulted in a much higher rate of adoption than stand-alone solutions. Armed with these takeaways, we wireframed a broader vision for the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday, ML Home provides Spotify’s ML practitioners with artifacts and workflow metadata of all models passing through individual components of our ML Platform. It includes capabilities such as the ability to track and evaluate offline experiments, visualize results, track and monitor deployed models, explore features, certify models for production readiness, and much more.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough intuitive workflows and simplified information architecture, users are able to quickly spin up a project space to collaborate with their team and discover the 220+ ML projects across Spotify currently listed in ML Home. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have seen a 200% growth in daily active users since we began our scaling efforts a year ago, and ML Home is now solidly entrenched in the daily workflows of some of the most important ML teams at Spotify.

We know this because, in the last year, Spotify’s ML community has proposed new and inventive ways to evolve the product. For exampleML engineers saw the potential to build on top of ML Home and proposed we build production readiness certification of ML models in the interface. In addition, we are exploring aspects such as explainability to advance model interpretability and observability to better understand model health. Then there are the ever-inspiring hack week projects that tell us that our product has taken root at Spotify.

As we began exploring, we found that teams were using spreadsheets to track ML metadata and gave us hyper-specific feature requests for their individual problems. We also came away with broader unmet needs such as discovery of ML projects\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e support for ML team collaboration\u003cstrong\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e and important product\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003egaps within our own ML Platform tooling.

Individual contributions struggled with the broad idea of a “one-stop shop” and wanted to know what concrete problems the product could solve for them today. Leadership wanted to know how many users we would serve over the long run and how big our impact could be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the process of selling our MVP, we learned how difficult it is to balance product vision and product strategy without compromising one for the other. Had we scratched our broader vision based on the initial feedback and focused exclusively on the concrete needs (e.g., I want to see all my training pipelines in one view), we would have risked delivering a narrow point solution. On the other hand, if we over-indexed our roadmap on the broad, ambiguous needs (e.g. I want to collaborate more effectively with my team), we would have delivered a nice-to-have but not a must-have product. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy intentionally keeping our \u003cstrong\u003eProduct Vision broad\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eand future-looking \u003c/strong\u003e(one-stop shop)\u003cstrong\u003e, \u003c/strong\u003ewe gave ourselves the runway to think bigger about our solution space and our potential impact down the line.

It is no secret that driving product adoption is hard, especially for products that are trying to replace existing solutions or market incumbents. We hit the ceiling of our MVP’s potential fairly quickly. We did not see a surge of adoption beyond the handful of users who were involved in the very early ideation process. Most users understood the value proposition of what we were building, but did not see enough depth to switch over from their existing tooling. In retrospect, our expectations of what we delivered and how valuable it would be did not match the depth of our users’ needs. It would have been easy at that stage to dismiss the product entirely, based on early adoption signals. That would have been a mistake. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we plowed on with more detailed user feedback in our quest to drive more adoption, it became clear to us that we were misplacing our expectations on what role the MVP played in the product development process. \u003cstrong\u003eThe most valuable end goal of an MVP is to get enough of the vision and strategies out there to help validate or invalidate them. \u003c/strong\u003eOur initial MVP helped us test and de-risk our work because we were able to get detailed validation of the workflows from ML teams and lay out the technical foundations for the product. It did not matter how many daily active users we had at that stage, as long as we had enough users (which we did) who saw the value in what we were building. These users continued to attend our user feedback sessions and helped us get the product to a higher and more valuable place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eProduct Lesson 3: Knowing the true Differentiators\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we moved beyond the MVP phase and started to map out our next steps (focusing on some aspects of the product over others), we learned our third and perhaps most important product lesson. We realized that in order to provide a really valuable product to our users, we needed to not only reach feature parity with existing solutions, but also double down on ML Home’s unique differentiators. In short, ML Home as a product needed to be more compelling than the competing solutions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a while, we probed, debated, and stack-ranked specific features and workflows that we felt would be game-changing for our users. Our theory was that if we built a “compelling feature,” it would be able to singularly pass a threshold for users to adopt. In the end, we realized that the unique differentiators for ML Home actually came in the form of our other ML Platform offerings, not any one individual feature. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile some aspects of ML Home could functionally serve as a stand-alone product, by enriching it with training, evaluation, and system metadata generated from the rest of our ML Platform, it became a much more compelling product. \u003cstrong\u003eML Home’s unique differentiator isn’t any one silver-bullet feature but rather the gateway value it provides as the sum of our ML Platform capabilities.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMuch of the work we did in this phase was building out our metadata service to consolidate our overall entities and concepts across the platform, but we also spent significant time building flexibility into the product’s interface. For example, annotation capabilities such as tagging and notes became key features that enabled teams to customize and mirror their own workflows. That, paired with a faster, slicker product experience and information-rich model comparisons, tipped the balance in our favor. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy the time we released the second version of ML Home, we had successfully onboarded more ML teams who were actively using the product in their daily workflows. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"473\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-700x473.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-700x473.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-250x169.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-768x519.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-1536x1039.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project-120x81.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Sample-NLP-Project.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSample ML Project in ML Home.

We knew that ML Home only served one typical ML workflow. However, in order to be an indispensable product for \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e ML practitioners, it needed to cover more ground. We also knew that tightly coupling ML Home’s capabilities to our existing ML Platform products resulted in a much higher rate of adoption than stand-alone solutions. Armed with these takeaways, we wireframed a broader vision for the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday, ML Home provides Spotify’s ML practitioners with artifacts and workflow metadata of all models passing through individual components of our ML Platform.

Now let’s turn this data into colors. Mystic Michaela stepped in to lend her expertise on auras and their colors. With her guidance, we assigned six core colors to the six mood descriptor categories mentioned above (which include “happy”, “calm”, and “hopeful”). To provide secondary colors to the aura visual, our designer represents mood weights through varying levels of contrast. The more a mood is present in a user’s listening, the darker the color. The less a mood is present in a user’s listening, the lighter the color. In the graphic above, the user has a mood weight of 0.47; therefore, the secondary color would be found in the row labeled Encore 100. Their second mood weight was 0.29; therefore, the secondary color would be found in the row labeled Encore 180.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-700x394.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-700x394.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-250x141.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-768x432.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-1536x864.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-120x68.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreativity and embracing constraints\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have a user’s Audio Aura colors, all that’s left is for design and engineering to consider the last question: how can we engineer an ethereal Aura visual?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur deadline was two weeks away. In our milestones planning, we allocated a few days of engineering per story since we committed to a number of data stories and several new features. We had a few days to explore an elegant aura visual that was feasible on both iOS and Android. Part of the challenge for design is knowing what’s possible for engineering to execute in a dedicated amount of time. And part of the challenge for engineering is accurately estimating the time it will take to build a given design. We had to come up with a solution that made good use of our time and garnered a confident engineering sign-off. Situations like this are very unique to the Wrapped design/engineering experience and through such situations, I’ve learned that creativity comes from embracing constraints and making use of what we have in novel ways.

Now let’s turn this data into colors. Mystic Michaela stepped in to lend her expertise on auras and their colors. With her guidance, we assigned six core colors to the six mood descriptor categories mentioned above (which include “happy”, “calm”, and “hopeful”). To provide secondary colors to the aura visual, our designer represents mood weights through varying levels of contrast. The more a mood is present in a user’s listening, the darker the color. The less a mood is present in a user’s listening, the lighter the color. In the graphic above, the user has a mood weight of 0.47; therefore, the secondary color would be found in the row labeled Encore 100. Their second mood weight was 0.29; therefore, the secondary color would be found in the row labeled Encore 180.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-700x394.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-700x394.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-250x141.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-768x432.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-1536x864.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-120x68.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreativity and embracing constraints\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have a user’s Audio Aura colors, all that’s left is for design and engineering to consider the last question: how can we engineer an ethereal Aura visual?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur deadline was two weeks away. In our milestones planning, we allocated a few days of engineering per story since we committed to a number of data stories and several new features. We had a few days to explore an elegant aura visual that was feasible on both iOS and Android. Part of the challenge for design is knowing what’s possible for engineering to execute in a dedicated amount of time. And part of the challenge for engineering is accurately estimating the time it will take to build a given design. We had to come up with a solution that made good use of our time and garnered a confident engineering sign-off. Situations like this are very unique to the Wrapped design/engineering experience and through such situations, I’ve learned that creativity comes from embracing constraints and making use of what we have in novel ways.

Now let’s turn this data into colors. Mystic Michaela stepped in to lend her expertise on auras and their colors. With her guidance, we assigned six core colors to the six mood descriptor categories mentioned above (which include “happy”, “calm”, and “hopeful”). To provide secondary colors to the aura visual, our designer represents mood weights through varying levels of contrast. The more a mood is present in a user’s listening, the darker the color. The less a mood is present in a user’s listening, the lighter the color. In the graphic above, the user has a mood weight of 0.47; therefore, the secondary color would be found in the row labeled Encore 100. Their second mood weight was 0.29; therefore, the secondary color would be found in the row labeled Encore 180.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-700x394.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-700x394.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-250x141.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-768x432.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-1536x864.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-120x68.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreativity and embracing constraints\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have a user’s Audio Aura colors, all that’s left is for design and engineering to consider the last question: how can we engineer an ethereal Aura visual?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur deadline was two weeks away. In our milestones planning, we allocated a few days of engineering per story since we committed to a number of data stories and several new features. We had a few days to explore an elegant aura visual that was feasible on both iOS and Android. Part of the challenge for design is knowing what’s possible for engineering to execute in a dedicated amount of time. And part of the challenge for engineering is accurately estimating the time it will take to build a given design. We had to come up with a solution that made good use of our time and garnered a confident engineering sign-off. Situations like this are very unique to the Wrapped design/engineering experience and through such situations, I’ve learned that creativity comes from embracing constraints and making use of what we have in novel ways.

With her guidance, we assigned six core colors to the six mood descriptor categories mentioned above (which include “happy”, “calm”, and “hopeful”). To provide secondary colors to the aura visual, our designer represents mood weights through varying levels of contrast. The more a mood is present in a user’s listening, the darker the color. The less a mood is present in a user’s listening, the lighter the color. In the graphic above, the user has a mood weight of 0.47; therefore, the secondary color would be found in the row labeled Encore 100. Their second mood weight was 0.29; therefore, the secondary color would be found in the row labeled Encore 180.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"394\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-700x394.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-700x394.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-250x141.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-768x432.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-1536x864.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors-120x68.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Core-Colors.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreativity and embracing constraints\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have a user’s Audio Aura colors, all that’s left is for design and engineering to consider the last question: how can we engineer an ethereal Aura visual?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur deadline was two weeks away. In our milestones planning, we allocated a few days of engineering per story since we committed to a number of data stories and several new features. We had a few days to explore an elegant aura visual that was feasible on both iOS and Android. Part of the challenge for design is knowing what’s possible for engineering to execute in a dedicated amount of time. And part of the challenge for engineering is accurately estimating the time it will take to build a given design. We had to come up with a solution that made good use of our time and garnered a confident engineering sign-off. Situations like this are very unique to the Wrapped design/engineering experience and through such situations, I’ve learned that creativity comes from embracing constraints and making use of what we have in novel ways.

From inception, to prototyping, to QAing, and finally shipping, releasing a new playlist at Spotify is a long process full of new learnings every time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe recently launched a new playlist initiative, \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-08-31/how-spotifys-newest-personalized-experience-blend-creates-a-playlist-for-you-and-your-bestie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBlend\u003c/a\u003e, where any user can invite any user to generate a playlist wherein the two users’ tastes are combined into one shared playlist. Prior to Blend, the team worked on similar products, Family Mix and Duo Mix. These products create shared playlists for users on the same Family or Duo plan. The products were well received, so we decided to expand this product line, creating a version of opt-in, automatic, shared, personalized playlists that could work for any two users. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnytime we want to make a new playlist at Spotify, we’re aiming to do something different that we haven’t been able to accomplish before. This means we can’t always lean on our past experiences, and often encounter new challenges that require new solutions. With Blend in particular, we were taking concepts from Family Mix and Duo Mix, and expanding them to a much larger user group. A major complication we saw here was the increase of scale in the number of users we had to deal with. We dealt with unique challenges both in the content creation process, and in the invitation flow, to create a Blend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost playlists are composed of a number of attributes and characteristics. For example, with Discover Weekly, our main attribute is discovery. For Daily Mix, our attributes are familiarity and coherency. When we are working with multiple users, however, we have the challenge of taking more attributes into account. Is the playlist:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRelevant:\u003c/strong\u003e Does the track we’re selecting for that user reflect their taste? Or is it just a song they accidentally listened to once?\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThis is especially important for track attribution — if we put a user’s profile image next to a song, we need to make sure that this specific user would agree the song listed is representative of their taste.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCoherent: \u003c/strong\u003eDoes the playlist have flow, or do the tracks feel completely random and unrelated to each other?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEqual:\u003c/strong\u003e Are both users in the Blend represented equally?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDemocratic:\u003c/strong\u003e Does music that both users like rise to the top?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the core decisions we made for this product was whether it was better to “minimize the misery” or “maximize the joy”. In other words, is it better to pick everyone’s favorite tracks, even if other people in the group wouldn’t like them, or is it better to pick the tracks that everyone is likely to like, even if their favorite songs never get selected? “Minimize the misery” is valuing democratic and coherent attributes over relevance. “Maximize the joy” values relevance over democratic and coherent attributes. Our solution is more about maximizing the joy, where we try to select the songs that are most personally relevant to a user. This decision was made based on feedback from employees and our data curation team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"477\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-700x477.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-700x477.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-250x170.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-768x524.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-1536x1047.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-2048x1397.png 2048w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-120x82.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a bit simpler to create a Blend with users with similar taste since they listen to a lot of the same music. However, if we have two users with no common music listening history, it’s significantly more difficult to create a perfect Blend. We needed an approach that worked for both types of pairs, while also taking into consideration how any changes to the Blend algorithm impacts all combinations of users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBetween fetching data for both users in the Blend, and trying to come up with the ideal sequence balancing for all of our attributes, creating a Blend is a pretty heavy process. When we tried to come up with the best algorithm, we weren’t so concerned about our latency. Once we were happy with Blend quality, and started to think about scaling the service, we realized how bad our latency had gotten while iterating on the algorithm. We spent a lot of time trying to make the service as fast as possible. What we learned is that our code base had some hot spots in it: some sections of the code were run over 50 times per Blend generation, while other sections of the code were only run once. If we tried to optimize sections of the code that weren’t run many times, we didn’t make much of an impact in our latency. However, when we made improvements to our hot spots, we were able to make a huge difference. The biggest example here was swapping the order of two function calls within an if statement, taking advantage of Java’s short circuiting. This simple code change reduced our latency to 1/10 of its original time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe were able to make content quality improvements by using both qualitative and quantitative methods. While we normally rely on testing our own playlists when we make changes, we also needed to make sure that we checked several different types of Blends (for example: test a high taste overlap Blend and a low taste overlap Blend).

Prior to Blend, the team worked on similar products, Family Mix and Duo Mix. These products create shared playlists for users on the same Family or Duo plan. The products were well received, so we decided to expand this product line, creating a version of opt-in, automatic, shared, personalized playlists that could work for any two users. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnytime we want to make a new playlist at Spotify, we’re aiming to do something different that we haven’t been able to accomplish before. This means we can’t always lean on our past experiences, and often encounter new challenges that require new solutions. With Blend in particular, we were taking concepts from Family Mix and Duo Mix, and expanding them to a much larger user group. A major complication we saw here was the increase of scale in the number of users we had to deal with. We dealt with unique challenges both in the content creation process, and in the invitation flow, to create a Blend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost playlists are composed of a number of attributes and characteristics. For example, with Discover Weekly, our main attribute is discovery. For Daily Mix, our attributes are familiarity and coherency. When we are working with multiple users, however, we have the challenge of taking more attributes into account.

In other words, is it better to pick everyone’s favorite tracks, even if other people in the group wouldn’t like them, or is it better to pick the tracks that everyone is likely to like, even if their favorite songs never get selected? “Minimize the misery” is valuing democratic and coherent attributes over relevance. “Maximize the joy” values relevance over democratic and coherent attributes. Our solution is more about maximizing the joy, where we try to select the songs that are most personally relevant to a user. This decision was made based on feedback from employees and our data curation team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"477\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-700x477.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-700x477.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-250x170.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-768x524.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-1536x1047.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-2048x1397.png 2048w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-120x82.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a bit simpler to create a Blend with users with similar taste since they listen to a lot of the same music. However, if we have two users with no common music listening history, it’s significantly more difficult to create a perfect Blend. We needed an approach that worked for both types of pairs, while also taking into consideration how any changes to the Blend algorithm impacts all combinations of users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBetween fetching data for both users in the Blend, and trying to come up with the ideal sequence balancing for all of our attributes, creating a Blend is a pretty heavy process. When we tried to come up with the best algorithm, we weren’t so concerned about our latency. Once we were happy with Blend quality, and started to think about scaling the service, we realized how bad our latency had gotten while iterating on the algorithm. We spent a lot of time trying to make the service as fast as possible. What we learned is that our code base had some hot spots in it: some sections of the code were run over 50 times per Blend generation, while other sections of the code were only run once. If we tried to optimize sections of the code that weren’t run many times, we didn’t make much of an impact in our latency. However, when we made improvements to our hot spots, we were able to make a huge difference. The biggest example here was swapping the order of two function calls within an if statement, taking advantage of Java’s short circuiting. This simple code change reduced our latency to 1/10 of its original time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe were able to make content quality improvements by using both qualitative and quantitative methods. While we normally rely on testing our own playlists when we make changes, we also needed to make sure that we checked several different types of Blends (for example: test a high taste overlap Blend and a low taste overlap Blend). We created some offline metrics to measure how our attributes performed. We also work closely with a Data Curation team, often referred to as the “humans in the loop”. The Data Curation team evaluates and ensures content quality for recommendation systems. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, when the team wanted to make a change to make the playlist more coherent, we:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTested our own playlists — the team had implemented the change for about a month before we evaluated it.

In other words, is it better to pick everyone’s favorite tracks, even if other people in the group wouldn’t like them, or is it better to pick the tracks that everyone is likely to like, even if their favorite songs never get selected? “Minimize the misery” is valuing democratic and coherent attributes over relevance. “Maximize the joy” values relevance over democratic and coherent attributes. Our solution is more about maximizing the joy, where we try to select the songs that are most personally relevant to a user. This decision was made based on feedback from employees and our data curation team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"477\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-700x477.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-700x477.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-250x170.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-768x524.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-1536x1047.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-2048x1397.png 2048w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/Blend_Mix-120x82.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a bit simpler to create a Blend with users with similar taste since they listen to a lot of the same music. However, if we have two users with no common music listening history, it’s significantly more difficult to create a perfect Blend. We needed an approach that worked for both types of pairs, while also taking into consideration how any changes to the Blend algorithm impacts all combinations of users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBetween fetching data for both users in the Blend, and trying to come up with the ideal sequence balancing for all of our attributes, creating a Blend is a pretty heavy process. When we tried to come up with the best algorithm, we weren’t so concerned about our latency. Once we were happy with Blend quality, and started to think about scaling the service, we realized how bad our latency had gotten while iterating on the algorithm. We spent a lot of time trying to make the service as fast as possible. What we learned is that our code base had some hot spots in it: some sections of the code were run over 50 times per Blend generation, while other sections of the code were only run once. If we tried to optimize sections of the code that weren’t run many times, we didn’t make much of an impact in our latency. However, when we made improvements to our hot spots, we were able to make a huge difference. The biggest example here was swapping the order of two function calls within an if statement, taking advantage of Java’s short circuiting. This simple code change reduced our latency to 1/10 of its original time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe were able to make content quality improvements by using both qualitative and quantitative methods. While we normally rely on testing our own playlists when we make changes, we also needed to make sure that we checked several different types of Blends (for example: test a high taste overlap Blend and a low taste overlap Blend). We created some offline metrics to measure how our attributes performed. We also work closely with a Data Curation team, often referred to as the “humans in the loop”.

Prior to Blend, the team worked on similar products, Family Mix and Duo Mix. These products create shared playlists for users on the same Family or Duo plan. The products were well received, so we decided to expand this product line, creating a version of opt-in, automatic, shared, personalized playlists that could work for any two users. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnytime we want to make a new playlist at Spotify, we’re aiming to do something different that we haven’t been able to accomplish before. This means we can’t always lean on our past experiences, and often encounter new challenges that require new solutions. With Blend in particular, we were taking concepts from Family Mix and Duo Mix, and expanding them to a much larger user group. A major complication we saw here was the increase of scale in the number of users we had to deal with. We dealt with unique challenges both in the content creation process, and in the invitation flow, to create a Blend.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost playlists are composed of a number of attributes and characteristics. For example, with Discover Weekly, our main attribute is discovery. For Daily Mix, our attributes are familiarity and coherency. When we are working with multiple users, however, we have the challenge of taking more attributes into account.

At the most fundamental level, all sorts of user info — playlists, listening history, interactions with Spotify’s UI, etc. — are fed into our ML models, while keeping trust and responsibility top of mind. Every day, nearly half a trillion events are processed, and the more info our models gather, the smarter they become about making associations between different artists, songs, podcasts, and playlists.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut our ML models even go beyond this, incorporating other factors in their decision-making processes. What time of day is it? Is this playlist for working out or chilling out? Are you on mobile or desktop? By incorporating several of these ML models throughout Spotify’s infrastructure, we’re able to offer increasingly intelligent, specialized recommendations that can, as Oskar puts it, “serve even the narrowest of tastes”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe aren’t just looking for our users’ instant gratification, though.

This platform could easily launch hundreds of experiments by using a configuration file to specify hyperparameters (it also supported a grid search on specified hyperparameters). And since everything that was submitted to run an experiment was a script, it supported custom evaluation metrics — something that has always been important in our team. While it provided these necessary features, it wasn’t scalable, wasn’t maintained, and had an incomplete UI. Sometimes the compute instances would lose connection with the API (via a periodic ping) and would end up being ghost workers — still running, but not connected to anything.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eHow it’s going: integration with Spotify ML ecosystem\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/12/13/the-winding-road-to-better-machine-learning-infrastructure-through-tensorflow-extended-and-kubeflow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify’s managed Kubeflow clusters\u003c/a\u003e provide a more scalable approach, modular components, and are compatible with other parts of the Spotify ML infrastructure, so it was an obvious choice to move our experimentation to this platform. Training our models using Kubeflow pipelines is easy and efficient, but running the evaluation we needed and tracking those results were our biggest pain points for two reasons: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs Spotify’s SDK for Kubeflow uses Tensorflow Model Analysis (TFMA), comparing the performance of a non-ML heuristic algorithm to that of a trained model is challenging to set up and requires extra infrastructure. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe often have custom evaluation metrics that are specific to the model’s task, but they are infinitely more difficult to implement in TFMA than in vanilla Python.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eEvaluating models against simpler (non-ML) solutions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs I alluded to in an earlier paragraph, we don’t typically start solutions to a problem with an ML solution. We first identify a heuristic, or rule-based, solution, and the most appropriate way to evaluate it.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe first step — having a baseline for comparison\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are often tasked with creating better recommendations for content X, but what are “better recommendations,” and what are they better than? Having a baseline helps answer these questions, giving us something to compare our models against. And a good baseline — usually a heuristic/rule-based solution — is a quick, efficient, but maybe not the most optimal, solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake the Shortcuts Model as an example. We created an initial heuristic that recommended, simply, the most frequently played items from a listener’s short-term listening history. We improved the heuristic over many iterations, then compared it to the performance of the models we trained. Being able to compare these heuristics to the models gave us confidence to say that having a model was an improvement over the heuristics and was worth the extra effort of maintaining, deploying, and monitoring these models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eComparing model performance to baseline performance is difficult\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter establishing our baseline and training our model(s), the difficulty lies in how we compare them evenly. In a perfect world we would run infinite A/B tests with hundreds of test cells to compare the performance of all our solutions in the real world, on real listeners. Since it’s not a perfect world, we need reliable offline metrics that act as a proxy for the online metrics we can’t get in those A/B tests.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen evaluating our recommendations models, we typically use normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG@k) as our metric, which can be implemented using Spotify’s Python SDK for Kubeflow pipelines. The question then becomes: how do we do the same for our heuristic? As we’ve mentioned before, transformation logic consistency is paramount, and so is evaluation logic — ideally, we’d have the same evaluation logic and the same evaluation test set of data. Unfortunately, our heuristics are generally written in a Java service and are tested with unit tests (not for performance).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor fairly simple heuristics, we found a way to “train a model” so that its output is the heuristic rule’s output. This allowed us to use the same evaluation and evaluation test set as the models we were comparing against. We took this same approach when coming up with a solution to recommendations in the \u003cem\u003eTry something else\u003c/em\u003e shelf for new users on Home. We computed a popularity heuristic based on a listener’s demographics in Tensorflow Transform (TFT) and used the model as a lookup utility (with a fake loss).  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can’t always fit our problem into such a simple heuristic, as was the case for Shortcuts. The logic used in most of the Shortcuts heuristics was too complex to write in Tensorflow, so we implemented a completely separate offline evaluation pipeline that would gather recommendations made by models and heuristics, and apply custom evaluation functions for comparison.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eAdding freedom and flexibility to our evaluation tools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned earlier, there’s a second pain point we run into often: using custom evaluation metrics in TFMA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eTFMA is sometimes too rigid\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify’s SDK for Kubeflow only supports evaluations using TFMA, which provides fairly basic metrics out of the box — think: precision, recall, accuracy. The most common metric we typically use is NDCG@k — TFMA provides NDCG, but not NDCG@k. Implementing metrics in TFMA is notoriously difficult; it takes ~120 lines of code to implement NDCG@k in TFMA, but only a single line of code using scikit-learn in Python.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost recently, we were experimenting with a model that predicts the next playlist that a new user will listen to, and as we have very little information about new users, we wanted to ensure that the model was not just predicting the most popular content. To do so, we were going to evaluate the model with a diversity metric that measured the difference between specific characteristics of items in each playlist. This was nearly impossible to implement in TFMA, so our team contributed to the Python SDK for Kubeflow to support any custom Python evaluation. We have been using this and running our experiments via Kubeflow pipelines since October 2020. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eCompare and track experiment results\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the pre-Kubeflow world, our experimentation platform allowed for a way to track and compare models — now, we are using Spotify’s internal UI for machine learning, as it easily integrates with our Kubeflow runs. We can view and compare the evaluation scores of our experiments — both NDCG and custom metrics — in the UI. We’ve been using this for a number of our models, and it allows us to track our model deployments as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eLooking at more than just the numbers for evaluating recommendations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve mostly mentioned what metrics we use and why they are important, but there is another incredibly useful way we evaluate our models — sometimes more useful than what a metric can reveal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eWe build custom dashboards to manually evaluate the recs\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBased on past issues, we know that evaluation metrics don’t show the whole picture of how well a model is recommending content. Sometimes, the best way to evaluate a model is by seeing what content it recommends given a specific set of features about a listener. And for this reason, our team built a dashboard that does exactly that. It loads models simply by supplying the storage location of the model, and supports comparison of multiple models given a set of features. We often test and evaluate the recommendations that a new model will provide before deploying it to production by making predictions with different sets of feature values; this gives us an intuition behind what content will be recommended to different users that have these feature values. This has helped us find glaring issues; for example, when developing and testing a new model, we found that it would recommend the same popular playlist to listeners in all European countries. Having this knowledge allowed us to fix and improve the model before deploying it to production.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost recently, we have been working on a new model to recommend albums a listener might like based on their locality and what they like to listen to. We have been running experiments comparing evaluation metric values, but we have also been looking at the recommendations on our dashboard. This dashboard gives you the ability to try different features and compare the recommendations across different models — all before the models are used to recommend content to our listeners. At the beginning stages of experimentation and modeling for this project, we noticed that the same album was recommended as the first item no matter what input features (such as user’s country, followed artists, etc.) were used for testing, meaning this album would have been recommended to everyone as the first recommendation. Without this dashboard as a tool, it would have been more challenging to identify this issue and remediate it before the model went live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile our offline metrics might indicate poor performance, they don’t tell us anything about what the reason might be, whereas this dashboard can show the quality of our recommendations and is extremely useful in finding issues like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the use of task-specific custom evaluations and dashboards to show evaluation metrics and recommendations per feature set, we have been able to gain deep insight into how our models are behaving, and make our models a little less of a black box. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe struggles of automated model retraining and deployment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s dive into our last topic, which is all about maintaining models in production: retraining and automatic deployment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBut do we actually need to retrain our models?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be really nice if we could train a model once, deploy it, and then not have to do anything except monitor its online performance. Sadly, we’ve never seen this in reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eSometimes the model’s task requires frequent retraining\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince we first deployed the Podcast Model in Home, we have always had retraining set up for it — and that’s because it only recommends podcast shows that it has seen in training data. So if we didn’t retrain it, it wouldn’t recommend any newly published shows.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe rest of the time, it just becomes a tech debt monster\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut in some cases, retraining isn’t necessarily required to capture the full set of possible candidates. For the Shortcuts Model, we didn’t have retraining set up because it only recommends content that the listener has previously listened to (which is always in the serving features). But while retraining wasn’t needed for the Shortcuts Model to operate, the lack of it became one of the biggest sources of ML tech debt. We did not implement retraining for Shortcuts because it wasn’t needed for launching the feature, but have seen that it would have saved us time and effort in the long run had we invested some time in the short term. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t until many months after the launch of the model that we saw issues with the quality of recommendations in Shortcuts due to no retraining — some of the features for this model describe the type of content that a listener has listened to, like whether it’s a personalized playlist or an album, etc., and there was a recent addition of a new type of content that was introduced after the model was last trained. As a result, the model didn’t recommend this piece of content in Shortcuts. While this starts to look like the same scenario as the Podcast Model described above, we also saw issues with migrating to different tools and platforms because the model was trained using older versions of libraries.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eImplement for the short term while waiting for the long-term solution\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce upon a time, we only had that singular Podcast Model, which was used to generate batch predictions, not real-time predictions. We had a Scio pipeline that used \u003ca href=\"https://spotify.github.io/zoltar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eZoltar\u003c/a\u003e to predict podcast recommendations for all listeners, and we stored these predictions in our Bigtable instance that holds all of our content recommendations. This was a great start, but fairly inflexible when it came to when and how often we could make predictions for a given listener — and this is important because the listeners’ features could change if they listen to new content or follow new artists, which could provide better information to the model.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eBuilding a recommender service for the short term\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsequently, we built a new service to serve this model and enable online predictions. We could get fresh recommendations for a listener almost instantly, and we could get these recommendations at useful times, such as when a listener follows a new artist. While this was a great improvement to move from offline predictions to online predictions, and an important step in making a better product, we knew we were only going to be in this state for the short term. Spotify’s online serving platform was on the horizon, but not yet ready; the benefits to building a short-term less-than-optimal solution outweighed the benefits of waiting to serve online models until Spotify’s serving solution was production ready.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith that said, let’s talk about some challenges we faced in building this recommender service, such as how to refresh the local version of a deployed model. Our solution was to poll our internal storage directory every 10 minutes to check if there was a new revision of the model; if so, the service would pull the model down from where it was stored and start using that model to make predictions. Nevermind that we only retrained weekly or that there would be some state at which some machines would have the new revision of a model and others would have the older revision (although this was not something we worried about in our specific use case).  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe pain of manually deploying models\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis was really a solution to serving models online, and less of a solution to a better process of serving models. Each time we wanted to deploy a model we had to: 1) copy the model to a specific storage location, 2) manually generate a pointer in our internal storage directory for that location, and 3) add this pointer to our recommender service along with the logic to fetch and transform features for the model. If we were to retrain the model, we would have to repeat each of those steps.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, this was a cumbersome process, but because we had this short-term solution, we were able to deploy four models to production and tested many others in A/B tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eCI/CD — but make it for model training and deployment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this recommender service lived a long life of about 10 months, the next obvious step was to migrate to Spotify’s model serving platform, which enabled us to automate retraining and deployment of retrained models.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eAutomating feature transformations without Tensorflow Transform\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step in automating retraining is automating train dataset and test dataset curation, fetching the correct features and performing the necessary feature transformations. While feature transformations are generally handled automatically via TFT in a Kubeflow pipeline, we don’t perform our feature transformations in TFT (and therefore not in our experiment pipeline) because many the transformations we perform on the data are fairly complex and would be unnecessarily difficult to do in Tensorflow.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut because the serving platform provides feature logging, we enabled logging of \u003cem\u003ealready transformed\u003c/em\u003e features, to which we then apply the correct labels, and separate into train and test sets. These actions are all performed in scheduled pipelines that run weekly and produce weekly datasets for our models to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eMigrating from our short-term solution to a long-term solution\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to enable feature logging, we had to migrate to the new online model serving platform from our recommender service using Zoltar. It was a matter of dark loading all prediction traffic to the new deployment and then running a simple rollout to start directing traffic to our new deployment instead of using Zoltar to make predictions in our own service. This was an easy migration and provided the benefits that the online serving platform offers — feature logging, faster predictions / lower latencies, less code managed by our team — and it also supports pushing a new model version (from a Kubeflow pipeline), as opposed to constantly polling for a new model version. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eContinuous retraining and automatic deployment\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that our models are all deployed via the Spotify serving platform, it enables us to employ CI/CD. We can schedule our models to be retrained via a Kubeflow pipeline, and as part of the Kubeflow pipeline we can ensure that a “bad” model is not accidentally automatically deployed by specifying that it should: 1) check that the evaluation score is greater than our configured threshold, and 2) automatically push it to our serving infrastructure if it is greater than the threshold. This automates a lot of the processes that we had to perform manually not long ago.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnabling CI/CD for retraining and model deployment is hard, but it’s becoming easier with the new tools available and makes the quality and reliability of our models better. And at first glance, you might not think you need retraining for a model because of the task it performs, but without it, your model could make predictions in unpredictable ways and increase your tech debt.   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur ML stack has come a long way in recent years, but it’s not perfect by any means. There are still a number of challenges we are tackling — data versioning, model versioning, moving feature transformations to Tensorflow Transform — and better ways to compare offline metrics across both ML and non-ML solutions. But it has decreased the time it takes for us to iterate, experiment, and deploy quality models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have adopted and/or built the components we need to successfully and efficiently manage our data, experiment with different models, and support continuous integration and development throughout the deployment and retraining processes.

This platform could easily launch hundreds of experiments by using a configuration file to specify hyperparameters (it also supported a grid search on specified hyperparameters). And since everything that was submitted to run an experiment was a script, it supported custom evaluation metrics — something that has always been important in our team. While it provided these necessary features, it wasn’t scalable, wasn’t maintained, and had an incomplete UI. Sometimes the compute instances would lose connection with the API (via a periodic ping) and would end up being ghost workers — still running, but not connected to anything.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eHow it’s going: integration with Spotify ML ecosystem\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/12/13/the-winding-road-to-better-machine-learning-infrastructure-through-tensorflow-extended-and-kubeflow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify’s managed Kubeflow clusters\u003c/a\u003e provide a more scalable approach, modular components, and are compatible with other parts of the Spotify ML infrastructure, so it was an obvious choice to move our experimentation to this platform. Training our models using Kubeflow pipelines is easy and efficient, but running the evaluation we needed and tracking those results were our biggest pain points for two reasons: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs Spotify’s SDK for Kubeflow uses Tensorflow Model Analysis (TFMA), comparing the performance of a non-ML heuristic algorithm to that of a trained model is challenging to set up and requires extra infrastructure. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe often have custom evaluation metrics that are specific to the model’s task, but they are infinitely more difficult to implement in TFMA than in vanilla Python.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eEvaluating models against simpler (non-ML) solutions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs I alluded to in an earlier paragraph, we don’t typically start solutions to a problem with an ML solution. We first identify a heuristic, or rule-based, solution, and the most appropriate way to evaluate it.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe first step — having a baseline for comparison\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are often tasked with creating better recommendations for content X, but what are “better recommendations,” and what are they better than? Having a baseline helps answer these questions, giving us something to compare our models against. And a good baseline — usually a heuristic/rule-based solution — is a quick, efficient, but maybe not the most optimal, solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake the Shortcuts Model as an example. We created an initial heuristic that recommended, simply, the most frequently played items from a listener’s short-term listening history. We improved the heuristic over many iterations, then compared it to the performance of the models we trained. Being able to compare these heuristics to the models gave us confidence to say that having a model was an improvement over the heuristics and was worth the extra effort of maintaining, deploying, and monitoring these models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eComparing model performance to baseline performance is difficult\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter establishing our baseline and training our model(s), the difficulty lies in how we compare them evenly. In a perfect world we would run infinite A/B tests with hundreds of test cells to compare the performance of all our solutions in the real world, on real listeners. Since it’s not a perfect world, we need reliable offline metrics that act as a proxy for the online metrics we can’t get in those A/B tests.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen evaluating our recommendations models, we typically use normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG@k) as our metric, which can be implemented using Spotify’s Python SDK for Kubeflow pipelines. The question then becomes: how do we do the same for our heuristic? As we’ve mentioned before, transformation logic consistency is paramount, and so is evaluation logic — ideally, we’d have the same evaluation logic and the same evaluation test set of data. Unfortunately, our heuristics are generally written in a Java service and are tested with unit tests (not for performance).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor fairly simple heuristics, we found a way to “train a model” so that its output is the heuristic rule’s output. This allowed us to use the same evaluation and evaluation test set as the models we were comparing against. We took this same approach when coming up with a solution to recommendations in the \u003cem\u003eTry something else\u003c/em\u003e shelf for new users on Home. We computed a popularity heuristic based on a listener’s demographics in Tensorflow Transform (TFT) and used the model as a lookup utility (with a fake loss).  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can’t always fit our problem into such a simple heuristic, as was the case for Shortcuts. The logic used in most of the Shortcuts heuristics was too complex to write in Tensorflow, so we implemented a completely separate offline evaluation pipeline that would gather recommendations made by models and heuristics, and apply custom evaluation functions for comparison.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eAdding freedom and flexibility to our evaluation tools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned earlier, there’s a second pain point we run into often: using custom evaluation metrics in TFMA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eTFMA is sometimes too rigid\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify’s SDK for Kubeflow only supports evaluations using TFMA, which provides fairly basic metrics out of the box — think: precision, recall, accuracy. The most common metric we typically use is NDCG@k — TFMA provides NDCG, but not NDCG@k. Implementing metrics in TFMA is notoriously difficult; it takes ~120 lines of code to implement NDCG@k in TFMA, but only a single line of code using scikit-learn in Python.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost recently, we were experimenting with a model that predicts the next playlist that a new user will listen to, and as we have very little information about new users, we wanted to ensure that the model was not just predicting the most popular content. To do so, we were going to evaluate the model with a diversity metric that measured the difference between specific characteristics of items in each playlist. This was nearly impossible to implement in TFMA, so our team contributed to the Python SDK for Kubeflow to support any custom Python evaluation. We have been using this and running our experiments via Kubeflow pipelines since October 2020. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eCompare and track experiment results\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the pre-Kubeflow world, our experimentation platform allowed for a way to track and compare models — now, we are using Spotify’s internal UI for machine learning, as it easily integrates with our Kubeflow runs. We can view and compare the evaluation scores of our experiments — both NDCG and custom metrics — in the UI. We’ve been using this for a number of our models, and it allows us to track our model deployments as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eLooking at more than just the numbers for evaluating recommendations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve mostly mentioned what metrics we use and why they are important, but there is another incredibly useful way we evaluate our models — sometimes more useful than what a metric can reveal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eWe build custom dashboards to manually evaluate the recs\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBased on past issues, we know that evaluation metrics don’t show the whole picture of how well a model is recommending content. Sometimes, the best way to evaluate a model is by seeing what content it recommends given a specific set of features about a listener. And for this reason, our team built a dashboard that does exactly that. It loads models simply by supplying the storage location of the model, and supports comparison of multiple models given a set of features. We often test and evaluate the recommendations that a new model will provide before deploying it to production by making predictions with different sets of feature values; this gives us an intuition behind what content will be recommended to different users that have these feature values. This has helped us find glaring issues; for example, when developing and testing a new model, we found that it would recommend the same popular playlist to listeners in all European countries. Having this knowledge allowed us to fix and improve the model before deploying it to production.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost recently, we have been working on a new model to recommend albums a listener might like based on their locality and what they like to listen to. We have been running experiments comparing evaluation metric values, but we have also been looking at the recommendations on our dashboard. This dashboard gives you the ability to try different features and compare the recommendations across different models — all before the models are used to recommend content to our listeners. At the beginning stages of experimentation and modeling for this project, we noticed that the same album was recommended as the first item no matter what input features (such as user’s country, followed artists, etc.) were used for testing, meaning this album would have been recommended to everyone as the first recommendation. Without this dashboard as a tool, it would have been more challenging to identify this issue and remediate it before the model went live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile our offline metrics might indicate poor performance, they don’t tell us anything about what the reason might be, whereas this dashboard can show the quality of our recommendations and is extremely useful in finding issues like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the use of task-specific custom evaluations and dashboards to show evaluation metrics and recommendations per feature set, we have been able to gain deep insight into how our models are behaving, and make our models a little less of a black box. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe struggles of automated model retraining and deployment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s dive into our last topic, which is all about maintaining models in production: retraining and automatic deployment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBut do we actually need to retrain our models?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be really nice if we could train a model once, deploy it, and then not have to do anything except monitor its online performance. Sadly, we’ve never seen this in reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eSometimes the model’s task requires frequent retraining\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince we first deployed the Podcast Model in Home, we have always had retraining set up for it — and that’s because it only recommends podcast shows that it has seen in training data. So if we didn’t retrain it, it wouldn’t recommend any newly published shows.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe rest of the time, it just becomes a tech debt monster\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut in some cases, retraining isn’t necessarily required to capture the full set of possible candidates. For the Shortcuts Model, we didn’t have retraining set up because it only recommends content that the listener has previously listened to (which is always in the serving features). But while retraining wasn’t needed for the Shortcuts Model to operate, the lack of it became one of the biggest sources of ML tech debt. We did not implement retraining for Shortcuts because it wasn’t needed for launching the feature, but have seen that it would have saved us time and effort in the long run had we invested some time in the short term. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t until many months after the launch of the model that we saw issues with the quality of recommendations in Shortcuts due to no retraining — some of the features for this model describe the type of content that a listener has listened to, like whether it’s a personalized playlist or an album, etc., and there was a recent addition of a new type of content that was introduced after the model was last trained. As a result, the model didn’t recommend this piece of content in Shortcuts. While this starts to look like the same scenario as the Podcast Model described above, we also saw issues with migrating to different tools and platforms because the model was trained using older versions of libraries.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eImplement for the short term while waiting for the long-term solution\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce upon a time, we only had that singular Podcast Model, which was used to generate batch predictions, not real-time predictions. We had a Scio pipeline that used \u003ca href=\"https://spotify.github.io/zoltar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eZoltar\u003c/a\u003e to predict podcast recommendations for all listeners, and we stored these predictions in our Bigtable instance that holds all of our content recommendations. This was a great start, but fairly inflexible when it came to when and how often we could make predictions for a given listener — and this is important because the listeners’ features could change if they listen to new content or follow new artists, which could provide better information to the model.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eBuilding a recommender service for the short term\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsequently, we built a new service to serve this model and enable online predictions. We could get fresh recommendations for a listener almost instantly, and we could get these recommendations at useful times, such as when a listener follows a new artist. While this was a great improvement to move from offline predictions to online predictions, and an important step in making a better product, we knew we were only going to be in this state for the short term. Spotify’s online serving platform was on the horizon, but not yet ready; the benefits to building a short-term less-than-optimal solution outweighed the benefits of waiting to serve online models until Spotify’s serving solution was production ready.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith that said, let’s talk about some challenges we faced in building this recommender service, such as how to refresh the local version of a deployed model. Our solution was to poll our internal storage directory every 10 minutes to check if there was a new revision of the model; if so, the service would pull the model down from where it was stored and start using that model to make predictions. Nevermind that we only retrained weekly or that there would be some state at which some machines would have the new revision of a model and others would have the older revision (although this was not something we worried about in our specific use case).  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe pain of manually deploying models\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis was really a solution to serving models online, and less of a solution to a better process of serving models. Each time we wanted to deploy a model we had to: 1) copy the model to a specific storage location, 2) manually generate a pointer in our internal storage directory for that location, and 3) add this pointer to our recommender service along with the logic to fetch and transform features for the model. If we were to retrain the model, we would have to repeat each of those steps.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, this was a cumbersome process, but because we had this short-term solution, we were able to deploy four models to production and tested many others in A/B tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eCI/CD — but make it for model training and deployment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this recommender service lived a long life of about 10 months, the next obvious step was to migrate to Spotify’s model serving platform, which enabled us to automate retraining and deployment of retrained models.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eAutomating feature transformations without Tensorflow Transform\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step in automating retraining is automating train dataset and test dataset curation, fetching the correct features and performing the necessary feature transformations. While feature transformations are generally handled automatically via TFT in a Kubeflow pipeline, we don’t perform our feature transformations in TFT (and therefore not in our experiment pipeline) because many the transformations we perform on the data are fairly complex and would be unnecessarily difficult to do in Tensorflow.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut because the serving platform provides feature logging, we enabled logging of \u003cem\u003ealready transformed\u003c/em\u003e features, to which we then apply the correct labels, and separate into train and test sets. These actions are all performed in scheduled pipelines that run weekly and produce weekly datasets for our models to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eMigrating from our short-term solution to a long-term solution\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to enable feature logging, we had to migrate to the new online model serving platform from our recommender service using Zoltar. It was a matter of dark loading all prediction traffic to the new deployment and then running a simple rollout to start directing traffic to our new deployment instead of using Zoltar to make predictions in our own service. This was an easy migration and provided the benefits that the online serving platform offers — feature logging, faster predictions / lower latencies, less code managed by our team — and it also supports pushing a new model version (from a Kubeflow pipeline), as opposed to constantly polling for a new model version. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eContinuous retraining and automatic deployment\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that our models are all deployed via the Spotify serving platform, it enables us to employ CI/CD. We can schedule our models to be retrained via a Kubeflow pipeline, and as part of the Kubeflow pipeline we can ensure that a “bad” model is not accidentally automatically deployed by specifying that it should: 1) check that the evaluation score is greater than our configured threshold, and 2) automatically push it to our serving infrastructure if it is greater than the threshold. This automates a lot of the processes that we had to perform manually not long ago.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnabling CI/CD for retraining and model deployment is hard, but it’s becoming easier with the new tools available and makes the quality and reliability of our models better. And at first glance, you might not think you need retraining for a model because of the task it performs, but without it, your model could make predictions in unpredictable ways and increase your tech debt.   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur ML stack has come a long way in recent years, but it’s not perfect by any means. There are still a number of challenges we are tackling — data versioning, model versioning, moving feature transformations to Tensorflow Transform — and better ways to compare offline metrics across both ML and non-ML solutions. But it has decreased the time it takes for us to iterate, experiment, and deploy quality models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have adopted and/or built the components we need to successfully and efficiently manage our data, experiment with different models, and support continuous integration and development throughout the deployment and retraining processes.

This platform could easily launch hundreds of experiments by using a configuration file to specify hyperparameters (it also supported a grid search on specified hyperparameters). And since everything that was submitted to run an experiment was a script, it supported custom evaluation metrics — something that has always been important in our team. While it provided these necessary features, it wasn’t scalable, wasn’t maintained, and had an incomplete UI. Sometimes the compute instances would lose connection with the API (via a periodic ping) and would end up being ghost workers — still running, but not connected to anything.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eHow it’s going: integration with Spotify ML ecosystem\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/12/13/the-winding-road-to-better-machine-learning-infrastructure-through-tensorflow-extended-and-kubeflow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify’s managed Kubeflow clusters\u003c/a\u003e provide a more scalable approach, modular components, and are compatible with other parts of the Spotify ML infrastructure, so it was an obvious choice to move our experimentation to this platform. Training our models using Kubeflow pipelines is easy and efficient, but running the evaluation we needed and tracking those results were our biggest pain points for two reasons: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs Spotify’s SDK for Kubeflow uses Tensorflow Model Analysis (TFMA), comparing the performance of a non-ML heuristic algorithm to that of a trained model is challenging to set up and requires extra infrastructure. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe often have custom evaluation metrics that are specific to the model’s task, but they are infinitely more difficult to implement in TFMA than in vanilla Python.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eEvaluating models against simpler (non-ML) solutions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs I alluded to in an earlier paragraph, we don’t typically start solutions to a problem with an ML solution. We first identify a heuristic, or rule-based, solution, and the most appropriate way to evaluate it.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe first step — having a baseline for comparison\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are often tasked with creating better recommendations for content X, but what are “better recommendations,” and what are they better than? Having a baseline helps answer these questions, giving us something to compare our models against. And a good baseline — usually a heuristic/rule-based solution — is a quick, efficient, but maybe not the most optimal, solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake the Shortcuts Model as an example. We created an initial heuristic that recommended, simply, the most frequently played items from a listener’s short-term listening history. We improved the heuristic over many iterations, then compared it to the performance of the models we trained. Being able to compare these heuristics to the models gave us confidence to say that having a model was an improvement over the heuristics and was worth the extra effort of maintaining, deploying, and monitoring these models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eComparing model performance to baseline performance is difficult\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter establishing our baseline and training our model(s), the difficulty lies in how we compare them evenly. In a perfect world we would run infinite A/B tests with hundreds of test cells to compare the performance of all our solutions in the real world, on real listeners. Since it’s not a perfect world, we need reliable offline metrics that act as a proxy for the online metrics we can’t get in those A/B tests.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen evaluating our recommendations models, we typically use normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG@k) as our metric, which can be implemented using Spotify’s Python SDK for Kubeflow pipelines. The question then becomes: how do we do the same for our heuristic? As we’ve mentioned before, transformation logic consistency is paramount, and so is evaluation logic — ideally, we’d have the same evaluation logic and the same evaluation test set of data. Unfortunately, our heuristics are generally written in a Java service and are tested with unit tests (not for performance).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor fairly simple heuristics, we found a way to “train a model” so that its output is the heuristic rule’s output. This allowed us to use the same evaluation and evaluation test set as the models we were comparing against. We took this same approach when coming up with a solution to recommendations in the \u003cem\u003eTry something else\u003c/em\u003e shelf for new users on Home. We computed a popularity heuristic based on a listener’s demographics in Tensorflow Transform (TFT) and used the model as a lookup utility (with a fake loss).  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can’t always fit our problem into such a simple heuristic, as was the case for Shortcuts. The logic used in most of the Shortcuts heuristics was too complex to write in Tensorflow, so we implemented a completely separate offline evaluation pipeline that would gather recommendations made by models and heuristics, and apply custom evaluation functions for comparison.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eAdding freedom and flexibility to our evaluation tools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned earlier, there’s a second pain point we run into often: using custom evaluation metrics in TFMA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eTFMA is sometimes too rigid\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify’s SDK for Kubeflow only supports evaluations using TFMA, which provides fairly basic metrics out of the box — think: precision, recall, accuracy. The most common metric we typically use is NDCG@k — TFMA provides NDCG, but not NDCG@k. Implementing metrics in TFMA is notoriously difficult; it takes ~120 lines of code to implement NDCG@k in TFMA, but only a single line of code using scikit-learn in Python.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost recently, we were experimenting with a model that predicts the next playlist that a new user will listen to, and as we have very little information about new users, we wanted to ensure that the model was not just predicting the most popular content. To do so, we were going to evaluate the model with a diversity metric that measured the difference between specific characteristics of items in each playlist. This was nearly impossible to implement in TFMA, so our team contributed to the Python SDK for Kubeflow to support any custom Python evaluation. We have been using this and running our experiments via Kubeflow pipelines since October 2020. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eCompare and track experiment results\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the pre-Kubeflow world, our experimentation platform allowed for a way to track and compare models — now, we are using Spotify’s internal UI for machine learning, as it easily integrates with our Kubeflow runs. We can view and compare the evaluation scores of our experiments — both NDCG and custom metrics — in the UI. We’ve been using this for a number of our models, and it allows us to track our model deployments as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eLooking at more than just the numbers for evaluating recommendations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve mostly mentioned what metrics we use and why they are important, but there is another incredibly useful way we evaluate our models — sometimes more useful than what a metric can reveal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eWe build custom dashboards to manually evaluate the recs\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBased on past issues, we know that evaluation metrics don’t show the whole picture of how well a model is recommending content. Sometimes, the best way to evaluate a model is by seeing what content it recommends given a specific set of features about a listener. And for this reason, our team built a dashboard that does exactly that. It loads models simply by supplying the storage location of the model, and supports comparison of multiple models given a set of features. We often test and evaluate the recommendations that a new model will provide before deploying it to production by making predictions with different sets of feature values; this gives us an intuition behind what content will be recommended to different users that have these feature values. This has helped us find glaring issues; for example, when developing and testing a new model, we found that it would recommend the same popular playlist to listeners in all European countries. Having this knowledge allowed us to fix and improve the model before deploying it to production.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost recently, we have been working on a new model to recommend albums a listener might like based on their locality and what they like to listen to. We have been running experiments comparing evaluation metric values, but we have also been looking at the recommendations on our dashboard. This dashboard gives you the ability to try different features and compare the recommendations across different models — all before the models are used to recommend content to our listeners. At the beginning stages of experimentation and modeling for this project, we noticed that the same album was recommended as the first item no matter what input features (such as user’s country, followed artists, etc.) were used for testing, meaning this album would have been recommended to everyone as the first recommendation. Without this dashboard as a tool, it would have been more challenging to identify this issue and remediate it before the model went live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile our offline metrics might indicate poor performance, they don’t tell us anything about what the reason might be, whereas this dashboard can show the quality of our recommendations and is extremely useful in finding issues like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the use of task-specific custom evaluations and dashboards to show evaluation metrics and recommendations per feature set, we have been able to gain deep insight into how our models are behaving, and make our models a little less of a black box. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe struggles of automated model retraining and deployment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s dive into our last topic, which is all about maintaining models in production: retraining and automatic deployment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBut do we actually need to retrain our models?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be really nice if we could train a model once, deploy it, and then not have to do anything except monitor its online performance. Sadly, we’ve never seen this in reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eSometimes the model’s task requires frequent retraining\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince we first deployed the Podcast Model in Home, we have always had retraining set up for it — and that’s because it only recommends podcast shows that it has seen in training data. So if we didn’t retrain it, it wouldn’t recommend any newly published shows.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe rest of the time, it just becomes a tech debt monster\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut in some cases, retraining isn’t necessarily required to capture the full set of possible candidates. For the Shortcuts Model, we didn’t have retraining set up because it only recommends content that the listener has previously listened to (which is always in the serving features). But while retraining wasn’t needed for the Shortcuts Model to operate, the lack of it became one of the biggest sources of ML tech debt. We did not implement retraining for Shortcuts because it wasn’t needed for launching the feature, but have seen that it would have saved us time and effort in the long run had we invested some time in the short term. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t until many months after the launch of the model that we saw issues with the quality of recommendations in Shortcuts due to no retraining — some of the features for this model describe the type of content that a listener has listened to, like whether it’s a personalized playlist or an album, etc., and there was a recent addition of a new type of content that was introduced after the model was last trained. As a result, the model didn’t recommend this piece of content in Shortcuts. While this starts to look like the same scenario as the Podcast Model described above, we also saw issues with migrating to different tools and platforms because the model was trained using older versions of libraries.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eImplement for the short term while waiting for the long-term solution\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce upon a time, we only had that singular Podcast Model, which was used to generate batch predictions, not real-time predictions. We had a Scio pipeline that used \u003ca href=\"https://spotify.github.io/zoltar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eZoltar\u003c/a\u003e to predict podcast recommendations for all listeners, and we stored these predictions in our Bigtable instance that holds all of our content recommendations. This was a great start, but fairly inflexible when it came to when and how often we could make predictions for a given listener — and this is important because the listeners’ features could change if they listen to new content or follow new artists, which could provide better information to the model.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eBuilding a recommender service for the short term\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsequently, we built a new service to serve this model and enable online predictions. We could get fresh recommendations for a listener almost instantly, and we could get these recommendations at useful times, such as when a listener follows a new artist. While this was a great improvement to move from offline predictions to online predictions, and an important step in making a better product, we knew we were only going to be in this state for the short term. Spotify’s online serving platform was on the horizon, but not yet ready; the benefits to building a short-term less-than-optimal solution outweighed the benefits of waiting to serve online models until Spotify’s serving solution was production ready.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith that said, let’s talk about some challenges we faced in building this recommender service, such as how to refresh the local version of a deployed model. Our solution was to poll our internal storage directory every 10 minutes to check if there was a new revision of the model; if so, the service would pull the model down from where it was stored and start using that model to make predictions. Nevermind that we only retrained weekly or that there would be some state at which some machines would have the new revision of a model and others would have the older revision (although this was not something we worried about in our specific use case).  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe pain of manually deploying models\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis was really a solution to serving models online, and less of a solution to a better process of serving models. Each time we wanted to deploy a model we had to: 1) copy the model to a specific storage location, 2) manually generate a pointer in our internal storage directory for that location, and 3) add this pointer to our recommender service along with the logic to fetch and transform features for the model. If we were to retrain the model, we would have to repeat each of those steps.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, this was a cumbersome process, but because we had this short-term solution, we were able to deploy four models to production and tested many others in A/B tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eCI/CD — but make it for model training and deployment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this recommender service lived a long life of about 10 months, the next obvious step was to migrate to Spotify’s model serving platform, which enabled us to automate retraining and deployment of retrained models.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eAutomating feature transformations without Tensorflow Transform\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step in automating retraining is automating train dataset and test dataset curation, fetching the correct features and performing the necessary feature transformations. While feature transformations are generally handled automatically via TFT in a Kubeflow pipeline, we don’t perform our feature transformations in TFT (and therefore not in our experiment pipeline) because many the transformations we perform on the data are fairly complex and would be unnecessarily difficult to do in Tensorflow.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut because the serving platform provides feature logging, we enabled logging of \u003cem\u003ealready transformed\u003c/em\u003e features, to which we then apply the correct labels, and separate into train and test sets. These actions are all performed in scheduled pipelines that run weekly and produce weekly datasets for our models to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eMigrating from our short-term solution to a long-term solution\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to enable feature logging, we had to migrate to the new online model serving platform from our recommender service using Zoltar. It was a matter of dark loading all prediction traffic to the new deployment and then running a simple rollout to start directing traffic to our new deployment instead of using Zoltar to make predictions in our own service. This was an easy migration and provided the benefits that the online serving platform offers — feature logging, faster predictions / lower latencies, less code managed by our team — and it also supports pushing a new model version (from a Kubeflow pipeline), as opposed to constantly polling for a new model version. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eContinuous retraining and automatic deployment\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that our models are all deployed via the Spotify serving platform, it enables us to employ CI/CD. We can schedule our models to be retrained via a Kubeflow pipeline, and as part of the Kubeflow pipeline we can ensure that a “bad” model is not accidentally automatically deployed by specifying that it should: 1) check that the evaluation score is greater than our configured threshold, and 2) automatically push it to our serving infrastructure if it is greater than the threshold. This automates a lot of the processes that we had to perform manually not long ago.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnabling CI/CD for retraining and model deployment is hard, but it’s becoming easier with the new tools available and makes the quality and reliability of our models better. And at first glance, you might not think you need retraining for a model because of the task it performs, but without it, your model could make predictions in unpredictable ways and increase your tech debt.   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur ML stack has come a long way in recent years, but it’s not perfect by any means. There are still a number of challenges we are tackling — data versioning, model versioning, moving feature transformations to Tensorflow Transform — and better ways to compare offline metrics across both ML and non-ML solutions. But it has decreased the time it takes for us to iterate, experiment, and deploy quality models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have adopted and/or built the components we need to successfully and efficiently manage our data, experiment with different models, and support continuous integration and development throughout the deployment and retraining processes.

This platform could easily launch hundreds of experiments by using a configuration file to specify hyperparameters (it also supported a grid search on specified hyperparameters). And since everything that was submitted to run an experiment was a script, it supported custom evaluation metrics — something that has always been important in our team. While it provided these necessary features, it wasn’t scalable, wasn’t maintained, and had an incomplete UI. Sometimes the compute instances would lose connection with the API (via a periodic ping) and would end up being ghost workers — still running, but not connected to anything.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eHow it’s going: integration with Spotify ML ecosystem\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/12/13/the-winding-road-to-better-machine-learning-infrastructure-through-tensorflow-extended-and-kubeflow/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify’s managed Kubeflow clusters\u003c/a\u003e provide a more scalable approach, modular components, and are compatible with other parts of the Spotify ML infrastructure, so it was an obvious choice to move our experimentation to this platform. Training our models using Kubeflow pipelines is easy and efficient, but running the evaluation we needed and tracking those results were our biggest pain points for two reasons: \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs Spotify’s SDK for Kubeflow uses Tensorflow Model Analysis (TFMA), comparing the performance of a non-ML heuristic algorithm to that of a trained model is challenging to set up and requires extra infrastructure. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe often have custom evaluation metrics that are specific to the model’s task, but they are infinitely more difficult to implement in TFMA than in vanilla Python.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eEvaluating models against simpler (non-ML) solutions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs I alluded to in an earlier paragraph, we don’t typically start solutions to a problem with an ML solution. We first identify a heuristic, or rule-based, solution, and the most appropriate way to evaluate it.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe first step — having a baseline for comparison\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are often tasked with creating better recommendations for content X, but what are “better recommendations,” and what are they better than? Having a baseline helps answer these questions, giving us something to compare our models against. And a good baseline — usually a heuristic/rule-based solution — is a quick, efficient, but maybe not the most optimal, solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTake the Shortcuts Model as an example. We created an initial heuristic that recommended, simply, the most frequently played items from a listener’s short-term listening history. We improved the heuristic over many iterations, then compared it to the performance of the models we trained. Being able to compare these heuristics to the models gave us confidence to say that having a model was an improvement over the heuristics and was worth the extra effort of maintaining, deploying, and monitoring these models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eComparing model performance to baseline performance is difficult\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter establishing our baseline and training our model(s), the difficulty lies in how we compare them evenly. In a perfect world we would run infinite A/B tests with hundreds of test cells to compare the performance of all our solutions in the real world, on real listeners. Since it’s not a perfect world, we need reliable offline metrics that act as a proxy for the online metrics we can’t get in those A/B tests.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen evaluating our recommendations models, we typically use normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG@k) as our metric, which can be implemented using Spotify’s Python SDK for Kubeflow pipelines. The question then becomes: how do we do the same for our heuristic? As we’ve mentioned before, transformation logic consistency is paramount, and so is evaluation logic — ideally, we’d have the same evaluation logic and the same evaluation test set of data. Unfortunately, our heuristics are generally written in a Java service and are tested with unit tests (not for performance).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor fairly simple heuristics, we found a way to “train a model” so that its output is the heuristic rule’s output. This allowed us to use the same evaluation and evaluation test set as the models we were comparing against. We took this same approach when coming up with a solution to recommendations in the \u003cem\u003eTry something else\u003c/em\u003e shelf for new users on Home. We computed a popularity heuristic based on a listener’s demographics in Tensorflow Transform (TFT) and used the model as a lookup utility (with a fake loss).  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe can’t always fit our problem into such a simple heuristic, as was the case for Shortcuts. The logic used in most of the Shortcuts heuristics was too complex to write in Tensorflow, so we implemented a completely separate offline evaluation pipeline that would gather recommendations made by models and heuristics, and apply custom evaluation functions for comparison.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eAdding freedom and flexibility to our evaluation tools\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned earlier, there’s a second pain point we run into often: using custom evaluation metrics in TFMA.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eTFMA is sometimes too rigid\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify’s SDK for Kubeflow only supports evaluations using TFMA, which provides fairly basic metrics out of the box — think: precision, recall, accuracy. The most common metric we typically use is NDCG@k — TFMA provides NDCG, but not NDCG@k. Implementing metrics in TFMA is notoriously difficult; it takes ~120 lines of code to implement NDCG@k in TFMA, but only a single line of code using scikit-learn in Python.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost recently, we were experimenting with a model that predicts the next playlist that a new user will listen to, and as we have very little information about new users, we wanted to ensure that the model was not just predicting the most popular content. To do so, we were going to evaluate the model with a diversity metric that measured the difference between specific characteristics of items in each playlist. This was nearly impossible to implement in TFMA, so our team contributed to the Python SDK for Kubeflow to support any custom Python evaluation. We have been using this and running our experiments via Kubeflow pipelines since October 2020. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eCompare and track experiment results\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the pre-Kubeflow world, our experimentation platform allowed for a way to track and compare models — now, we are using Spotify’s internal UI for machine learning, as it easily integrates with our Kubeflow runs. We can view and compare the evaluation scores of our experiments — both NDCG and custom metrics — in the UI. We’ve been using this for a number of our models, and it allows us to track our model deployments as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eLooking at more than just the numbers for evaluating recommendations\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI’ve mostly mentioned what metrics we use and why they are important, but there is another incredibly useful way we evaluate our models — sometimes more useful than what a metric can reveal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eWe build custom dashboards to manually evaluate the recs\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBased on past issues, we know that evaluation metrics don’t show the whole picture of how well a model is recommending content. Sometimes, the best way to evaluate a model is by seeing what content it recommends given a specific set of features about a listener. And for this reason, our team built a dashboard that does exactly that. It loads models simply by supplying the storage location of the model, and supports comparison of multiple models given a set of features. We often test and evaluate the recommendations that a new model will provide before deploying it to production by making predictions with different sets of feature values; this gives us an intuition behind what content will be recommended to different users that have these feature values. This has helped us find glaring issues; for example, when developing and testing a new model, we found that it would recommend the same popular playlist to listeners in all European countries. Having this knowledge allowed us to fix and improve the model before deploying it to production.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost recently, we have been working on a new model to recommend albums a listener might like based on their locality and what they like to listen to. We have been running experiments comparing evaluation metric values, but we have also been looking at the recommendations on our dashboard. This dashboard gives you the ability to try different features and compare the recommendations across different models — all before the models are used to recommend content to our listeners. At the beginning stages of experimentation and modeling for this project, we noticed that the same album was recommended as the first item no matter what input features (such as user’s country, followed artists, etc.) were used for testing, meaning this album would have been recommended to everyone as the first recommendation. Without this dashboard as a tool, it would have been more challenging to identify this issue and remediate it before the model went live.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile our offline metrics might indicate poor performance, they don’t tell us anything about what the reason might be, whereas this dashboard can show the quality of our recommendations and is extremely useful in finding issues like this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThrough the use of task-specific custom evaluations and dashboards to show evaluation metrics and recommendations per feature set, we have been able to gain deep insight into how our models are behaving, and make our models a little less of a black box. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe struggles of automated model retraining and deployment\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s dive into our last topic, which is all about maintaining models in production: retraining and automatic deployment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBut do we actually need to retrain our models?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt would be really nice if we could train a model once, deploy it, and then not have to do anything except monitor its online performance. Sadly, we’ve never seen this in reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eSometimes the model’s task requires frequent retraining\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince we first deployed the Podcast Model in Home, we have always had retraining set up for it — and that’s because it only recommends podcast shows that it has seen in training data. So if we didn’t retrain it, it wouldn’t recommend any newly published shows.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe rest of the time, it just becomes a tech debt monster\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut in some cases, retraining isn’t necessarily required to capture the full set of possible candidates. For the Shortcuts Model, we didn’t have retraining set up because it only recommends content that the listener has previously listened to (which is always in the serving features). But while retraining wasn’t needed for the Shortcuts Model to operate, the lack of it became one of the biggest sources of ML tech debt. We did not implement retraining for Shortcuts because it wasn’t needed for launching the feature, but have seen that it would have saved us time and effort in the long run had we invested some time in the short term. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t until many months after the launch of the model that we saw issues with the quality of recommendations in Shortcuts due to no retraining — some of the features for this model describe the type of content that a listener has listened to, like whether it’s a personalized playlist or an album, etc., and there was a recent addition of a new type of content that was introduced after the model was last trained. As a result, the model didn’t recommend this piece of content in Shortcuts. While this starts to look like the same scenario as the Podcast Model described above, we also saw issues with migrating to different tools and platforms because the model was trained using older versions of libraries.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eImplement for the short term while waiting for the long-term solution\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce upon a time, we only had that singular Podcast Model, which was used to generate batch predictions, not real-time predictions. We had a Scio pipeline that used \u003ca href=\"https://spotify.github.io/zoltar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eZoltar\u003c/a\u003e to predict podcast recommendations for all listeners, and we stored these predictions in our Bigtable instance that holds all of our content recommendations. This was a great start, but fairly inflexible when it came to when and how often we could make predictions for a given listener — and this is important because the listeners’ features could change if they listen to new content or follow new artists, which could provide better information to the model.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eBuilding a recommender service for the short term\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsequently, we built a new service to serve this model and enable online predictions. We could get fresh recommendations for a listener almost instantly, and we could get these recommendations at useful times, such as when a listener follows a new artist. While this was a great improvement to move from offline predictions to online predictions, and an important step in making a better product, we knew we were only going to be in this state for the short term. Spotify’s online serving platform was on the horizon, but not yet ready; the benefits to building a short-term less-than-optimal solution outweighed the benefits of waiting to serve online models until Spotify’s serving solution was production ready.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith that said, let’s talk about some challenges we faced in building this recommender service, such as how to refresh the local version of a deployed model. Our solution was to poll our internal storage directory every 10 minutes to check if there was a new revision of the model; if so, the service would pull the model down from where it was stored and start using that model to make predictions. Nevermind that we only retrained weekly or that there would be some state at which some machines would have the new revision of a model and others would have the older revision (although this was not something we worried about in our specific use case).  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eThe pain of manually deploying models\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis was really a solution to serving models online, and less of a solution to a better process of serving models. Each time we wanted to deploy a model we had to: 1) copy the model to a specific storage location, 2) manually generate a pointer in our internal storage directory for that location, and 3) add this pointer to our recommender service along with the logic to fetch and transform features for the model. If we were to retrain the model, we would have to repeat each of those steps.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eObviously, this was a cumbersome process, but because we had this short-term solution, we were able to deploy four models to production and tested many others in A/B tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eCI/CD — but make it for model training and deployment\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this recommender service lived a long life of about 10 months, the next obvious step was to migrate to Spotify’s model serving platform, which enabled us to automate retraining and deployment of retrained models.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eAutomating feature transformations without Tensorflow Transform\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe first step in automating retraining is automating train dataset and test dataset curation, fetching the correct features and performing the necessary feature transformations. While feature transformations are generally handled automatically via TFT in a Kubeflow pipeline, we don’t perform our feature transformations in TFT (and therefore not in our experiment pipeline) because many the transformations we perform on the data are fairly complex and would be unnecessarily difficult to do in Tensorflow.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut because the serving platform provides feature logging, we enabled logging of \u003cem\u003ealready transformed\u003c/em\u003e features, to which we then apply the correct labels, and separate into train and test sets. These actions are all performed in scheduled pipelines that run weekly and produce weekly datasets for our models to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eMigrating from our short-term solution to a long-term solution\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to enable feature logging, we had to migrate to the new online model serving platform from our recommender service using Zoltar. It was a matter of dark loading all prediction traffic to the new deployment and then running a simple rollout to start directing traffic to our new deployment instead of using Zoltar to make predictions in our own service. This was an easy migration and provided the benefits that the online serving platform offers — feature logging, faster predictions / lower latencies, less code managed by our team — and it also supports pushing a new model version (from a Kubeflow pipeline), as opposed to constantly polling for a new model version. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eContinuous retraining and automatic deployment\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that our models are all deployed via the Spotify serving platform, it enables us to employ CI/CD. We can schedule our models to be retrained via a Kubeflow pipeline, and as part of the Kubeflow pipeline we can ensure that a “bad” model is not accidentally automatically deployed by specifying that it should: 1) check that the evaluation score is greater than our configured threshold, and 2) automatically push it to our serving infrastructure if it is greater than the threshold. This automates a lot of the processes that we had to perform manually not long ago.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnabling CI/CD for retraining and model deployment is hard, but it’s becoming easier with the new tools available and makes the quality and reliability of our models better. And at first glance, you might not think you need retraining for a model because of the task it performs, but without it, your model could make predictions in unpredictable ways and increase your tech debt.   \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur ML stack has come a long way in recent years, but it’s not perfect by any means. There are still a number of challenges we are tackling — data versioning, model versioning, moving feature transformations to Tensorflow Transform — and better ways to compare offline metrics across both ML and non-ML solutions. But it has decreased the time it takes for us to iterate, experiment, and deploy quality models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have adopted and/or built the components we need to successfully and efficiently manage our data, experiment with different models, and support continuous integration and development throughout the deployment and retraining processes.

As long as all input files and compilation parameters are the same, instead of building a target locally, one can download artifacts that were built and shared from some other machine. A key success factor for remote caching is finding an optimal caching level. Caching units that are too granular, where every single piece of the compilation step is cacheable, may lead to extensive network traffic overhead, which can offset CPU savings. On the other hand, putting the entire codebase into a single cacheable unit may significantly degrade the caching hit rate; every single local change invalidates remotely available cache artifacts, triggering a full build, locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main Spotify iOS application is highly modularized and contains more than 400 independent modules configured as separate Xcode targets. Applying target-level caching was natural, and as we found out later, the right decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDesigning the remote cache solution \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the design phase, our aim was to come up with a solution generic enough that it could be applied to a broad range of iOS applications with minimal or no project changes. That was an ambitious goal given how the Xcode build system works. Before going straight to the applied solution, let’s consider how an Xcode build actually works. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does XCRemoteCache work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, all caching mechanisms use a fingerprint of input files to recognize if build products can be reused. However, finding a precise set of these files is a nontrivial task. The Xcode build system is very liberal when it comes to dependency attribution. It tries to optimistically find a definition of the dependency (header files, \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e, etc.) in all available search paths — provided either by the developer in the Xcode project settings or in the current build product directory. As a result, developers don’t have to explicitly specify all dependencies a target uses, but just have to make sure that those dependencies will be placed in a correct location \u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e Xcode actually needs them. The fact that compilers are able to implicitly find required dependencies, hinders the simple fingerprint generation by hashing all available files in header and framework search paths — a list of files to consider in the fingerprinting would often be too broad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, we observed that Xcode works quite well for local incremental builds and executes only a narrow subset of steps that were affected since the last build. In other words, the Xcode build system knows which files are the actual input files for the compilation, but that list is generated as compiler’s output (.d files) and is not available ahead of a compilation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eXCRemoteCache applies a unique approach to automatically identify all input files of the compilation based on Git history and dependency lists provided as a compilation output. The generation side, called \u003cem\u003eproducer mode\u003c/em\u003e, along with the compilation product, also uploads a meta file. That file contains a list of all compilation files the compiler used and the full SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) commit identifier it was built against. The producer mode should run on CI for each primary branch (like \u003ccode\u003emaster\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003edevelop\u003c/code\u003e) commit, as a part of the post-merge phase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the consumer side (aka \u003cem\u003econsumer mode\u003c/em\u003e), XCRemoteCache finds the most recent history commit for which the remote server contains build artifacts and builds a fingerprint based on input files provided in the meta file. Let’s imagine two developers, \u003ccode\u003eA\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eB\u003c/code\u003e, working on their local branches \u003ccode\u003efeatureA \u003c/code\u003eand \u003ccode\u003efeatureB\u003c/code\u003e, branching out from \u003ccode\u003emaster \u003c/code\u003eon \u003ccode\u003eCommit1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eCommit3\u003c/code\u003e, respectively (Figure 2). A CI job that produces and uploads cache artifacts to the central server finished its work only for commits 1, 2, and 4. For some reason, \u003ccode\u003eCommit3\u003c/code\u003e artifacts are not ready — either the build is in progress or it has failed. Developer A’s machine will reuse the artifacts generated for \u003ccode\u003eCommit1\u003c/code\u003e, while Developer B’s takes them from \u003ccode\u003eCommit2\u003c/code\u003e — it tried with \u003ccode\u003eCommit3\u003c/code\u003e, but they are not ready yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts-700x440.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts-700x440.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts-250x157.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts-768x483.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts-120x75.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts.png 1205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 2: Finding a commit with artifacts to reuse.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that procedure, XCRemoteCache gets a strict list of input files almost for free.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAssuming we have an app split into several independent targets and local branches that don’t divert much from a primary branch, the caching hit rate will be high, minus only these targets that contain changes comparing the commit of which remote artifacts are used. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBuild artifacts portability\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother problem to consider is “build artifacts portability” between multiple machines. Several types of compilation output files include absolute paths, so for full compatibility, some kind of normalization is required. For iOS projects, such a step is required for \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e files and debug symbols. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eProjects cloned to \u003ccode\u003e/dir1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e/dir2\u003c/code\u003e generate \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule \u003c/code\u003efiles that do not match on a byte level. Swiftmodule represents an inter-module API (Swift counterparts to .h) that can be included in the list of fingerprinting files. To overcome falsy cache misses if two machines don’t have the same absolute source root paths, XCRemoteCache carries an extra fingerprint file (called a fingerprint override) next to the \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule \u003c/code\u003ethat includes a fingerprint of all the files used in the compilation step. A fingerprint override is path agnostic, so contrary to the \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e file, it can be used as a byte-level stable fingerprint of a Swift target. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDebug symbols, other path-sensitive files, are appended to the binary package to associate the machine code with the corresponding source location when debugging. The XCRemoteCache leverages support for LLDB runtime path rewrites using \u003ccode\u003esettings set target.source-map\u003c/code\u003e. Both producer and consumer pass \u003ccode\u003edebug-prefix-map\u003c/code\u003e parameters to the Swift and Clang compilers to align the source root of all debug symbols making the LLDB source mapping a simple, single-line command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Spotify story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify, we have fast, well-optimized CI jobs that no longer slow down our development feedback loop (please head to \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/05/01/how-we-gave-superpowers-to-our-macos-ci/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eHow We Gave Superpowers to Our macOS CI\u003c/a\u003e to read more about that), so we focused on applying XCRemoteCache on local machines. Keep in mind that the tool is able to work on CI machines and accelerate PR jobs, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn controlled conditions, XCRemoteCache was able to cut the very first iOS Spotify application build time by 85%. This was a great achievement, but in practice, developers introduce changes locally, and some targets have to be compiled locally. Our goal was to evaluate real-world scenarios to understand their true impact. To estimate that, we rolled out the remote cache to 50% of our developers for a week and compared all build metrics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eResults exceeded our expectations — we observed a huge improvement of the local build times: \u003cstrong\u003emedian clean build and incremental build times decreased by 70% and 6%, respectively. \u003c/strong\u003eWe classify builds as \u003cem\u003eclean\u003c/em\u003e when at least 50% of all targets compile at least one file.  Other builds that compile at least one file are \u003cem\u003eincremental\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, we enabled XCRemoteCache into our main application more than a year ago, and since then, it has worked flawlessly. We get very positive feedback from our developers and, as a side effect, we’ve seen the portion of clean builds almost double compared to the pre-remote cache times. Developers nowadays are twice more likely to rebase their working branches, eventually leading to fewer conflicts when creating a pull request. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to integrate XCRemoteCache into your existing project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that XCRemoteCache is open source, you can apply it to your own project with minimum effort. It supports multiple project setups, including the ones managed by CocoaPods, Carthage, or any other custom dependency management. Keep in mind, though, that for best results, your project should be split into several targets or you risk frequent cache invalidations, as described above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor seamless integration, we are open sourcing a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spotify/XCRemoteCache/tree/master/cocoapods-plugin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eCocoaPods plugin\u003c/a\u003e and provide an automated script to modify the existing .xcodeproj project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eXCRemoteCache works with any HTTP server that supports PUT, HEAD, and GET requests.

We tried to cover most of the common scenarios but, keeping in mind that Xcode projects may have very custom setups, some of them may not be compatible right now. Therefore, any inputs from the community, both raising issues or pull requests, are very welcome.

As the name suggests, this library is a remote caching implementation for iOS projects with an aim to reuse Xcode target artifacts generated on Continuous Integration (CI) machines. It supports Objective-C, Swift, and ObjC+Swift targets and can be easily integrated with existing Xcode projects, including ones managed by CocoaPods or Carthage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBest of all, XCRemoteCache resulted in a \u003cstrong\u003e70% decrease in clean build times\u003c/strong\u003e (we classify a build as \u003cem\u003eclean\u003c/em\u003e when at least 50% of all targets compile at least one file).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackground\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsing our Xcode build metrics (for more details on how this works, take a look at our open source \u003ca href=\"https://xcmetrics.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eXCMetrics project\u003c/a\u003e), we found out that it often takes our developers more than 10 minutes to build the main Spotify iOS application.

As long as all input files and compilation parameters are the same, instead of building a target locally, one can download artifacts that were built and shared from some other machine. A key success factor for remote caching is finding an optimal caching level. Caching units that are too granular, where every single piece of the compilation step is cacheable, may lead to extensive network traffic overhead, which can offset CPU savings. On the other hand, putting the entire codebase into a single cacheable unit may significantly degrade the caching hit rate; every single local change invalidates remotely available cache artifacts, triggering a full build, locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main Spotify iOS application is highly modularized and contains more than 400 independent modules configured as separate Xcode targets. Applying target-level caching was natural, and as we found out later, the right decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDesigning the remote cache solution \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the design phase, our aim was to come up with a solution generic enough that it could be applied to a broad range of iOS applications with minimal or no project changes. That was an ambitious goal given how the Xcode build system works. Before going straight to the applied solution, let’s consider how an Xcode build actually works. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does XCRemoteCache work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, all caching mechanisms use a fingerprint of input files to recognize if build products can be reused. However, finding a precise set of these files is a nontrivial task. The Xcode build system is very liberal when it comes to dependency attribution. It tries to optimistically find a definition of the dependency (header files, \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e, etc.) in all available search paths — provided either by the developer in the Xcode project settings or in the current build product directory. As a result, developers don’t have to explicitly specify all dependencies a target uses, but just have to make sure that those dependencies will be placed in a correct location \u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e Xcode actually needs them. The fact that compilers are able to implicitly find required dependencies, hinders the simple fingerprint generation by hashing all available files in header and framework search paths — a list of files to consider in the fingerprinting would often be too broad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, we observed that Xcode works quite well for local incremental builds and executes only a narrow subset of steps that were affected since the last build. In other words, the Xcode build system knows which files are the actual input files for the compilation, but that list is generated as compiler’s output (.d files) and is not available ahead of a compilation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eXCRemoteCache applies a unique approach to automatically identify all input files of the compilation based on Git history and dependency lists provided as a compilation output. The generation side, called \u003cem\u003eproducer mode\u003c/em\u003e, along with the compilation product, also uploads a meta file. That file contains a list of all compilation files the compiler used and the full SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) commit identifier it was built against. The producer mode should run on CI for each primary branch (like \u003ccode\u003emaster\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003edevelop\u003c/code\u003e) commit, as a part of the post-merge phase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the consumer side (aka \u003cem\u003econsumer mode\u003c/em\u003e), XCRemoteCache finds the most recent history commit for which the remote server contains build artifacts and builds a fingerprint based on input files provided in the meta file. Let’s imagine two developers, \u003ccode\u003eA\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eB\u003c/code\u003e, working on their local branches \u003ccode\u003efeatureA \u003c/code\u003eand \u003ccode\u003efeatureB\u003c/code\u003e, branching out from \u003ccode\u003emaster \u003c/code\u003eon \u003ccode\u003eCommit1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eCommit3\u003c/code\u003e, respectively (Figure 2). A CI job that produces and uploads cache artifacts to the central server finished its work only for commits 1, 2, and 4. For some reason, \u003ccode\u003eCommit3\u003c/code\u003e artifacts are not ready — either the build is in progress or it has failed. Developer A’s machine will reuse the artifacts generated for \u003ccode\u003eCommit1\u003c/code\u003e, while Developer B’s takes them from \u003ccode\u003eCommit2\u003c/code\u003e — it tried with \u003ccode\u003eCommit3\u003c/code\u003e, but they are not ready yet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"440\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts-700x440.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts-700x440.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts-250x157.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts-768x483.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts-120x75.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Commit_Artifacts.png 1205w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 2: Finding a commit with artifacts to reuse.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that procedure, XCRemoteCache gets a strict list of input files almost for free.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAssuming we have an app split into several independent targets and local branches that don’t divert much from a primary branch, the caching hit rate will be high, minus only these targets that contain changes comparing the commit of which remote artifacts are used. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBuild artifacts portability\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother problem to consider is “build artifacts portability” between multiple machines. Several types of compilation output files include absolute paths, so for full compatibility, some kind of normalization is required. For iOS projects, such a step is required for \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e files and debug symbols. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eProjects cloned to \u003ccode\u003e/dir1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e/dir2\u003c/code\u003e generate \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule \u003c/code\u003efiles that do not match on a byte level. Swiftmodule represents an inter-module API (Swift counterparts to .h) that can be included in the list of fingerprinting files. To overcome falsy cache misses if two machines don’t have the same absolute source root paths, XCRemoteCache carries an extra fingerprint file (called a fingerprint override) next to the \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule \u003c/code\u003ethat includes a fingerprint of all the files used in the compilation step. A fingerprint override is path agnostic, so contrary to the \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e file, it can be used as a byte-level stable fingerprint of a Swift target. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDebug symbols, other path-sensitive files, are appended to the binary package to associate the machine code with the corresponding source location when debugging. The XCRemoteCache leverages support for LLDB runtime path rewrites using \u003ccode\u003esettings set target.source-map\u003c/code\u003e. Both producer and consumer pass \u003ccode\u003edebug-prefix-map\u003c/code\u003e parameters to the Swift and Clang compilers to align the source root of all debug symbols making the LLDB source mapping a simple, single-line command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Spotify story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify, we have fast, well-optimized CI jobs that no longer slow down our development feedback loop (please head to \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/05/01/how-we-gave-superpowers-to-our-macos-ci/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eHow We Gave Superpowers to Our macOS CI\u003c/a\u003e to read more about that), so we focused on applying XCRemoteCache on local machines. Keep in mind that the tool is able to work on CI machines and accelerate PR jobs, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn controlled conditions, XCRemoteCache was able to cut the very first iOS Spotify application build time by 85%. This was a great achievement, but in practice, developers introduce changes locally, and some targets have to be compiled locally. Our goal was to evaluate real-world scenarios to understand their true impact. To estimate that, we rolled out the remote cache to 50% of our developers for a week and compared all build metrics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eResults exceeded our expectations — we observed a huge improvement of the local build times: \u003cstrong\u003emedian clean build and incremental build times decreased by 70% and 6%, respectively. \u003c/strong\u003eWe classify builds as \u003cem\u003eclean\u003c/em\u003e when at least 50% of all targets compile at least one file.  Other builds that compile at least one file are \u003cem\u003eincremental\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, we enabled XCRemoteCache into our main application more than a year ago, and since then, it has worked flawlessly. We get very positive feedback from our developers and, as a side effect, we’ve seen the portion of clean builds almost double compared to the pre-remote cache times. Developers nowadays are twice more likely to rebase their working branches, eventually leading to fewer conflicts when creating a pull request. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to integrate XCRemoteCache into your existing project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that XCRemoteCache is open source, you can apply it to your own project with minimum effort. It supports multiple project setups, including the ones managed by CocoaPods, Carthage, or any other custom dependency management. Keep in mind, though, that for best results, your project should be split into several targets or you risk frequent cache invalidations, as described above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor seamless integration, we are open sourcing a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spotify/XCRemoteCache/tree/master/cocoapods-plugin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eCocoaPods plugin\u003c/a\u003e and provide an automated script to modify the existing .xcodeproj project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eXCRemoteCache works with any HTTP server that supports PUT, HEAD, and GET requests.

We tried to cover most of the common scenarios but, keeping in mind that Xcode projects may have very custom setups, some of them may not be compatible right now. Therefore, any inputs from the community, both raising issues or pull requests, are very welcome.

As the name suggests, this library is a remote caching implementation for iOS projects with an aim to reuse Xcode target artifacts generated on Continuous Integration (CI) machines. It supports Objective-C, Swift, and ObjC+Swift targets and can be easily integrated with existing Xcode projects, including ones managed by CocoaPods or Carthage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBest of all, XCRemoteCache resulted in a \u003cstrong\u003e70% decrease in clean build times\u003c/strong\u003e (we classify a build as \u003cem\u003eclean\u003c/em\u003e when at least 50% of all targets compile at least one file).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackground\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsing our Xcode build metrics (for more details on how this works, take a look at our open source \u003ca href=\"https://xcmetrics.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eXCMetrics project\u003c/a\u003e), we found out that it often takes our developers more than 10 minutes to build the main Spotify iOS application. Even though the number of these builds is relatively small (less than 3% of all builds), they take more than 50% of global building times (Figure 1). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some investigation, it was revealed that long-lasting builds usually happen after rebasing or merging remote branches.

As long as all input files and compilation parameters are the same, instead of building a target locally, one can download artifacts that were built and shared from some other machine. A key success factor for remote caching is finding an optimal caching level. Caching units that are too granular, where every single piece of the compilation step is cacheable, may lead to extensive network traffic overhead, which can offset CPU savings. On the other hand, putting the entire codebase into a single cacheable unit may significantly degrade the caching hit rate; every single local change invalidates remotely available cache artifacts, triggering a full build, locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main Spotify iOS application is highly modularized and contains more than 400 independent modules configured as separate Xcode targets. Applying target-level caching was natural, and as we found out later, the right decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDesigning the remote cache solution \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the design phase, our aim was to come up with a solution generic enough that it could be applied to a broad range of iOS applications with minimal or no project changes. That was an ambitious goal given how the Xcode build system works. Before going straight to the applied solution, let’s consider how an Xcode build actually works. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does XCRemoteCache work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, all caching mechanisms use a fingerprint of input files to recognize if build products can be reused. However, finding a precise set of these files is a nontrivial task. The Xcode build system is very liberal when it comes to dependency attribution. It tries to optimistically find a definition of the dependency (header files, \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e, etc.) in all available search paths — provided either by the developer in the Xcode project settings or in the current build product directory. As a result, developers don’t have to explicitly specify all dependencies a target uses, but just have to make sure that those dependencies will be placed in a correct location \u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e Xcode actually needs them. The fact that compilers are able to implicitly find required dependencies, hinders the simple fingerprint generation by hashing all available files in header and framework search paths — a list of files to consider in the fingerprinting would often be too broad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, we observed that Xcode works quite well for local incremental builds and executes only a narrow subset of steps that were affected since the last build. In other words, the Xcode build system knows which files are the actual input files for the compilation, but that list is generated as compiler’s output (.d files) and is not available ahead of a compilation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eXCRemoteCache applies a unique approach to automatically identify all input files of the compilation based on Git history and dependency lists provided as a compilation output. The generation side, called \u003cem\u003eproducer mode\u003c/em\u003e, along with the compilation product, also uploads a meta file. That file contains a list of all compilation files the compiler used and the full SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) commit identifier it was built against. The producer mode should run on CI for each primary branch (like \u003ccode\u003emaster\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003edevelop\u003c/code\u003e) commit, as a part of the post-merge phase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the consumer side (aka \u003cem\u003econsumer mode\u003c/em\u003e), XCRemoteCache finds the most recent history commit for which the remote server contains build artifacts and builds a fingerprint based on input files provided in the meta file. Let’s imagine two developers, \u003ccode\u003eA\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eB\u003c/code\u003e, working on their local branches \u003ccode\u003efeatureA \u003c/code\u003eand \u003ccode\u003efeatureB\u003c/code\u003e, branching out from \u003ccode\u003emaster \u003c/code\u003eon \u003ccode\u003eCommit1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eCommit3\u003c/code\u003e, respectively (Figure 2).

Several types of compilation output files include absolute paths, so for full compatibility, some kind of normalization is required. For iOS projects, such a step is required for \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e files and debug symbols. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eProjects cloned to \u003ccode\u003e/dir1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e/dir2\u003c/code\u003e generate \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule \u003c/code\u003efiles that do not match on a byte level. Swiftmodule represents an inter-module API (Swift counterparts to .h) that can be included in the list of fingerprinting files. To overcome falsy cache misses if two machines don’t have the same absolute source root paths, XCRemoteCache carries an extra fingerprint file (called a fingerprint override) next to the \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule \u003c/code\u003ethat includes a fingerprint of all the files used in the compilation step. A fingerprint override is path agnostic, so contrary to the \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e file, it can be used as a byte-level stable fingerprint of a Swift target. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDebug symbols, other path-sensitive files, are appended to the binary package to associate the machine code with the corresponding source location when debugging. The XCRemoteCache leverages support for LLDB runtime path rewrites using \u003ccode\u003esettings set target.source-map\u003c/code\u003e. Both producer and consumer pass \u003ccode\u003edebug-prefix-map\u003c/code\u003e parameters to the Swift and Clang compilers to align the source root of all debug symbols making the LLDB source mapping a simple, single-line command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Spotify story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify, we have fast, well-optimized CI jobs that no longer slow down our development feedback loop (please head to \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/05/01/how-we-gave-superpowers-to-our-macos-ci/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eHow We Gave Superpowers to Our macOS CI\u003c/a\u003e to read more about that), so we focused on applying XCRemoteCache on local machines. Keep in mind that the tool is able to work on CI machines and accelerate PR jobs, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn controlled conditions, XCRemoteCache was able to cut the very first iOS Spotify application build time by 85%. This was a great achievement, but in practice, developers introduce changes locally, and some targets have to be compiled locally. Our goal was to evaluate real-world scenarios to understand their true impact. To estimate that, we rolled out the remote cache to 50% of our developers for a week and compared all build metrics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eResults exceeded our expectations — we observed a huge improvement of the local build times: \u003cstrong\u003emedian clean build and incremental build times decreased by 70% and 6%, respectively. \u003c/strong\u003eWe classify builds as \u003cem\u003eclean\u003c/em\u003e when at least 50% of all targets compile at least one file.  Other builds that compile at least one file are \u003cem\u003eincremental\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, we enabled XCRemoteCache into our main application more than a year ago, and since then, it has worked flawlessly. We get very positive feedback from our developers and, as a side effect, we’ve seen the portion of clean builds almost double compared to the pre-remote cache times. Developers nowadays are twice more likely to rebase their working branches, eventually leading to fewer conflicts when creating a pull request. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to integrate XCRemoteCache into your existing project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that XCRemoteCache is open source, you can apply it to your own project with minimum effort. It supports multiple project setups, including the ones managed by CocoaPods, Carthage, or any other custom dependency management. Keep in mind, though, that for best results, your project should be split into several targets or you risk frequent cache invalidations, as described above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor seamless integration, we are open sourcing a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spotify/XCRemoteCache/tree/master/cocoapods-plugin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eCocoaPods plugin\u003c/a\u003e and provide an automated script to modify the existing .xcodeproj project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eXCRemoteCache works with any HTTP server that supports PUT, HEAD, and GET requests.

We tried to cover most of the common scenarios but, keeping in mind that Xcode projects may have very custom setups, some of them may not be compatible right now. Therefore, any inputs from the community, both raising issues or pull requests, are very welcome.

As the name suggests, this library is a remote caching implementation for iOS projects with an aim to reuse Xcode target artifacts generated on Continuous Integration (CI) machines. It supports Objective-C, Swift, and ObjC+Swift targets and can be easily integrated with existing Xcode projects, including ones managed by CocoaPods or Carthage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBest of all, XCRemoteCache resulted in a \u003cstrong\u003e70% decrease in clean build times\u003c/strong\u003e (we classify a build as \u003cem\u003eclean\u003c/em\u003e when at least 50% of all targets compile at least one file).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBackground\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUsing our Xcode build metrics (for more details on how this works, take a look at our open source \u003ca href=\"https://xcmetrics.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eXCMetrics project\u003c/a\u003e), we found out that it often takes our developers more than 10 minutes to build the main Spotify iOS application. Even though the number of these builds is relatively small (less than 3% of all builds), they take more than 50% of global building times (Figure 1). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some investigation, it was revealed that long-lasting builds usually happen after rebasing or merging remote branches.

As long as all input files and compilation parameters are the same, instead of building a target locally, one can download artifacts that were built and shared from some other machine. A key success factor for remote caching is finding an optimal caching level. Caching units that are too granular, where every single piece of the compilation step is cacheable, may lead to extensive network traffic overhead, which can offset CPU savings. On the other hand, putting the entire codebase into a single cacheable unit may significantly degrade the caching hit rate; every single local change invalidates remotely available cache artifacts, triggering a full build, locally.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main Spotify iOS application is highly modularized and contains more than 400 independent modules configured as separate Xcode targets. Applying target-level caching was natural, and as we found out later, the right decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDesigning the remote cache solution \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the design phase, our aim was to come up with a solution generic enough that it could be applied to a broad range of iOS applications with minimal or no project changes. That was an ambitious goal given how the Xcode build system works. Before going straight to the applied solution, let’s consider how an Xcode build actually works. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does XCRemoteCache work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, all caching mechanisms use a fingerprint of input files to recognize if build products can be reused. However, finding a precise set of these files is a nontrivial task. The Xcode build system is very liberal when it comes to dependency attribution. It tries to optimistically find a definition of the dependency (header files, \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e, etc.) in all available search paths — provided either by the developer in the Xcode project settings or in the current build product directory. As a result, developers don’t have to explicitly specify all dependencies a target uses, but just have to make sure that those dependencies will be placed in a correct location \u003cem\u003ebefore\u003c/em\u003e Xcode actually needs them. The fact that compilers are able to implicitly find required dependencies, hinders the simple fingerprint generation by hashing all available files in header and framework search paths — a list of files to consider in the fingerprinting would often be too broad.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, we observed that Xcode works quite well for local incremental builds and executes only a narrow subset of steps that were affected since the last build. In other words, the Xcode build system knows which files are the actual input files for the compilation, but that list is generated as compiler’s output (.d files) and is not available ahead of a compilation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eXCRemoteCache applies a unique approach to automatically identify all input files of the compilation based on Git history and dependency lists provided as a compilation output. The generation side, called \u003cem\u003eproducer mode\u003c/em\u003e, along with the compilation product, also uploads a meta file. That file contains a list of all compilation files the compiler used and the full SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) commit identifier it was built against. The producer mode should run on CI for each primary branch (like \u003ccode\u003emaster\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003edevelop\u003c/code\u003e) commit, as a part of the post-merge phase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the consumer side (aka \u003cem\u003econsumer mode\u003c/em\u003e), XCRemoteCache finds the most recent history commit for which the remote server contains build artifacts and builds a fingerprint based on input files provided in the meta file. Let’s imagine two developers, \u003ccode\u003eA\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eB\u003c/code\u003e, working on their local branches \u003ccode\u003efeatureA \u003c/code\u003eand \u003ccode\u003efeatureB\u003c/code\u003e, branching out from \u003ccode\u003emaster \u003c/code\u003eon \u003ccode\u003eCommit1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eCommit3\u003c/code\u003e, respectively (Figure 2). A CI job that produces and uploads cache artifacts to the central server finished its work only for commits 1, 2, and 4. For some reason, \u003ccode\u003eCommit3\u003c/code\u003e artifacts are not ready — either the build is in progress or it has failed.

For iOS projects, such a step is required for \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e files and debug symbols. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eProjects cloned to \u003ccode\u003e/dir1\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e/dir2\u003c/code\u003e generate \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule \u003c/code\u003efiles that do not match on a byte level. Swiftmodule represents an inter-module API (Swift counterparts to .h) that can be included in the list of fingerprinting files. To overcome falsy cache misses if two machines don’t have the same absolute source root paths, XCRemoteCache carries an extra fingerprint file (called a fingerprint override) next to the \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule \u003c/code\u003ethat includes a fingerprint of all the files used in the compilation step. A fingerprint override is path agnostic, so contrary to the \u003ccode\u003e.swiftmodule\u003c/code\u003e file, it can be used as a byte-level stable fingerprint of a Swift target. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDebug symbols, other path-sensitive files, are appended to the binary package to associate the machine code with the corresponding source location when debugging. The XCRemoteCache leverages support for LLDB runtime path rewrites using \u003ccode\u003esettings set target.source-map\u003c/code\u003e. Both producer and consumer pass \u003ccode\u003edebug-prefix-map\u003c/code\u003e parameters to the Swift and Clang compilers to align the source root of all debug symbols making the LLDB source mapping a simple, single-line command.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Spotify story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify, we have fast, well-optimized CI jobs that no longer slow down our development feedback loop (please head to \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/05/01/how-we-gave-superpowers-to-our-macos-ci/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eHow We Gave Superpowers to Our macOS CI\u003c/a\u003e to read more about that), so we focused on applying XCRemoteCache on local machines. Keep in mind that the tool is able to work on CI machines and accelerate PR jobs, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn controlled conditions, XCRemoteCache was able to cut the very first iOS Spotify application build time by 85%. This was a great achievement, but in practice, developers introduce changes locally, and some targets have to be compiled locally. Our goal was to evaluate real-world scenarios to understand their true impact. To estimate that, we rolled out the remote cache to 50% of our developers for a week and compared all build metrics. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eResults exceeded our expectations — we observed a huge improvement of the local build times: \u003cstrong\u003emedian clean build and incremental build times decreased by 70% and 6%, respectively. \u003c/strong\u003eWe classify builds as \u003cem\u003eclean\u003c/em\u003e when at least 50% of all targets compile at least one file.  Other builds that compile at least one file are \u003cem\u003eincremental\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, we enabled XCRemoteCache into our main application more than a year ago, and since then, it has worked flawlessly. We get very positive feedback from our developers and, as a side effect, we’ve seen the portion of clean builds almost double compared to the pre-remote cache times. Developers nowadays are twice more likely to rebase their working branches, eventually leading to fewer conflicts when creating a pull request. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to integrate XCRemoteCache into your existing project\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that XCRemoteCache is open source, you can apply it to your own project with minimum effort. It supports multiple project setups, including the ones managed by CocoaPods, Carthage, or any other custom dependency management. Keep in mind, though, that for best results, your project should be split into several targets or you risk frequent cache invalidations, as described above.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor seamless integration, we are open sourcing a \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spotify/XCRemoteCache/tree/master/cocoapods-plugin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eCocoaPods plugin\u003c/a\u003e and provide an automated script to modify the existing .xcodeproj project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eXCRemoteCache works with any HTTP server that supports PUT, HEAD, and GET requests.

There are numerous challenges in managing the data that goes into a model, running and tracking experiments, and monitoring and retraining models.

This model is then deployed to production systems and can start making predictions for listeners. Similar to most production systems, models (and the services/pipelines that serve them) should be monitored closely. To keep a model up to date (which is more important for some tasks than others; more to come on this), retraining and model versioning are the last steps in our workflow. This part of our stack and workflow has had significant changes since our first model — making batch predictions (offline) of content listeners are likely to stream — to now, where all our models are served in real time.

There are numerous challenges in managing the data that goes into a model, running and tracking experiments, and monitoring and retraining models. While we have always tried to keep our ML infrastructure simple, and as close to the sources of features as possible, it has become drastically easier for our squads to deploy and maintain models now than when we started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt a high level, an ML workflow can be broken down into three main phases: 1) data management, 2) experimentation, and 3) operationalization.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-700x146.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"784\" height=\"164\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-700x146.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-250x52.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-768x160.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-120x25.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow.png 1351w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s common to iteratively work on the training and evaluation phase until a final model version is selected as the best. This model is then deployed to production systems and can start making predictions for listeners. Similar to most production systems, models (and the services/pipelines that serve them) should be monitored closely. To keep a model up to date (which is more important for some tasks than others; more to come on this), retraining and model versioning are the last steps in our workflow. This part of our stack and workflow has had significant changes since our first model — making batch predictions (offline) of content listeners are likely to stream — to now, where all our models are served in real time.

There are numerous challenges in managing the data that goes into a model, running and tracking experiments, and monitoring and retraining models. While we have always tried to keep our ML infrastructure simple, and as close to the sources of features as possible, it has become drastically easier for our squads to deploy and maintain models now than when we started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt a high level, an ML workflow can be broken down into three main phases: 1) data management, 2) experimentation, and 3) operationalization.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-700x146.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"784\" height=\"164\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-700x146.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-250x52.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-768x160.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-120x25.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow.png 1351w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s common to iteratively work on the training and evaluation phase until a final model version is selected as the best. This model is then deployed to production systems and can start making predictions for listeners. Similar to most production systems, models (and the services/pipelines that serve them) should be monitored closely. To keep a model up to date (which is more important for some tasks than others; more to come on this), retraining and model versioning are the last steps in our workflow. This part of our stack and workflow has had significant changes since our first model — making batch predictions (offline) of content listeners are likely to stream — to now, where all our models are served in real time. The figure below shows where our machine learning stack started and where we are now:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"533\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/How-it-started_how-its-going-700x533.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/How-it-started_how-its-going-700x533.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/How-it-started_how-its-going-250x190.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/How-it-started_how-its-going-768x584.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/How-it-started_how-its-going-120x91.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/How-it-started_how-its-going.png 1012w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur current ML stack automates a lot of the processes involved in maintaining models in production (with online serving): we have automated feature logging instrumented in our serving infrastructure, with both scheduled Scio pipelines to transform these features and Kubeflow pipelines to retrain weekly. We have also implemented data validation of our training and serving features (as well as validation between subsequent training datasets) to verify our features are consistent and follow the same distributions at training and inference times. In our Kubeflow pipelines, we have components that check the evaluation score and automatically push the model to production if the score is above our threshold. With this stack, we monitor and alert on the automatic data validation pipeline, as well as the online deployments of our models — allowing us to handle any issues as soon as they arise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith a lot of effort and many lessons learned, our ML stack has evolved to make these processes automated and more reliable, enabling us to iterate faster to improve our models and increase our engineering productivity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow we unified training and serving data\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we first start to think about a problem, we always dig into the data first — what data would be useful? What data is available? And then we take a really close look at the data that will be used for features, characterizing what is in the dataset and identifying the edge cases in the data. We feel fairly confident about the contents of the data used for our training features as well as what the transformed data looks like, but features fetched and transformed at \u003cem\u003eserving\u003c/em\u003e time are an entirely different story. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBatch training data and batch predictions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, we have had one set of infrastructure for fetching and transforming features during experimentation (training) and a different set of infrastructure for fetching and transforming features for making predictions (serving). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eThen we started to make online predictions (… with the wrong data)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we changed the Podcast Model from making batch offline predictions to serving in real time, we set up a new service that could support this — this new service had to fetch and transform features, make the prediction, and respond to the request. The important part here is that the feature processing and transformation was now in a different place than where the corresponding training feature processing took place. And, unfortunately, models are like black boxes, so testing the output is difficult, if not impossible. A while ago, we discovered that we had been transforming one of the model’s features slightly differently at training time than at serving time, leading to potentially degraded recommendations — and there was no way to detect this, so it continued to happen for four months.Think about this for just a second. Such a simple part of our stack — at most, a few lines of code — was doing the wrong thing and impacted the recommendations produced by our model. Our short-term fix was to simply change the one line of code in our prediction service that was causing the issue, but we knew long term that we needed to either have a single source of data for both training and serving, or we needed to ensure that data was produced and transformed the same way in both stages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eOne transformation implementation to rule them all\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur first approach was to make any feature processing and transformation occur in the same code path, so that training and serving features would be processed identically. Taking the Shortcuts Model as an example again, our goal was to get rid of the Python service that transformed training features — this service was always running and constantly checking, on all days, to see if it was a Monday; if so, then it would request data from the necessary service (at a rate-limited 5 requests/second) and transform them into features; ideally, this would have been implemented as a pipeline, but we couldn’t schedule and orchestrate it because the process took more than 24 hours. There were many reasons we wanted to migrate away from this approach, but logging features when the only data source for features is a different service (owned by a different squad) proved difficult. Using our serving infrastructure’s feature logging capabilities, we could automatically log already transformed features, which could later be used for training. At this point, all of our features for training and serving were being transformed by code in the Java service. And we now use this feature logging for all of our models both to solve this problem, and also because it reduces the amount of additional infrastructure we need to support.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBut wait, we can do more by validating our data\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second approach we took to ensure our training and serving features did not differ was to use Tensorflow Data Validation (TFDV) to compare training and serving data schemas and feature distributions on a daily basis. The alerting we have added to our data validation pipeline allows us to detect significant differences in our feature sets — it uses the Chebyshev distance metric, which compares the distance between two vectors, and can help alert us to drift in training and serving features.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we knew that understanding what is in our data is crucial, we quickly learned that it’s easy to make mistakes when moving models to production because the data often uses a different processing library. We didn’t expect many data differences, but validating and alerting on issues lets us know if something changed, and how we should remediate the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStay tuned for Part II as we take a closer look at how we evaluate our models using offline and online metrics, why it’s so important to actually look at the recommendations we are making, and the challenges we faced in our journey to CI/CD in model retraining. \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n\n        Tags: \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/machine-learning/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003emachine learning\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e        \n            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

There are numerous challenges in managing the data that goes into a model, running and tracking experiments, and monitoring and retraining models. While we have always tried to keep our ML infrastructure simple, and as close to the sources of features as possible, it has become drastically easier for our squads to deploy and maintain models now than when we started.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt a high level, an ML workflow can be broken down into three main phases: 1) data management, 2) experimentation, and 3) operationalization.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-700x146.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"784\" height=\"164\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-700x146.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-250x52.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-768x160.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow-120x25.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/11/Workflow.png 1351w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 784px) 100vw, 784px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s common to iteratively work on the training and evaluation phase until a final model version is selected as the best. This model is then deployed to production systems and can start making predictions for listeners. Similar to most production systems, models (and the services/pipelines that serve them) should be monitored closely. To keep a model up to date (which is more important for some tasks than others; more to come on this), retraining and model versioning are the last steps in our workflow. This part of our stack and workflow has had significant changes since our first model — making batch predictions (offline) of content listeners are likely to stream — to now, where all our models are served in real time.

We have also implemented data validation of our training and serving features (as well as validation between subsequent training datasets) to verify our features are consistent and follow the same distributions at training and inference times. In our Kubeflow pipelines, we have components that check the evaluation score and automatically push the model to production if the score is above our threshold. With this stack, we monitor and alert on the automatic data validation pipeline, as well as the online deployments of our models — allowing us to handle any issues as soon as they arise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith a lot of effort and many lessons learned, our ML stack has evolved to make these processes automated and more reliable, enabling us to iterate faster to improve our models and increase our engineering productivity. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow we unified training and serving data\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we first start to think about a problem, we always dig into the data first — what data would be useful? What data is available? And then we take a really close look at the data that will be used for features, characterizing what is in the dataset and identifying the edge cases in the data. We feel fairly confident about the contents of the data used for our training features as well as what the transformed data looks like, but features fetched and transformed at \u003cem\u003eserving\u003c/em\u003e time are an entirely different story. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBatch training data and batch predictions\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHistorically, we have had one set of infrastructure for fetching and transforming features during experimentation (training) and a different set of infrastructure for fetching and transforming features for making predictions (serving). \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eThen we started to make online predictions (… with the wrong data)\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we changed the Podcast Model from making batch offline predictions to serving in real time, we set up a new service that could support this — this new service had to fetch and transform features, make the prediction, and respond to the request. The important part here is that the feature processing and transformation was now in a different place than where the corresponding training feature processing took place. And, unfortunately, models are like black boxes, so testing the output is difficult, if not impossible. A while ago, we discovered that we had been transforming one of the model’s features slightly differently at training time than at serving time, leading to potentially degraded recommendations — and there was no way to detect this, so it continued to happen for four months.Think about this for just a second. Such a simple part of our stack — at most, a few lines of code — was doing the wrong thing and impacted the recommendations produced by our model. Our short-term fix was to simply change the one line of code in our prediction service that was causing the issue, but we knew long term that we needed to either have a single source of data for both training and serving, or we needed to ensure that data was produced and transformed the same way in both stages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eOne transformation implementation to rule them all\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur first approach was to make any feature processing and transformation occur in the same code path, so that training and serving features would be processed identically. Taking the Shortcuts Model as an example again, our goal was to get rid of the Python service that transformed training features — this service was always running and constantly checking, on all days, to see if it was a Monday; if so, then it would request data from the necessary service (at a rate-limited 5 requests/second) and transform them into features; ideally, this would have been implemented as a pipeline, but we couldn’t schedule and orchestrate it because the process took more than 24 hours. There were many reasons we wanted to migrate away from this approach, but logging features when the only data source for features is a different service (owned by a different squad) proved difficult. Using our serving infrastructure’s feature logging capabilities, we could automatically log already transformed features, which could later be used for training. At this point, all of our features for training and serving were being transformed by code in the Java service. And we now use this feature logging for all of our models both to solve this problem, and also because it reduces the amount of additional infrastructure we need to support.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBut wait, we can do more by validating our data\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe second approach we took to ensure our training and serving features did not differ was to use Tensorflow Data Validation (TFDV) to compare training and serving data schemas and feature distributions on a daily basis. The alerting we have added to our data validation pipeline allows us to detect significant differences in our feature sets — it uses the Chebyshev distance metric, which compares the distance between two vectors, and can help alert us to drift in training and serving features.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we knew that understanding what is in our data is crucial, we quickly learned that it’s easy to make mistakes when moving models to production because the data often uses a different processing library. We didn’t expect many data differences, but validating and alerting on issues lets us know if something changed, and how we should remediate the issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStay tuned for Part II as we take a closer look at how we evaluate our models using offline and online metrics, why it’s so important to actually look at the recommendations we are making, and the challenges we faced in our journey to CI/CD in model retraining. \u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n\n        Tags: \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/machine-learning/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003emachine learning\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n        \n\n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

We log a variety of data, from listening history, to results of A/B testing, to page load times so we can analyze and improve the Spotify service. We instrument and log data across every surface that is running Spotify code through a system called the Event Delivery Infrastructure (EDI). Throughout this blog post we make a distinction between the internal users of the EDI, who are Spotify Engineers, Data Scientists, PMs and squads, and end users, who use Spotify as a service and audio platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, we redesigned the EDI in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) when Spotify migrated to the cloud, and we documented the journey in three blog posts (\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/02/25/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-i/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart I\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/03/03/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-ii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart II\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/03/10/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-iii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart III\u003c/a\u003e).

Our design was optimized to make it quick and easy for internal developers to instrument and log the data they needed. We then extended it to adapt to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we introduced streaming event delivery in addition to batch, and we brought BigQuery to our data community. We also improved operational stability and the quality of life of our on-call engineers. The peak traffic increased from 1.5M events per second to nearly 8M, and we were ready for that massive scale increase. This increased the total volume of data which we ingested daily to nearly 70TB! (Figure 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-700x436.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-700x436.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-250x156.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-768x478.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-120x75.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1.png 1480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 1: Average total volume (TB) of events stored daily by our \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eETL process\u003c/a\u003e (after compression).\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, with that high adoption and traffic increase we discovered some bottlenecks. Our internal users had feature requests and needed more from the system. Now our incomplete and low-quality data was degrading the productivity of the Spotify data community. Whoops!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat was hurting us?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we designed and built the initial EDI, our team had the mission statement to “provide infrastructure for teams at Spotify to reliably collect data, and make it available, safely and efficiently.” The use cases we focused on were well supported, such as music streaming and application monitoring. As other use cases started to appear, the assumptions we made when building the system had to be revisited. During three years of operating and scaling the existing EDI, we gathered a lot of feedback from our internal users and learned a lot about our limitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eData loss\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost events generated on mobile clients were sent in a fire-and-forget fashion. This might seem surprising, but because end users can enjoy Spotify while offline, there are some complications around deduplication of data that is re-sent. For example, if we detect that we are missing a data point, we don’t necessarily know if it is actually lost, or just has not arrived yet due to the user being offline, in a tunnel, or maybe having a flaky network connection. This leads to a small percentage of data loss for nearly all the data we collect, which is not acceptable for some types of data. Furthermore, this problem is compounded for datasets generated from a combination of multiple event types in order to “connect the dots” in user journeys where, for example, a single lost event can compromise the whole journey. While we had some specific client code and algorithms to reliably deliver business-critical data exactly once, it was not done in a way that we could extend to all 600+ event types that we had at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eControl plane UX\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe workflow for a customer to progress from “instrumentation to insights” took far too long. Under normal circumstances it would take a customer a week to go through this workflow and get their data. One issue was that multiple components in the EDI had to be schema aware. For example, the receiver service, which is the entry point of the infrastructure, uses the schemas to validate that incoming data is well formed. Due to some tech debt, it took a few hours to propagate the schemas for this validation. This was an eternity in terms of iteration time. Since this process was so painful, some teams tried to instrument their features or services, but then gave up. Some other teams would shoehorn their data into existing data events. This led to gaps in what was instrumented, and a data-quality nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBackwards compatible? Or stuck in the past?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor strategic reasons, it was critical, in 2016, that we build the EDI in GCP and migrate over as quickly as possible. A key decision we took to make this happen was to stay backwards compatible to minimize the migration time. That meant we had to stick with some historical design choices that we would not have if we had built this EDI from scratch. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTab-separated values (TSV):\u003c/strong\u003e All data events were sent as TSV strings. The schemas were parsed and converted to Avro with a Python library created in 2007. The schema-aware tooling for parsing the TSV data was the main cause for the painful control plane UX mentioned earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStateful services:\u003c/strong\u003e Data events were first stored on disk and then forwarded to the EDI. This made us resilient to crashes, but made us vulnerable to data loss if a machine was taken down. Furthermore, Spotify could not take advantage of auto-scaling mechanisms or Kubernetes (without difficult workarounds) because the EDI made our service ecosystem stateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLegacy perimeter:\u003c/strong\u003e Since data events were forwarded from disk to our EDI, all events triggered by Spotify clients needed to be emitted from our perimeter servers. These servers had to keep events on disk and were tightly coupled to our legacy logging mechanism. This caused some pain to perimeter administrators and hindered architectural innovations. Besides the additional complexity in the perimeter, the shared ownership of different teams with different goals caused alignment problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe situation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe had hundreds of services sending events through a legacy EDI by logging data to disk. After being ingested by the infrastructure, events were consumed by hundreds of downstream data pipelines to produce derivative datasets (Figure 2). Our goal was to build a platform that takes advantage of the modern landscape in the cloud while also enabling legacy event types to be migrated easily. The workflow to create new events should be frictionless, while still following our data governance principles and applicable privacy laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"591\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2.png 591w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2-250x128.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2-120x61.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 2.

A new version of our mobile apps takes several months to gain adoption from a high percentage of Spotify end users. We knew that we would have traffic coming to both the old and new EDIs for quite some time. Moreover, events emitted from embedded devices, such as TVs and speakers, would need special treatment as some of these devices are unlikely to ever be upgraded. We call this challenge “The Long Tail Problem”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe strategy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe partially solved “The Long Tail Problem” by designing a data transformation pipeline that reads events from legacy clients, converts them, and feeds them from the legacy EDI into the new infrastructure (Figure 3). Since we were breaking backwards compatibility, we took the opportunity to update our data model. The transformation to the new data model would not have all the necessary information available, so missing or inaccurate fields were expected occasionally. But since this transformation only applied to legacy clients, it would decrease as end users upgraded to the latest version of Spotify. This traffic would become negligible, eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-700x355.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-700x355.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-250x127.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-768x390.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-120x61.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3.png 1286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 3: To handle clients which had not yet upgraded to the latest version, we implemented a job to export legacy data to the new EDI and transform it to our new data model.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe gave data producers two options to adopt the new EDI: either redesign their instrumentation using the new data model, or stick with what they have and turn on exporting data from the legacy EDI to the new EDI. After producers onboarded, event consumers would migrate to read data from the new EDI. If producers and consumers agree to use the exporter, they would first need to update any downstream pipelines to read from the new infrastructure before making client-side changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGet in production with real use cases ASAP\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to validate our decisions, we had to find early adopters to start producing events with the new infrastructure. We presented the advantages and explained the limitations of our alpha product to potential interested teams. It was important to be able to experiment, break, and fix issues fast and safely without worrying about affecting critical production systems or data. Setting expectations with our internal users was important so we could make breaking changes when our assumptions were wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext, we found at least one real use case to migrate. We were looking for something specific, since different event types have different levels of importance, timeliness requirements, and downstream dependencies. We reached out to event owners to understand how their data was being used and how we could help them migrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGiven a set of eligible event types, we identified use cases that were satisfied by the limited features we had built so far. Learning which features our internal users were missing also helped prioritize our roadmap. The more features we added to the new EDI, the more event types we could onboard. We periodically revisited our design decisions and assumptions in order to identify potential problems in the new infrastructure as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we had a prototype that was working with real production traffic, we solidified the interfaces and data model and helped the alpha internal users adapt to the changes (Figure 4). This enabled us to decouple the significant work of migrating the 600+ event types which were running on the legacy infrastructure, and actually building the new EDI behind the abstractions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-700x187.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-700x187.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-250x67.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-768x206.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-1536x411.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-120x32.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 4: New interfaces for the prototype infrastructure, so we could concurrently migrate internal users to the new Event Delivery Infrastructure while building it.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eJust-in-time optimizations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrematurely optimizing is generally a bad idea without motivating metrics. We always want to be as efficient as possible, but we had to prioritize and make trade-offs. Part of the challenge was to find a good balance between the desired efficiency of our infrastructure and the features we absolutely needed to release in order to accomplish our goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe learned from the first EDI that we needed to design for our targeted service availability from the start. Since transactional data collection was not required, there was no need for 100% delivery. We instead had to determine what level of service availability was acceptable and understand the trade-offs associated with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe design changes and decisions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have two main interfaces to the EDI. The control plane is the starting point where internal users declare their events, design their schemas, and bind them to specific SDKs. The data plane receives events sent by those SDKs, divides them by event type, and makes them available as batch datasets or data-streaming topics. The events go through several other components that deduplicate, translate to our well-designed data model, and pseudonymize personal information. The output data is reliably stored for Spotify’s data community to consume and build data pipelines. Due to the evolving needs of internal users, as well as operational overhead and scalability concerns, we needed to make changes between the old and new infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eClient re-sends and new deduplication\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to reduce event loss and improve reliability, we implemented client resends. Due to connection stability and offline mode, these resends may happen immediately, within a few minutes, or maybe several days later. They may never happen! It’s actually impossible to tell if an event has been lost in transport, or if a user has used Spotify and then dropped their phone in the ocean, causing data loss. The combination of resend strategies and flaky network connections complicates things and introduces duplicate events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the old infrastructure, we only deduplicate events within a small window of hours. However, due to the significant increase of duplicates, we hit some bottlenecks and decided to redesign the job. The biggest changes in the new job are the introduction of event message identifiers, and the adoption of Google’s Dataflow processing service instead of Hadoop. The event message identifiers were used to generate lookup indices and remove duplicates. This new strategy allowed us to look back across multiple weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eReceiver service — offline to online\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe legacy EDI used files on disk to store events before they were sent to a receiver service.  Spotify’s access point or other backend services would have their own availability guarantees, and we would read the data from disk eventually. In the new EDI, our receiver service needs its own availability guarantees, which was a paradigm shift in our infrastructure and for our team as \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSREs\u003c/a\u003e. Furthermore, those files on disk were a blocker for Spotify to leverage auto-scaling fleets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the new EDI, we have the receiver service as a highly available API used by SDKs to send events. In case of a receiver service outage, events would be temporarily stored on clients and, eventually, re-sent according to a predefined retry policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eManaged Dataflow\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe wanted the new EDI to leverage cloud-managed services as much as possible. By rebuilding the architecture to run in the cloud, we can offload management responsibilities to Google, and our team can focus on providing additional value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen building the legacy EDI, we needed to migrate a heavy Hadoop job from our on-premise cluster to the cloud. The easiest way was to run the same job on Google’s managed Hadoop solution, Dataproc, so that’s what we did. In the new EDI, the new implementation of that job uses \u003ca href=\"https://spotify.github.io/scio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eScio\u003c/a\u003e (Scala API for Apache Beam) and runs on Google’s Dataflow instead. We considered Spark or Flink, but those had to run over Hadoop, which goes against our strategy to save us operational burden and cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy using Dataflow, we no longer needed to keep long-lived Hadoop clusters to execute our jobs. These clusters had to be big enough to process the largest job without issues, and were overkill for almost everything else. Maintaining these clusters was incredibly expensive. Conversely, Dataflow recycles clusters for every job and supports auto-scaling, allowing us to use and pay only for the resources we need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWrap-up\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we decided to redesign our EDI, we evaluated new technologies and adopted new paradigms available to us in the cloud. We had been operating our old infrastructure for years, and that helped us to understand the main pain points and fragilities. We made decisions based on the technical direction of the company, the industry state of the art, and the known scalability issues with existing components. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe started by first designing new components for the new EDI, which we hacked together into a proof of concept and quickly evolved to a more robust prototype that could be used in production. Shipping as soon as possible was critical to validate the infrastructure end to end and catch issues fast. Having the internal users onboarded early was an important forcing function to keep quality and operational maturity high. Next, we solidified the interfaces to the prototype infrastructure and scaled up traffic by onboarding many noncritical event types. With the interfaces stable, we could improve or change out the internals without friction. This approach decoupled the mass migration from actually rebuilding the infrastructure and reduced wall-clock project time significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we neared the end of the migration, we had thrown out nearly all the old, obsolete infrastructure in favor of the state of the art. We successfully changed the wheels of the moving bus, and gave Spotify’s data community a smooth ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cbr/\u003e\n\n        \n        \n\n        \n\n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

Throughout this blog post we make a distinction between the internal users of the EDI, who are Spotify Engineers, Data Scientists, PMs and squads, and end users, who use Spotify as a service and audio platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, we redesigned the EDI in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) when Spotify migrated to the cloud, and we documented the journey in three blog posts (\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/02/25/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-i/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart I\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/03/03/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-ii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart II\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/03/10/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-iii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart III\u003c/a\u003e). Not everything went as planned, and we wrote about our learnings from operating our cloud-native EDI in \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/11/12/spotifys-event-delivery-life-in-the-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart IV\u003c/a\u003e. Our design was optimized to make it quick and easy for internal developers to instrument and log the data they needed. We then extended it to adapt to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we introduced streaming event delivery in addition to batch, and we brought BigQuery to our data community. We also improved operational stability and the quality of life of our on-call engineers. The peak traffic increased from 1.5M events per second to nearly 8M, and we were ready for that massive scale increase. This increased the total volume of data which we ingested daily to nearly 70TB! (Figure 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-700x436.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-700x436.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-250x156.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-768x478.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-120x75.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1.png 1480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 1: Average total volume (TB) of events stored daily by our \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eETL process\u003c/a\u003e (after compression).\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, with that high adoption and traffic increase we discovered some bottlenecks. Our internal users had feature requests and needed more from the system. Now our incomplete and low-quality data was degrading the productivity of the Spotify data community. Whoops!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat was hurting us?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we designed and built the initial EDI, our team had the mission statement to “provide infrastructure for teams at Spotify to reliably collect data, and make it available, safely and efficiently.” The use cases we focused on were well supported, such as music streaming and application monitoring. As other use cases started to appear, the assumptions we made when building the system had to be revisited. During three years of operating and scaling the existing EDI, we gathered a lot of feedback from our internal users and learned a lot about our limitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eData loss\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost events generated on mobile clients were sent in a fire-and-forget fashion. This might seem surprising, but because end users can enjoy Spotify while offline, there are some complications around deduplication of data that is re-sent. For example, if we detect that we are missing a data point, we don’t necessarily know if it is actually lost, or just has not arrived yet due to the user being offline, in a tunnel, or maybe having a flaky network connection. This leads to a small percentage of data loss for nearly all the data we collect, which is not acceptable for some types of data. Furthermore, this problem is compounded for datasets generated from a combination of multiple event types in order to “connect the dots” in user journeys where, for example, a single lost event can compromise the whole journey. While we had some specific client code and algorithms to reliably deliver business-critical data exactly once, it was not done in a way that we could extend to all 600+ event types that we had at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eControl plane UX\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe workflow for a customer to progress from “instrumentation to insights” took far too long. Under normal circumstances it would take a customer a week to go through this workflow and get their data. One issue was that multiple components in the EDI had to be schema aware. For example, the receiver service, which is the entry point of the infrastructure, uses the schemas to validate that incoming data is well formed. Due to some tech debt, it took a few hours to propagate the schemas for this validation. This was an eternity in terms of iteration time. Since this process was so painful, some teams tried to instrument their features or services, but then gave up. Some other teams would shoehorn their data into existing data events. This led to gaps in what was instrumented, and a data-quality nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBackwards compatible? Or stuck in the past?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor strategic reasons, it was critical, in 2016, that we build the EDI in GCP and migrate over as quickly as possible. A key decision we took to make this happen was to stay backwards compatible to minimize the migration time. That meant we had to stick with some historical design choices that we would not have if we had built this EDI from scratch. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTab-separated values (TSV):\u003c/strong\u003e All data events were sent as TSV strings. The schemas were parsed and converted to Avro with a Python library created in 2007. The schema-aware tooling for parsing the TSV data was the main cause for the painful control plane UX mentioned earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStateful services:\u003c/strong\u003e Data events were first stored on disk and then forwarded to the EDI. This made us resilient to crashes, but made us vulnerable to data loss if a machine was taken down. Furthermore, Spotify could not take advantage of auto-scaling mechanisms or Kubernetes (without difficult workarounds) because the EDI made our service ecosystem stateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLegacy perimeter:\u003c/strong\u003e Since data events were forwarded from disk to our EDI, all events triggered by Spotify clients needed to be emitted from our perimeter servers. These servers had to keep events on disk and were tightly coupled to our legacy logging mechanism. This caused some pain to perimeter administrators and hindered architectural innovations. Besides the additional complexity in the perimeter, the shared ownership of different teams with different goals caused alignment problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe situation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe had hundreds of services sending events through a legacy EDI by logging data to disk. After being ingested by the infrastructure, events were consumed by hundreds of downstream data pipelines to produce derivative datasets (Figure 2). Our goal was to build a platform that takes advantage of the modern landscape in the cloud while also enabling legacy event types to be migrated easily. The workflow to create new events should be frictionless, while still following our data governance principles and applicable privacy laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"591\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2.png 591w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2-250x128.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2-120x61.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 2: Events produced by our internal services go through the legacy EDI and are consumed by hundreds of data pipelines.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTransitioning event logging to a new infrastructure would need to take into consideration the long tail that mobile app updates have. A new version of our mobile apps takes several months to gain adoption from a high percentage of Spotify end users. We knew that we would have traffic coming to both the old and new EDIs for quite some time. Moreover, events emitted from embedded devices, such as TVs and speakers, would need special treatment as some of these devices are unlikely to ever be upgraded. We call this challenge “The Long Tail Problem”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe strategy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe partially solved “The Long Tail Problem” by designing a data transformation pipeline that reads events from legacy clients, converts them, and feeds them from the legacy EDI into the new infrastructure (Figure 3). Since we were breaking backwards compatibility, we took the opportunity to update our data model. The transformation to the new data model would not have all the necessary information available, so missing or inaccurate fields were expected occasionally. But since this transformation only applied to legacy clients, it would decrease as end users upgraded to the latest version of Spotify. This traffic would become negligible, eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-700x355.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-700x355.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-250x127.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-768x390.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-120x61.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3.png 1286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 3: To handle clients which had not yet upgraded to the latest version, we implemented a job to export legacy data to the new EDI and transform it to our new data model.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe gave data producers two options to adopt the new EDI: either redesign their instrumentation using the new data model, or stick with what they have and turn on exporting data from the legacy EDI to the new EDI. After producers onboarded, event consumers would migrate to read data from the new EDI. If producers and consumers agree to use the exporter, they would first need to update any downstream pipelines to read from the new infrastructure before making client-side changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGet in production with real use cases ASAP\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to validate our decisions, we had to find early adopters to start producing events with the new infrastructure. We presented the advantages and explained the limitations of our alpha product to potential interested teams. It was important to be able to experiment, break, and fix issues fast and safely without worrying about affecting critical production systems or data. Setting expectations with our internal users was important so we could make breaking changes when our assumptions were wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext, we found at least one real use case to migrate. We were looking for something specific, since different event types have different levels of importance, timeliness requirements, and downstream dependencies. We reached out to event owners to understand how their data was being used and how we could help them migrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGiven a set of eligible event types, we identified use cases that were satisfied by the limited features we had built so far. Learning which features our internal users were missing also helped prioritize our roadmap. The more features we added to the new EDI, the more event types we could onboard. We periodically revisited our design decisions and assumptions in order to identify potential problems in the new infrastructure as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we had a prototype that was working with real production traffic, we solidified the interfaces and data model and helped the alpha internal users adapt to the changes (Figure 4). This enabled us to decouple the significant work of migrating the 600+ event types which were running on the legacy infrastructure, and actually building the new EDI behind the abstractions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-700x187.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-700x187.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-250x67.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-768x206.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-1536x411.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-120x32.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 4: New interfaces for the prototype infrastructure, so we could concurrently migrate internal users to the new Event Delivery Infrastructure while building it.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eJust-in-time optimizations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrematurely optimizing is generally a bad idea without motivating metrics. We always want to be as efficient as possible, but we had to prioritize and make trade-offs. Part of the challenge was to find a good balance between the desired efficiency of our infrastructure and the features we absolutely needed to release in order to accomplish our goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe learned from the first EDI that we needed to design for our targeted service availability from the start. Since transactional data collection was not required, there was no need for 100% delivery. We instead had to determine what level of service availability was acceptable and understand the trade-offs associated with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe design changes and decisions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have two main interfaces to the EDI. The control plane is the starting point where internal users declare their events, design their schemas, and bind them to specific SDKs. The data plane receives events sent by those SDKs, divides them by event type, and makes them available as batch datasets or data-streaming topics. The events go through several other components that deduplicate, translate to our well-designed data model, and pseudonymize personal information. The output data is reliably stored for Spotify’s data community to consume and build data pipelines. Due to the evolving needs of internal users, as well as operational overhead and scalability concerns, we needed to make changes between the old and new infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eClient re-sends and new deduplication\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to reduce event loss and improve reliability, we implemented client resends. Due to connection stability and offline mode, these resends may happen immediately, within a few minutes, or maybe several days later. They may never happen! It’s actually impossible to tell if an event has been lost in transport, or if a user has used Spotify and then dropped their phone in the ocean, causing data loss. The combination of resend strategies and flaky network connections complicates things and introduces duplicate events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the old infrastructure, we only deduplicate events within a small window of hours. However, due to the significant increase of duplicates, we hit some bottlenecks and decided to redesign the job. The biggest changes in the new job are the introduction of event message identifiers, and the adoption of Google’s Dataflow processing service instead of Hadoop. The event message identifiers were used to generate lookup indices and remove duplicates. This new strategy allowed us to look back across multiple weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eReceiver service — offline to online\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe legacy EDI used files on disk to store events before they were sent to a receiver service.  Spotify’s access point or other backend services would have their own availability guarantees, and we would read the data from disk eventually. In the new EDI, our receiver service needs its own availability guarantees, which was a paradigm shift in our infrastructure and for our team as \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSREs\u003c/a\u003e. Furthermore, those files on disk were a blocker for Spotify to leverage auto-scaling fleets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the new EDI, we have the receiver service as a highly available API used by SDKs to send events. In case of a receiver service outage, events would be temporarily stored on clients and, eventually, re-sent according to a predefined retry policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eManaged Dataflow\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe wanted the new EDI to leverage cloud-managed services as much as possible. By rebuilding the architecture to run in the cloud, we can offload management responsibilities to Google, and our team can focus on providing additional value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen building the legacy EDI, we needed to migrate a heavy Hadoop job from our on-premise cluster to the cloud. The easiest way was to run the same job on Google’s managed Hadoop solution, Dataproc, so that’s what we did. In the new EDI, the new implementation of that job uses \u003ca href=\"https://spotify.github.io/scio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eScio\u003c/a\u003e (Scala API for Apache Beam) and runs on Google’s Dataflow instead. We considered Spark or Flink, but those had to run over Hadoop, which goes against our strategy to save us operational burden and cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy using Dataflow, we no longer needed to keep long-lived Hadoop clusters to execute our jobs. These clusters had to be big enough to process the largest job without issues, and were overkill for almost everything else. Maintaining these clusters was incredibly expensive. Conversely, Dataflow recycles clusters for every job and supports auto-scaling, allowing us to use and pay only for the resources we need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWrap-up\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we decided to redesign our EDI, we evaluated new technologies and adopted new paradigms available to us in the cloud. We had been operating our old infrastructure for years, and that helped us to understand the main pain points and fragilities. We made decisions based on the technical direction of the company, the industry state of the art, and the known scalability issues with existing components. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe started by first designing new components for the new EDI, which we hacked together into a proof of concept and quickly evolved to a more robust prototype that could be used in production. Shipping as soon as possible was critical to validate the infrastructure end to end and catch issues fast. Having the internal users onboarded early was an important forcing function to keep quality and operational maturity high. Next, we solidified the interfaces to the prototype infrastructure and scaled up traffic by onboarding many noncritical event types. With the interfaces stable, we could improve or change out the internals without friction. This approach decoupled the mass migration from actually rebuilding the infrastructure and reduced wall-clock project time significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we neared the end of the migration, we had thrown out nearly all the old, obsolete infrastructure in favor of the state of the art. We successfully changed the wheels of the moving bus, and gave Spotify’s data community a smooth ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n\n        Tags: \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/data/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003eData\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e        \n            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

We log a variety of data, from listening history, to results of A/B testing, to page load times so we can analyze and improve the Spotify service. We instrument and log data across every surface that is running Spotify code through a system called the Event Delivery Infrastructure (EDI). Throughout this blog post we make a distinction between the internal users of the EDI, who are Spotify Engineers, Data Scientists, PMs and squads, and end users, who use Spotify as a service and audio platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, we redesigned the EDI in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) when Spotify migrated to the cloud, and we documented the journey in three blog posts (\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/02/25/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-i/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart I\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/03/03/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-ii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart II\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/03/10/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-iii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart III\u003c/a\u003e). Not everything went as planned, and we wrote about our learnings from operating our cloud-native EDI in \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/11/12/spotifys-event-delivery-life-in-the-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart IV\u003c/a\u003e. Our design was optimized to make it quick and easy for internal developers to instrument and log the data they needed. We then extended it to adapt to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we introduced streaming event delivery in addition to batch, and we brought BigQuery to our data community. We also improved operational stability and the quality of life of our on-call engineers. The peak traffic increased from 1.5M events per second to nearly 8M, and we were ready for that massive scale increase. This increased the total volume of data which we ingested daily to nearly 70TB! (Figure 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-700x436.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-700x436.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-250x156.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-768x478.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-120x75.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1.png 1480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 1: Average total volume (TB) of events stored daily by our \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eETL process\u003c/a\u003e (after compression).\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, with that high adoption and traffic increase we discovered some bottlenecks. Our internal users had feature requests and needed more from the system. Now our incomplete and low-quality data was degrading the productivity of the Spotify data community. Whoops!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat was hurting us?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we designed and built the initial EDI, our team had the mission statement to “provide infrastructure for teams at Spotify to reliably collect data, and make it available, safely and efficiently.” The use cases we focused on were well supported, such as music streaming and application monitoring. As other use cases started to appear, the assumptions we made when building the system had to be revisited. During three years of operating and scaling the existing EDI, we gathered a lot of feedback from our internal users and learned a lot about our limitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eData loss\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost events generated on mobile clients were sent in a fire-and-forget fashion. This might seem surprising, but because end users can enjoy Spotify while offline, there are some complications around deduplication of data that is re-sent. For example, if we detect that we are missing a data point, we don’t necessarily know if it is actually lost, or just has not arrived yet due to the user being offline, in a tunnel, or maybe having a flaky network connection. This leads to a small percentage of data loss for nearly all the data we collect, which is not acceptable for some types of data. Furthermore, this problem is compounded for datasets generated from a combination of multiple event types in order to “connect the dots” in user journeys where, for example, a single lost event can compromise the whole journey. While we had some specific client code and algorithms to reliably deliver business-critical data exactly once, it was not done in a way that we could extend to all 600+ event types that we had at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eControl plane UX\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe workflow for a customer to progress from “instrumentation to insights” took far too long. Under normal circumstances it would take a customer a week to go through this workflow and get their data. One issue was that multiple components in the EDI had to be schema aware. For example, the receiver service, which is the entry point of the infrastructure, uses the schemas to validate that incoming data is well formed. Due to some tech debt, it took a few hours to propagate the schemas for this validation. This was an eternity in terms of iteration time. Since this process was so painful, some teams tried to instrument their features or services, but then gave up. Some other teams would shoehorn their data into existing data events. This led to gaps in what was instrumented, and a data-quality nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBackwards compatible? Or stuck in the past?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor strategic reasons, it was critical, in 2016, that we build the EDI in GCP and migrate over as quickly as possible. A key decision we took to make this happen was to stay backwards compatible to minimize the migration time. That meant we had to stick with some historical design choices that we would not have if we had built this EDI from scratch. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTab-separated values (TSV):\u003c/strong\u003e All data events were sent as TSV strings. The schemas were parsed and converted to Avro with a Python library created in 2007. The schema-aware tooling for parsing the TSV data was the main cause for the painful control plane UX mentioned earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStateful services:\u003c/strong\u003e Data events were first stored on disk and then forwarded to the EDI. This made us resilient to crashes, but made us vulnerable to data loss if a machine was taken down. Furthermore, Spotify could not take advantage of auto-scaling mechanisms or Kubernetes (without difficult workarounds) because the EDI made our service ecosystem stateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLegacy perimeter:\u003c/strong\u003e Since data events were forwarded from disk to our EDI, all events triggered by Spotify clients needed to be emitted from our perimeter servers. These servers had to keep events on disk and were tightly coupled to our legacy logging mechanism. This caused some pain to perimeter administrators and hindered architectural innovations. Besides the additional complexity in the perimeter, the shared ownership of different teams with different goals caused alignment problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe situation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe had hundreds of services sending events through a legacy EDI by logging data to disk. After being ingested by the infrastructure, events were consumed by hundreds of downstream data pipelines to produce derivative datasets (Figure 2). Our goal was to build a platform that takes advantage of the modern landscape in the cloud while also enabling legacy event types to be migrated easily. The workflow to create new events should be frictionless, while still following our data governance principles and applicable privacy laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"591\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2.png 591w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2-250x128.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2-120x61.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 2: Events produced by our internal services go through the legacy EDI and are consumed by hundreds of data pipelines.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTransitioning event logging to a new infrastructure would need to take into consideration the long tail that mobile app updates have. A new version of our mobile apps takes several months to gain adoption from a high percentage of Spotify end users. We knew that we would have traffic coming to both the old and new EDIs for quite some time. Moreover, events emitted from embedded devices, such as TVs and speakers, would need special treatment as some of these devices are unlikely to ever be upgraded. We call this challenge “The Long Tail Problem”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe strategy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe partially solved “The Long Tail Problem” by designing a data transformation pipeline that reads events from legacy clients, converts them, and feeds them from the legacy EDI into the new infrastructure (Figure 3). Since we were breaking backwards compatibility, we took the opportunity to update our data model. The transformation to the new data model would not have all the necessary information available, so missing or inaccurate fields were expected occasionally. But since this transformation only applied to legacy clients, it would decrease as end users upgraded to the latest version of Spotify. This traffic would become negligible, eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-700x355.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-700x355.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-250x127.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-768x390.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-120x61.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3.png 1286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 3: To handle clients which had not yet upgraded to the latest version, we implemented a job to export legacy data to the new EDI and transform it to our new data model.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe gave data producers two options to adopt the new EDI: either redesign their instrumentation using the new data model, or stick with what they have and turn on exporting data from the legacy EDI to the new EDI. After producers onboarded, event consumers would migrate to read data from the new EDI. If producers and consumers agree to use the exporter, they would first need to update any downstream pipelines to read from the new infrastructure before making client-side changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGet in production with real use cases ASAP\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to validate our decisions, we had to find early adopters to start producing events with the new infrastructure. We presented the advantages and explained the limitations of our alpha product to potential interested teams. It was important to be able to experiment, break, and fix issues fast and safely without worrying about affecting critical production systems or data. Setting expectations with our internal users was important so we could make breaking changes when our assumptions were wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext, we found at least one real use case to migrate. We were looking for something specific, since different event types have different levels of importance, timeliness requirements, and downstream dependencies. We reached out to event owners to understand how their data was being used and how we could help them migrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGiven a set of eligible event types, we identified use cases that were satisfied by the limited features we had built so far. Learning which features our internal users were missing also helped prioritize our roadmap. The more features we added to the new EDI, the more event types we could onboard. We periodically revisited our design decisions and assumptions in order to identify potential problems in the new infrastructure as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we had a prototype that was working with real production traffic, we solidified the interfaces and data model and helped the alpha internal users adapt to the changes (Figure 4). This enabled us to decouple the significant work of migrating the 600+ event types which were running on the legacy infrastructure, and actually building the new EDI behind the abstractions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-700x187.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-700x187.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-250x67.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-768x206.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-1536x411.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-120x32.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 4: New interfaces for the prototype infrastructure, so we could concurrently migrate internal users to the new Event Delivery Infrastructure while building it.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eJust-in-time optimizations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrematurely optimizing is generally a bad idea without motivating metrics. We always want to be as efficient as possible, but we had to prioritize and make trade-offs. Part of the challenge was to find a good balance between the desired efficiency of our infrastructure and the features we absolutely needed to release in order to accomplish our goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe learned from the first EDI that we needed to design for our targeted service availability from the start. Since transactional data collection was not required, there was no need for 100% delivery. We instead had to determine what level of service availability was acceptable and understand the trade-offs associated with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe design changes and decisions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have two main interfaces to the EDI. The control plane is the starting point where internal users declare their events, design their schemas, and bind them to specific SDKs. The data plane receives events sent by those SDKs, divides them by event type, and makes them available as batch datasets or data-streaming topics. The events go through several other components that deduplicate, translate to our well-designed data model, and pseudonymize personal information. The output data is reliably stored for Spotify’s data community to consume and build data pipelines. Due to the evolving needs of internal users, as well as operational overhead and scalability concerns, we needed to make changes between the old and new infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eClient re-sends and new deduplication\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to reduce event loss and improve reliability, we implemented client resends. Due to connection stability and offline mode, these resends may happen immediately, within a few minutes, or maybe several days later. They may never happen! It’s actually impossible to tell if an event has been lost in transport, or if a user has used Spotify and then dropped their phone in the ocean, causing data loss. The combination of resend strategies and flaky network connections complicates things and introduces duplicate events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the old infrastructure, we only deduplicate events within a small window of hours. However, due to the significant increase of duplicates, we hit some bottlenecks and decided to redesign the job. The biggest changes in the new job are the introduction of event message identifiers, and the adoption of Google’s Dataflow processing service instead of Hadoop. The event message identifiers were used to generate lookup indices and remove duplicates. This new strategy allowed us to look back across multiple weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eReceiver service — offline to online\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe legacy EDI used files on disk to store events before they were sent to a receiver service.  Spotify’s access point or other backend services would have their own availability guarantees, and we would read the data from disk eventually. In the new EDI, our receiver service needs its own availability guarantees, which was a paradigm shift in our infrastructure and for our team as \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSREs\u003c/a\u003e. Furthermore, those files on disk were a blocker for Spotify to leverage auto-scaling fleets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the new EDI, we have the receiver service as a highly available API used by SDKs to send events. In case of a receiver service outage, events would be temporarily stored on clients and, eventually, re-sent according to a predefined retry policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eManaged Dataflow\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe wanted the new EDI to leverage cloud-managed services as much as possible. By rebuilding the architecture to run in the cloud, we can offload management responsibilities to Google, and our team can focus on providing additional value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen building the legacy EDI, we needed to migrate a heavy Hadoop job from our on-premise cluster to the cloud. The easiest way was to run the same job on Google’s managed Hadoop solution, Dataproc, so that’s what we did. In the new EDI, the new implementation of that job uses \u003ca href=\"https://spotify.github.io/scio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eScio\u003c/a\u003e (Scala API for Apache Beam) and runs on Google’s Dataflow instead. We considered Spark or Flink, but those had to run over Hadoop, which goes against our strategy to save us operational burden and cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy using Dataflow, we no longer needed to keep long-lived Hadoop clusters to execute our jobs. These clusters had to be big enough to process the largest job without issues, and were overkill for almost everything else. Maintaining these clusters was incredibly expensive. Conversely, Dataflow recycles clusters for every job and supports auto-scaling, allowing us to use and pay only for the resources we need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWrap-up\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we decided to redesign our EDI, we evaluated new technologies and adopted new paradigms available to us in the cloud. We had been operating our old infrastructure for years, and that helped us to understand the main pain points and fragilities. We made decisions based on the technical direction of the company, the industry state of the art, and the known scalability issues with existing components. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe started by first designing new components for the new EDI, which we hacked together into a proof of concept and quickly evolved to a more robust prototype that could be used in production. Shipping as soon as possible was critical to validate the infrastructure end to end and catch issues fast. Having the internal users onboarded early was an important forcing function to keep quality and operational maturity high. Next, we solidified the interfaces to the prototype infrastructure and scaled up traffic by onboarding many noncritical event types. With the interfaces stable, we could improve or change out the internals without friction.

We log a variety of data, from listening history, to results of A/B testing, to page load times so we can analyze and improve the Spotify service. We instrument and log data across every surface that is running Spotify code through a system called the Event Delivery Infrastructure (EDI). Throughout this blog post we make a distinction between the internal users of the EDI, who are Spotify Engineers, Data Scientists, PMs and squads, and end users, who use Spotify as a service and audio platform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2016, we redesigned the EDI in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) when Spotify migrated to the cloud, and we documented the journey in three blog posts (\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/02/25/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-i/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart I\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/03/03/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-ii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart II\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2016/03/10/spotifys-event-delivery-the-road-to-the-cloud-part-iii/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart III\u003c/a\u003e). Not everything went as planned, and we wrote about our learnings from operating our cloud-native EDI in \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2019/11/12/spotifys-event-delivery-life-in-the-cloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePart IV\u003c/a\u003e. Our design was optimized to make it quick and easy for internal developers to instrument and log the data they needed. We then extended it to adapt to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we introduced streaming event delivery in addition to batch, and we brought BigQuery to our data community. We also improved operational stability and the quality of life of our on-call engineers. The peak traffic increased from 1.5M events per second to nearly 8M, and we were ready for that massive scale increase. This increased the total volume of data which we ingested daily to nearly 70TB! (Figure 1).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"436\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-700x436.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-700x436.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-250x156.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-768x478.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1-120x75.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig1.png 1480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 1: Average total volume (TB) of events stored daily by our \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eETL process\u003c/a\u003e (after compression).\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, with that high adoption and traffic increase we discovered some bottlenecks. Our internal users had feature requests and needed more from the system. Now our incomplete and low-quality data was degrading the productivity of the Spotify data community. Whoops!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat was hurting us?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we designed and built the initial EDI, our team had the mission statement to “provide infrastructure for teams at Spotify to reliably collect data, and make it available, safely and efficiently.” The use cases we focused on were well supported, such as music streaming and application monitoring. As other use cases started to appear, the assumptions we made when building the system had to be revisited. During three years of operating and scaling the existing EDI, we gathered a lot of feedback from our internal users and learned a lot about our limitations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eData loss\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost events generated on mobile clients were sent in a fire-and-forget fashion. This might seem surprising, but because end users can enjoy Spotify while offline, there are some complications around deduplication of data that is re-sent. For example, if we detect that we are missing a data point, we don’t necessarily know if it is actually lost, or just has not arrived yet due to the user being offline, in a tunnel, or maybe having a flaky network connection. This leads to a small percentage of data loss for nearly all the data we collect, which is not acceptable for some types of data. Furthermore, this problem is compounded for datasets generated from a combination of multiple event types in order to “connect the dots” in user journeys where, for example, a single lost event can compromise the whole journey. While we had some specific client code and algorithms to reliably deliver business-critical data exactly once, it was not done in a way that we could extend to all 600+ event types that we had at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eControl plane UX\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe workflow for a customer to progress from “instrumentation to insights” took far too long. Under normal circumstances it would take a customer a week to go through this workflow and get their data. One issue was that multiple components in the EDI had to be schema aware. For example, the receiver service, which is the entry point of the infrastructure, uses the schemas to validate that incoming data is well formed. Due to some tech debt, it took a few hours to propagate the schemas for this validation. This was an eternity in terms of iteration time. Since this process was so painful, some teams tried to instrument their features or services, but then gave up. Some other teams would shoehorn their data into existing data events. This led to gaps in what was instrumented, and a data-quality nightmare.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBackwards compatible? Or stuck in the past?\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor strategic reasons, it was critical, in 2016, that we build the EDI in GCP and migrate over as quickly as possible. A key decision we took to make this happen was to stay backwards compatible to minimize the migration time. That meant we had to stick with some historical design choices that we would not have if we had built this EDI from scratch. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTab-separated values (TSV):\u003c/strong\u003e All data events were sent as TSV strings. The schemas were parsed and converted to Avro with a Python library created in 2007. The schema-aware tooling for parsing the TSV data was the main cause for the painful control plane UX mentioned earlier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStateful services:\u003c/strong\u003e Data events were first stored on disk and then forwarded to the EDI. This made us resilient to crashes, but made us vulnerable to data loss if a machine was taken down. Furthermore, Spotify could not take advantage of auto-scaling mechanisms or Kubernetes (without difficult workarounds) because the EDI made our service ecosystem stateful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLegacy perimeter:\u003c/strong\u003e Since data events were forwarded from disk to our EDI, all events triggered by Spotify clients needed to be emitted from our perimeter servers. These servers had to keep events on disk and were tightly coupled to our legacy logging mechanism. This caused some pain to perimeter administrators and hindered architectural innovations. Besides the additional complexity in the perimeter, the shared ownership of different teams with different goals caused alignment problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe situation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe had hundreds of services sending events through a legacy EDI by logging data to disk. After being ingested by the infrastructure, events were consumed by hundreds of downstream data pipelines to produce derivative datasets (Figure 2). Our goal was to build a platform that takes advantage of the modern landscape in the cloud while also enabling legacy event types to be migrated easily. The workflow to create new events should be frictionless, while still following our data governance principles and applicable privacy laws.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"591\" height=\"302\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2.png 591w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2-250x128.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig2-120x61.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 2: Events produced by our internal services go through the legacy EDI and are consumed by hundreds of data pipelines.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTransitioning event logging to a new infrastructure would need to take into consideration the long tail that mobile app updates have. A new version of our mobile apps takes several months to gain adoption from a high percentage of Spotify end users. We knew that we would have traffic coming to both the old and new EDIs for quite some time. Moreover, events emitted from embedded devices, such as TVs and speakers, would need special treatment as some of these devices are unlikely to ever be upgraded. We call this challenge “The Long Tail Problem”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe strategy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe partially solved “The Long Tail Problem” by designing a data transformation pipeline that reads events from legacy clients, converts them, and feeds them from the legacy EDI into the new infrastructure (Figure 3). Since we were breaking backwards compatibility, we took the opportunity to update our data model. The transformation to the new data model would not have all the necessary information available, so missing or inaccurate fields were expected occasionally. But since this transformation only applied to legacy clients, it would decrease as end users upgraded to the latest version of Spotify. This traffic would become negligible, eventually.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"355\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-700x355.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-700x355.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-250x127.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-768x390.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3-120x61.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-Migration_Fig3.png 1286w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 3: To handle clients which had not yet upgraded to the latest version, we implemented a job to export legacy data to the new EDI and transform it to our new data model.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe gave data producers two options to adopt the new EDI: either redesign their instrumentation using the new data model, or stick with what they have and turn on exporting data from the legacy EDI to the new EDI. After producers onboarded, event consumers would migrate to read data from the new EDI. If producers and consumers agree to use the exporter, they would first need to update any downstream pipelines to read from the new infrastructure before making client-side changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGet in production with real use cases ASAP\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to validate our decisions, we had to find early adopters to start producing events with the new infrastructure. We presented the advantages and explained the limitations of our alpha product to potential interested teams. It was important to be able to experiment, break, and fix issues fast and safely without worrying about affecting critical production systems or data. Setting expectations with our internal users was important so we could make breaking changes when our assumptions were wrong.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNext, we found at least one real use case to migrate. We were looking for something specific, since different event types have different levels of importance, timeliness requirements, and downstream dependencies. We reached out to event owners to understand how their data was being used and how we could help them migrate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGiven a set of eligible event types, we identified use cases that were satisfied by the limited features we had built so far. Learning which features our internal users were missing also helped prioritize our roadmap. The more features we added to the new EDI, the more event types we could onboard. We periodically revisited our design decisions and assumptions in order to identify potential problems in the new infrastructure as quickly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we had a prototype that was working with real production traffic, we solidified the interfaces and data model and helped the alpha internal users adapt to the changes (Figure 4). This enabled us to decouple the significant work of migrating the 600+ event types which were running on the legacy infrastructure, and actually building the new EDI behind the abstractions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-700x187.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-700x187.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-250x67.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-768x206.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-1536x411.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4-120x32.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/10/Event-Delivery-MIgration_Fig4.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 4: New interfaces for the prototype infrastructure, so we could concurrently migrate internal users to the new Event Delivery Infrastructure while building it.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eJust-in-time optimizations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrematurely optimizing is generally a bad idea without motivating metrics. We always want to be as efficient as possible, but we had to prioritize and make trade-offs. Part of the challenge was to find a good balance between the desired efficiency of our infrastructure and the features we absolutely needed to release in order to accomplish our goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe learned from the first EDI that we needed to design for our targeted service availability from the start. Since transactional data collection was not required, there was no need for 100% delivery. We instead had to determine what level of service availability was acceptable and understand the trade-offs associated with that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe design changes and decisions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have two main interfaces to the EDI. The control plane is the starting point where internal users declare their events, design their schemas, and bind them to specific SDKs. The data plane receives events sent by those SDKs, divides them by event type, and makes them available as batch datasets or data-streaming topics. The events go through several other components that deduplicate, translate to our well-designed data model, and pseudonymize personal information. The output data is reliably stored for Spotify’s data community to consume and build data pipelines. Due to the evolving needs of internal users, as well as operational overhead and scalability concerns, we needed to make changes between the old and new infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eClient re-sends and new deduplication\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn order to reduce event loss and improve reliability, we implemented client resends. Due to connection stability and offline mode, these resends may happen immediately, within a few minutes, or maybe several days later. They may never happen! It’s actually impossible to tell if an event has been lost in transport, or if a user has used Spotify and then dropped their phone in the ocean, causing data loss. The combination of resend strategies and flaky network connections complicates things and introduces duplicate events.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the old infrastructure, we only deduplicate events within a small window of hours. However, due to the significant increase of duplicates, we hit some bottlenecks and decided to redesign the job. The biggest changes in the new job are the introduction of event message identifiers, and the adoption of Google’s Dataflow processing service instead of Hadoop. The event message identifiers were used to generate lookup indices and remove duplicates. This new strategy allowed us to look back across multiple weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eReceiver service — offline to online\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe legacy EDI used files on disk to store events before they were sent to a receiver service.  Spotify’s access point or other backend services would have their own availability guarantees, and we would read the data from disk eventually. In the new EDI, our receiver service needs its own availability guarantees, which was a paradigm shift in our infrastructure and for our team as \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSREs\u003c/a\u003e. Furthermore, those files on disk were a blocker for Spotify to leverage auto-scaling fleets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the new EDI, we have the receiver service as a highly available API used by SDKs to send events. In case of a receiver service outage, events would be temporarily stored on clients and, eventually, re-sent according to a predefined retry policy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eManaged Dataflow\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe wanted the new EDI to leverage cloud-managed services as much as possible. By rebuilding the architecture to run in the cloud, we can offload management responsibilities to Google, and our team can focus on providing additional value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen building the legacy EDI, we needed to migrate a heavy Hadoop job from our on-premise cluster to the cloud. The easiest way was to run the same job on Google’s managed Hadoop solution, Dataproc, so that’s what we did. In the new EDI, the new implementation of that job uses \u003ca href=\"https://spotify.github.io/scio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eScio\u003c/a\u003e (Scala API for Apache Beam) and runs on Google’s Dataflow instead. We considered Spark or Flink, but those had to run over Hadoop, which goes against our strategy to save us operational burden and cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy using Dataflow, we no longer needed to keep long-lived Hadoop clusters to execute our jobs. These clusters had to be big enough to process the largest job without issues, and were overkill for almost everything else. Maintaining these clusters was incredibly expensive. Conversely, Dataflow recycles clusters for every job and supports auto-scaling, allowing us to use and pay only for the resources we need.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWrap-up\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce we decided to redesign our EDI, we evaluated new technologies and adopted new paradigms available to us in the cloud. We had been operating our old infrastructure for years, and that helped us to understand the main pain points and fragilities. We made decisions based on the technical direction of the company, the industry state of the art, and the known scalability issues with existing components. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe started by first designing new components for the new EDI, which we hacked together into a proof of concept and quickly evolved to a more robust prototype that could be used in production. Shipping as soon as possible was critical to validate the infrastructure end to end and catch issues fast. Having the internal users onboarded early was an important forcing function to keep quality and operational maturity high. Next, we solidified the interfaces to the prototype infrastructure and scaled up traffic by onboarding many noncritical event types. With the interfaces stable, we could improve or change out the internals without friction. This approach decoupled the mass migration from actually rebuilding the infrastructure and reduced wall-clock project time significantly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we neared the end of the migration, we had thrown out nearly all the old, obsolete infrastructure in favor of the state of the art. We successfully changed the wheels of the moving bus, and gave Spotify’s data community a smooth ride.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cp\u003e\n\n        Tags: \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/data/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003eData\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e        \n            \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

After all, Spotify didn’t have access to iPods or the other dedicated digital music players, and besides, at the time, most phones were equipped with only enough memory to hold a handful of songs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen something happened. Smartphones happened. The iPhone happened. Suddenly the idea of creating a piece of software that people could carry around with them everywhere didn’t seem so far-fetched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough it was theoretically possible to create a mobile edition of Spotify, there was still one major issue. A free, offline music app, one that could truly compete with the already-offline MP3 players, just wasn’t in the cards. First off, it couldn’t be free — you can’t click on ads without an internet connection — so it would have to be a paid service. Plus, our listeners already had access to all the music they wanted through piracy. So, once again, we had to ask ourselves something: Why would anyone pay for Spotify? How do you charge for nothing? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd indeed, when we surveyed our users, we discovered that $10 per month — the number we settled on after months of licensing negotiations with labels (more on those in a bit) — was a number literally no one said they would pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWell, at least they \u003cem\u003esaid\u003c/em\u003e that. See, user research is great, but you have to know what it’s really there for. That was our \u003cstrong\u003efirst lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003euser research is for understanding what people \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ethink\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e they will do, not what they will actually do.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a reason for that, as Gustav points out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGustav:\u003c/strong\u003e Humans are not very good at predicting our own future behavior, especially when it comes to what we are prepared to pay for something like convenience. We just can’t imagine our future selves being that lazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eExactly. In other words, just like we discovered while creating the desktop app, convenience is key. Of course people don’t think they would pay for something they were already getting for free — but they just might if it’s a lot more convenient than what they’re using. At least, that’s what we were betting on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe just needed to find another magic trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeware your optimization bias\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat was easier said than done, though. Setting aside the business side of things, actually building a mobile experience convenient enough to convert music pirates was a tall order, one without an obvious solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBack then, in the early days of Spotify, the desktop app may have technically been able to run on the iPhone, but that didn’t mean it was built for it. When Gustav asked Mattias Arrelid, one of Spotify’s early Mac developers, what the challenges were in translating the desktop app into a great mobile product, two things sprang immediately to Mattias’ mind:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e“One [challenge] is that … a phone doesn’t have a constant power supply. For example, it doesn’t have a constant high-bandwidth network connection. Spotify was, at that time, at least leveraging peer to peer … If you do that on the phone, you basically force it to keep the radio on quite a bit. And that is draining in terms of battery.”\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e“The other one is data. [When] you had Spotify running on the desktop, you relied on some kind of data connection that [you] don’t really need to care about … On the phone, you had many contracts that had limited bandwidth included in the monthly allowance. So you really wanted to be careful about your consumption of that.”\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt turns out by developing the desktop app to be as efficient as possible, we were actually developing something that was \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e efficient as a desktop app. Concerns like bandwidth and power consumption never factored into the equation, since you don’t need to worry about them when you’re a desktop user. And that’s where \u003cstrong\u003ethe second lesson\u003c/strong\u003e comes in: \u003cstrong\u003ewhether you realize it or not, you’re always optimizing for something.\u003c/strong\u003e This isn’t always a bad thing — after all, you’re still optimizing — but you are unwittingly creating blind spots for you and your product, ones that can hamper your growth down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the solutions Mattias and the engineering team came up with to improve battery performance involved changing up the codec we used to encode audio. (\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7oB1UYZtOiKqY1Gj3niptG?si=21630574510943f3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDive into the full episode\u003c/a\u003e to hear all the details about why.) But changing up our codec didn’t just have technical ramifications — it had business implications as well, implications that dovetail nicely with our final lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour tech is only half of the story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify didn’t invent streaming, and it was only a matter of time until other companies could start to pull off a service similar to what we were offering. What we needed, in other words, was a breakthrough in our business strategy as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnter licensing. Contrary to what you may expect, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all codec license for streaming songs. Different licenses are required for almost every use case — say, streaming on desktop versus streaming on mobile. This meant that hammering out licensing deals with record labels could end up being a lengthy, complex process. Rather than dealing with these complications, we saw plenty of other companies kick that sort of nitty-gritty work down the road, focusing instead on shipping code and getting to market quicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut to us, this wasn’t a sustainable strategy. So rather than take the same route, Spotify slowed things down, sweating the details in the negotiations for months on end, making sure that we had licenses that no one else had. That way, we could guarantee that we hit the ground running when we introduced a paid mobile tier. Here’s Spotify’s first general counsel, Petra Hansson, on the matter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePetra:\u003c/strong\u003e We spent a lot of time getting those licenses right. Because, you know, back in the day, the norm was more to just sign any licenses and then, you know, try and flip the companies, so it became someone else’s problem or companies would go belly up. So we were sort of hell-bent. And that’s one of the reasons why I joined [Spotify], because what I really liked about the company was that [co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek]’s vision was always to build something long-term and sustainable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs it so happens, truly great product development is more than just a cool new feature or even a breakthrough new technology. \u003cstrong\u003eOur third lesson is that\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003etruly great product development, in short, almost always combines technological innovation with business innovation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s another three lessons down, but there are plenty more to go. The podcast series \u003cem\u003eSpotify: A Product Story\u003c/em\u003e shares all these stories and dozens more, filled with insider insight and product strategy lessons from the employees, collaborators, and musicians who made Spotify what it is today.

How do you charge for nothing? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd indeed, when we surveyed our users, we discovered that $10 per month — the number we settled on after months of licensing negotiations with labels (more on those in a bit) — was a number literally no one said they would pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWell, at least they \u003cem\u003esaid\u003c/em\u003e that. See, user research is great, but you have to know what it’s really there for. That was our \u003cstrong\u003efirst lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003euser research is for understanding what people \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ethink\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e they will do, not what they will actually do.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a reason for that, as Gustav points out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGustav:\u003c/strong\u003e Humans are not very good at predicting our own future behavior, especially when it comes to what we are prepared to pay for something like convenience. We just can’t imagine our future selves being that lazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eExactly. In other words, just like we discovered while creating the desktop app, convenience is key. Of course people don’t think they would pay for something they were already getting for free — but they just might if it’s a lot more convenient than what they’re using. At least, that’s what we were betting on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe just needed to find another magic trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeware your optimization bias\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat was easier said than done, though. Setting aside the business side of things, actually building a mobile experience convenient enough to convert music pirates was a tall order, one without an obvious solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBack then, in the early days of Spotify, the desktop app may have technically been able to run on the iPhone, but that didn’t mean it was built for it. When Gustav asked Mattias Arrelid, one of Spotify’s early Mac developers, what the challenges were in translating the desktop app into a great mobile product, two things sprang immediately to Mattias’ mind:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e“One [challenge] is that … a phone doesn’t have a constant power supply. For example, it doesn’t have a constant high-bandwidth network connection. Spotify was, at that time, at least leveraging peer to peer … If you do that on the phone, you basically force it to keep the radio on quite a bit. And that is draining in terms of battery.”\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e“The other one is data. [When] you had Spotify running on the desktop, you relied on some kind of data connection that [you] don’t really need to care about … On the phone, you had many contracts that had limited bandwidth included in the monthly allowance. So you really wanted to be careful about your consumption of that.”\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt turns out by developing the desktop app to be as efficient as possible, we were actually developing something that was \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e efficient as a desktop app. Concerns like bandwidth and power consumption never factored into the equation, since you don’t need to worry about them when you’re a desktop user. And that’s where \u003cstrong\u003ethe second lesson\u003c/strong\u003e comes in: \u003cstrong\u003ewhether you realize it or not, you’re always optimizing for something.\u003c/strong\u003e This isn’t always a bad thing — after all, you’re still optimizing — but you are unwittingly creating blind spots for you and your product, ones that can hamper your growth down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the solutions Mattias and the engineering team came up with to improve battery performance involved changing up the codec we used to encode audio. (\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7oB1UYZtOiKqY1Gj3niptG?si=21630574510943f3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDive into the full episode\u003c/a\u003e to hear all the details about why.) But changing up our codec didn’t just have technical ramifications — it had business implications as well, implications that dovetail nicely with our final lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour tech is only half of the story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify didn’t invent streaming, and it was only a matter of time until other companies could start to pull off a service similar to what we were offering. What we needed, in other words, was a breakthrough in our business strategy as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnter licensing. Contrary to what you may expect, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all codec license for streaming songs. Different licenses are required for almost every use case — say, streaming on desktop versus streaming on mobile. This meant that hammering out licensing deals with record labels could end up being a lengthy, complex process. Rather than dealing with these complications, we saw plenty of other companies kick that sort of nitty-gritty work down the road, focusing instead on shipping code and getting to market quicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut to us, this wasn’t a sustainable strategy. So rather than take the same route, Spotify slowed things down, sweating the details in the negotiations for months on end, making sure that we had licenses that no one else had. That way, we could guarantee that we hit the ground running when we introduced a paid mobile tier. Here’s Spotify’s first general counsel, Petra Hansson, on the matter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePetra:\u003c/strong\u003e We spent a lot of time getting those licenses right. Because, you know, back in the day, the norm was more to just sign any licenses and then, you know, try and flip the companies, so it became someone else’s problem or companies would go belly up. So we were sort of hell-bent. And that’s one of the reasons why I joined [Spotify], because what I really liked about the company was that [co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek]’s vision was always to build something long-term and sustainable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs it so happens, truly great product development is more than just a cool new feature or even a breakthrough new technology. \u003cstrong\u003eOur third lesson is that\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003etruly great product development, in short, almost always combines technological innovation with business innovation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s another three lessons down, but there are plenty more to go.

After all, Spotify didn’t have access to iPods or the other dedicated digital music players, and besides, at the time, most phones were equipped with only enough memory to hold a handful of songs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen something happened. Smartphones happened. The iPhone happened. Suddenly the idea of creating a piece of software that people could carry around with them everywhere didn’t seem so far-fetched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough it was theoretically possible to create a mobile edition of Spotify, there was still one major issue. A free, offline music app, one that could truly compete with the already-offline MP3 players, just wasn’t in the cards. First off, it couldn’t be free — you can’t click on ads without an internet connection — so it would have to be a paid service. Plus, our listeners already had access to all the music they wanted through piracy. So, once again, we had to ask ourselves something: Why would anyone pay for Spotify?

Why was it so difficult to create Spotify for mobile even after we created the desktop app? Why were Spotify’s licensing deals such a game changer for us? Keep reading to find out the answers, and don’t forget to \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3L9tzrt0CthF6hNkxYIeSB?si=pX_Ez7ZHR3untiFXd5WaNA\u0026amp;dl_branch=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003elisten to the podcast\u003c/a\u003e itself to learn even more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat’s user research really for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we first released the Spotify desktop app in Sweden in 2008, the idea of creating an on-the-go version of that same experience seemed out of the question. After all, Spotify didn’t have access to iPods or the other dedicated digital music players, and besides, at the time, most phones were equipped with only enough memory to hold a handful of songs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThen something happened. Smartphones happened. The iPhone happened. Suddenly the idea of creating a piece of software that people could carry around with them everywhere didn’t seem so far-fetched.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThough it was theoretically possible to create a mobile edition of Spotify, there was still one major issue. A free, offline music app, one that could truly compete with the already-offline MP3 players, just wasn’t in the cards. First off, it couldn’t be free — you can’t click on ads without an internet connection — so it would have to be a paid service. Plus, our listeners already had access to all the music they wanted through piracy. So, once again, we had to ask ourselves something: Why would anyone pay for Spotify? How do you charge for nothing? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd indeed, when we surveyed our users, we discovered that $10 per month — the number we settled on after months of licensing negotiations with labels (more on those in a bit) — was a number literally no one said they would pay.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWell, at least they \u003cem\u003esaid\u003c/em\u003e that. See, user research is great, but you have to know what it’s really there for. That was our \u003cstrong\u003efirst lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003euser research is for understanding what people \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ethink\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e they will do, not what they will actually do.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a reason for that, as Gustav points out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGustav:\u003c/strong\u003e Humans are not very good at predicting our own future behavior, especially when it comes to what we are prepared to pay for something like convenience. We just can’t imagine our future selves being that lazy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eExactly. In other words, just like we discovered while creating the desktop app, convenience is key. Of course people don’t think they would pay for something they were already getting for free — but they just might if it’s a lot more convenient than what they’re using. At least, that’s what we were betting on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe just needed to find another magic trick.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeware your optimization bias\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat was easier said than done, though. Setting aside the business side of things, actually building a mobile experience convenient enough to convert music pirates was a tall order, one without an obvious solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBack then, in the early days of Spotify, the desktop app may have technically been able to run on the iPhone, but that didn’t mean it was built for it. When Gustav asked Mattias Arrelid, one of Spotify’s early Mac developers, what the challenges were in translating the desktop app into a great mobile product, two things sprang immediately to Mattias’ mind:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e“One [challenge] is that … a phone doesn’t have a constant power supply. For example, it doesn’t have a constant high-bandwidth network connection. Spotify was, at that time, at least leveraging peer to peer … If you do that on the phone, you basically force it to keep the radio on quite a bit. And that is draining in terms of battery.”\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e“The other one is data. [When] you had Spotify running on the desktop, you relied on some kind of data connection that [you] don’t really need to care about … On the phone, you had many contracts that had limited bandwidth included in the monthly allowance. So you really wanted to be careful about your consumption of that.”\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt turns out by developing the desktop app to be as efficient as possible, we were actually developing something that was \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e efficient as a desktop app. Concerns like bandwidth and power consumption never factored into the equation, since you don’t need to worry about them when you’re a desktop user. And that’s where \u003cstrong\u003ethe second lesson\u003c/strong\u003e comes in: \u003cstrong\u003ewhether you realize it or not, you’re always optimizing for something.\u003c/strong\u003e This isn’t always a bad thing — after all, you’re still optimizing — but you are unwittingly creating blind spots for you and your product, ones that can hamper your growth down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the solutions Mattias and the engineering team came up with to improve battery performance involved changing up the codec we used to encode audio. (\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7oB1UYZtOiKqY1Gj3niptG?si=21630574510943f3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eDive into the full episode\u003c/a\u003e to hear all the details about why.) But changing up our codec didn’t just have technical ramifications — it had business implications as well, implications that dovetail nicely with our final lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour tech is only half of the story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify didn’t invent streaming, and it was only a matter of time until other companies could start to pull off a service similar to what we were offering. What we needed, in other words, was a breakthrough in our business strategy as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEnter licensing. Contrary to what you may expect, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all codec license for streaming songs. Different licenses are required for almost every use case — say, streaming on desktop versus streaming on mobile. This meant that hammering out licensing deals with record labels could end up being a lengthy, complex process. Rather than dealing with these complications, we saw plenty of other companies kick that sort of nitty-gritty work down the road, focusing instead on shipping code and getting to market quicker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut to us, this wasn’t a sustainable strategy. So rather than take the same route, Spotify slowed things down, sweating the details in the negotiations for months on end, making sure that we had licenses that no one else had. That way, we could guarantee that we hit the ground running when we introduced a paid mobile tier. Here’s Spotify’s first general counsel, Petra Hansson, on the matter:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePetra:\u003c/strong\u003e We spent a lot of time getting those licenses right. Because, you know, back in the day, the norm was more to just sign any licenses and then, you know, try and flip the companies, so it became someone else’s problem or companies would go belly up. So we were sort of hell-bent. And that’s one of the reasons why I joined [Spotify], because what I really liked about the company was that [co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek]’s vision was always to build something long-term and sustainable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs it so happens, truly great product development is more than just a cool new feature or even a breakthrough new technology. \u003cstrong\u003eOur third lesson is that\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003etruly great product development, in short, almost always combines technological innovation with business innovation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s another three lessons down, but there are plenty more to go. The podcast series \u003cem\u003eSpotify: A Product Story\u003c/em\u003e shares all these stories and dozens more, filled with insider insight and product strategy lessons from the employees, collaborators, and musicians who made Spotify what it is today.

Is it by measuring something arbitrary, like how many lines of code they’ve written or how many commits they’ve made? Nope. How much useful data are you really getting out of those numbers anyway?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, it’s more helpful to think of performance in terms of “developer effectiveness”. Suddenly, it’s not about the quantity of work and time spent, but the quality. Are engineers wasting a bunch of their days just trying to find what they need to get started, or are they able to jump straight into the work they really want to do with as few blockers as possible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePia Nilsson, Director of Engineering and Head of Platform Developer Experience at Spotify, addressed these and other questions on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/podcasts/technology-podcasts/developer-effectiveness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThoughtworks\u003c/em\u003e podcast\u003c/a\u003e: What types of problems do Spotify engineers face? And why did we create \u003ca href=\"http://backstage.spotify.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBackstage\u003c/a\u003e to address those issues? Read on to find out how exactly Backstage helped us, and how you can use Backstage to boost the effectiveness of your own team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGrowing pains\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Pia explains in the podcast, when she started at Spotify in 2016, we were facing an interesting problem. We were in the middle of a hiring boom during a period of exponential growth. From the outside, everything seemed to be moving along swimmingly. But internally, a few metrics were giving us pause; specifically, our productivity wasn’t increasing at all, even with all the new hires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo we did what we always do: we looked at the data. We had a few metrics for determining and monitoring developer effectiveness — deployment frequency, for instance — but the most crucial was our onboarding metric. You see, we gauge how well our onboarding process is working by measuring how long it takes for a new engineer to make their tenth pull request. And in the midst of our hiring frenzy, that number was getting incredibly high: over 60 days. Clearly something had to be done, but what were the issues developers were facing to begin with?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePia and her team looked into the issue, and this was the feedback she got back from the engineers, in her own words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e“First, it was the context switching … because we had a very fragmented ecosystem. Why did we have a fragmented ecosystem? … Every single team is like a little startup, and it’s free to charge ahead and reach their mission by themselves … This is very conducive for speed, but when we grow, that’s where stuff starts to break down. Of course, this leads to a lot of cognitive load for our engineers.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e“The number two blocker was that it’s just hard to find things. Which service should I be integrating with as an engineer? Should I use the user data service that the customer service team has built? Or should I use the slightly different user data service that the premium team has built? Or should I just go ahead and build my own? This, of course, leads to further fragmentation, and we’re back to problem number one.”\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering both of these challenges, it’s clear that as Spotify grew, our famously autonomous culture was also driving our working environment to become increasingly convoluted and disparate. No one was on the same page, and it was starting to weigh us down. The obvious solution, of course, would be to mandate our engineers use the same technologies and microservices so that we started acting more as a monolith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut that just wouldn’t fly at Spotify. Again, our autonomous culture, and all the freedom that comes with it, was a big reason a lot of people liked working at Spotify to begin with. It’s key to our identity. Mandating our problems away was out of the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else could we do? What we needed was a solution that prioritized developers and their ways of working. What we needed was a place where everyone could go to find everything they needed, no matter what it was. What we needed was Backstage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eBackstage: a platform for your platforms\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Pia notes, Spotify developed \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/03/17/what-the-heck-is-backstage-anyway/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBackstage\u003c/a\u003e to help our engineers do three different things: find stuff, manage stuff, and create stuff. In other words, it’s built to address all the blockers our engineers were facing, especially in terms of discoverability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere our engineers used to spend hours of their week just looking for things — documentation, platforms, systems and their owners — all over the internet, now they can find everything in one place: Backstage. Similarly, rather than moving from tab to tab, checking to see the health of, say, their Kubernetes clusters or the status of their recent deployment, engineers can now use Backstage to bring together monitoring tools, logging, their CI/CD pipeline, and whatever else our engineers needed to manage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, let’s say our engineers want to spin up a new ML model, data pipeline, or some other component or microservice. Rather than building something on their own, introducing yet another instance of boilerplate code similar to a dozen others in our ecosystem, they can now use Backstage to do that work for them. Not only does this save them time if they choose to do this, but these new components and services are also set up using our own best practices and tech standards — what we call our \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/17/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eGolden Paths\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this, we’re able to have our cake and eat it too.

We were in the middle of a hiring boom during a period of exponential growth. From the outside, everything seemed to be moving along swimmingly. But internally, a few metrics were giving us pause; specifically, our productivity wasn’t increasing at all, even with all the new hires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo we did what we always do: we looked at the data. We had a few metrics for determining and monitoring developer effectiveness — deployment frequency, for instance — but the most crucial was our onboarding metric. You see, we gauge how well our onboarding process is working by measuring how long it takes for a new engineer to make their tenth pull request. And in the midst of our hiring frenzy, that number was getting incredibly high: over 60 days. Clearly something had to be done, but what were the issues developers were facing to begin with?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePia and her team looked into the issue, and this was the feedback she got back from the engineers, in her own words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e“First, it was the context switching … because we had a very fragmented ecosystem. Why did we have a fragmented ecosystem? … Every single team is like a little startup, and it’s free to charge ahead and reach their mission by themselves … This is very conducive for speed, but when we grow, that’s where stuff starts to break down. Of course, this leads to a lot of cognitive load for our engineers.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e“The number two blocker was that it’s just hard to find things. Which service should I be integrating with as an engineer? Should I use the user data service that the customer service team has built? Or should I use the slightly different user data service that the premium team has built? Or should I just go ahead and build my own? This, of course, leads to further fragmentation, and we’re back to problem number one.”\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering both of these challenges, it’s clear that as Spotify grew, our famously autonomous culture was also driving our working environment to become increasingly convoluted and disparate. No one was on the same page, and it was starting to weigh us down. The obvious solution, of course, would be to mandate our engineers use the same technologies and microservices so that we started acting more as a monolith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut that just wouldn’t fly at Spotify. Again, our autonomous culture, and all the freedom that comes with it, was a big reason a lot of people liked working at Spotify to begin with. It’s key to our identity. Mandating our problems away was out of the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else could we do? What we needed was a solution that prioritized developers and their ways of working. What we needed was a place where everyone could go to find everything they needed, no matter what it was. What we needed was Backstage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eBackstage: a platform for your platforms\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Pia notes, Spotify developed \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/03/17/what-the-heck-is-backstage-anyway/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBackstage\u003c/a\u003e to help our engineers do three different things: find stuff, manage stuff, and create stuff.

Suddenly, it’s not about the quantity of work and time spent, but the quality. Are engineers wasting a bunch of their days just trying to find what they need to get started, or are they able to jump straight into the work they really want to do with as few blockers as possible?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePia Nilsson, Director of Engineering and Head of Platform Developer Experience at Spotify, addressed these and other questions on the \u003ca href=\"https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/podcasts/technology-podcasts/developer-effectiveness\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThoughtworks\u003c/em\u003e podcast\u003c/a\u003e: What types of problems do Spotify engineers face? And why did we create \u003ca href=\"http://backstage.spotify.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBackstage\u003c/a\u003e to address those issues? Read on to find out how exactly Backstage helped us, and how you can use Backstage to boost the effectiveness of your own team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGrowing pains\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Pia explains in the podcast, when she started at Spotify in 2016, we were facing an interesting problem. We were in the middle of a hiring boom during a period of exponential growth. From the outside, everything seemed to be moving along swimmingly. But internally, a few metrics were giving us pause; specifically, our productivity wasn’t increasing at all, even with all the new hires.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo we did what we always do: we looked at the data. We had a few metrics for determining and monitoring developer effectiveness — deployment frequency, for instance — but the most crucial was our onboarding metric. You see, we gauge how well our onboarding process is working by measuring how long it takes for a new engineer to make their tenth pull request. And in the midst of our hiring frenzy, that number was getting incredibly high: over 60 days. Clearly something had to be done, but what were the issues developers were facing to begin with?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePia and her team looked into the issue, and this was the feedback she got back from the engineers, in her own words:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e“First, it was the context switching … because we had a very fragmented ecosystem. Why did we have a fragmented ecosystem? … Every single team is like a little startup, and it’s free to charge ahead and reach their mission by themselves … This is very conducive for speed, but when we grow, that’s where stuff starts to break down. Of course, this leads to a lot of cognitive load for our engineers.”\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e“The number two blocker was that it’s just hard to find things. Which service should I be integrating with as an engineer? Should I use the user data service that the customer service team has built? Or should I use the slightly different user data service that the premium team has built? Or should I just go ahead and build my own? This, of course, leads to further fragmentation, and we’re back to problem number one.”\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eConsidering both of these challenges, it’s clear that as Spotify grew, our famously autonomous culture was also driving our working environment to become increasingly convoluted and disparate. No one was on the same page, and it was starting to weigh us down. The obvious solution, of course, would be to mandate our engineers use the same technologies and microservices so that we started acting more as a monolith.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut that just wouldn’t fly at Spotify. Again, our autonomous culture, and all the freedom that comes with it, was a big reason a lot of people liked working at Spotify to begin with. It’s key to our identity. Mandating our problems away was out of the question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat else could we do? What we needed was a solution that prioritized developers and their ways of working. What we needed was a place where everyone could go to find everything they needed, no matter what it was. What we needed was Backstage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eBackstage: a platform for your platforms\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Pia notes, Spotify developed \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/03/17/what-the-heck-is-backstage-anyway/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBackstage\u003c/a\u003e to help our engineers do three different things: find stuff, manage stuff, and create stuff. In other words, it’s built to address all the blockers our engineers were facing, especially in terms of discoverability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhere our engineers used to spend hours of their week just looking for things — documentation, platforms, systems and their owners — all over the internet, now they can find everything in one place: Backstage. Similarly, rather than moving from tab to tab, checking to see the health of, say, their Kubernetes clusters or the status of their recent deployment, engineers can now use Backstage to bring together monitoring tools, logging, their CI/CD pipeline, and whatever else our engineers needed to manage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, let’s say our engineers want to spin up a new ML model, data pipeline, or some other component or microservice. Rather than building something on their own, introducing yet another instance of boilerplate code similar to a dozen others in our ecosystem, they can now use Backstage to do that work for them. Not only does this save them time if they choose to do this, but these new components and services are also set up using our own best practices and tech standards — what we call our \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/17/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eGolden Paths\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause of this, we’re able to have our cake and eat it too. Our engineers and squads can remain entirely autonomous, even as Backstage nudges them toward walking down these Golden Paths, thereby increasing our teams’ alignment and keeping our ecosystem from becoming more fragmented. Additionally, because \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/backstage/backstage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBackstage is a rapidly growing open source tool\u003c/a\u003e, more and more features and plugins are constantly being added for a variety of use cases beyond the ones mentioned here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, with all that being said, was Backstage worth all the time and money we invested into it? Well, let’s go back to the onboarding metrics one more time. Remember when Pia discovered that it took over 60 days for onboarding engineers to merge their tenth pull request? After Backstage was introduced, that number dropped to only 20. “And if you have numbers like that in your organization,” mentions Pia, “I find that it’s easy to get buy-in for investments in developer experience.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eInterested in hearing more about Backstage and what it can do for you?

Pedalboard makes it easy to use studio-quality audio effects in your code, rather than just in your digital audio workstation (DAW).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you ask any music or podcast producer where they spend most of their time, chances are they’ll say their DAW — the app that lets them edit, manipulate, and perfect their audio. DAWs are powerful software packages that are used in the production of the vast majority of audio today. Most music or podcast content that you hear on Spotify has probably been processed through popular DAWs like Ableton Live, Logic Pro\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e, or Pro Tools\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e, or newer, more accessible tools like \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.soundtrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundtrap\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://anchor.fm/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnchor\u003c/a\u003e. These apps are optimized for high performance and audio quality, and give producers both incredible flexibility and control over their audio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis ability to play with sound is usually relegated to DAWs, and these apps are built for musicians, not programmers. But what if programmers want to use the power, speed, and sound quality of a DAW in their code? The engineers and researchers at \u003ca href=\"https://research.atspotify.com/audio-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify’s Audio Intelligence Lab\u003c/a\u003e found themselves with that exact need as part of their cutting-edge audio research. They found that each existing solution met some (but not all) of the criteria they needed — so instead, they built their own.

It’s built on top of \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://juce.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJUCE\u003c/a\u003e, the industry-standard framework for performant and reliable audio applications. Just like a professional DAW, Pedalboard supports a number of built-in audio effects, as well as third-party VST3\u003csup\u003e® \u003c/sup\u003eand Audio Unit plugins. And just like a DAW, Pedalboard prioritizes speed and quality: in basic tests on common developer hardware, it’s up to 300 times faster than the currently widely used packages for Python audio effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to the pedalboards used by guitar players, Pedalboard includes a variety of common stylistic effects and augmentations that you can use to alter sounds. You’ll find basic tools to control volume, like a noise gate, compressor, and limiter, as well as more stylistic tools like distortion, phaser, filter, and reverb. Pedalboard even includes a built-in convolution operator for high-quality simulation of speakers and microphones. If that’s not enough, any VST3\u003csup\u003e® \u003c/sup\u003eor Audio Unit effect plugin can be loaded to provide access to more sonic possibilities. Once you’ve got the sound you’re looking for, you can save your effects by grouping plugins together into a pedalboard, which has the added benefit of speeding up processing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"538\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-700x538.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-700x538.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-250x192.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-768x591.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-1536x1181.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-120x92.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2.png 1874w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve found a number of great uses for Pedalboard at Spotify so far, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMachine Learning (ML):\u003c/strong\u003e Pedalboard makes the process of \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edata augmentation\u003c/a\u003e for audio dramatically faster and produces more realistic results. Using Pedalboard, it’s easy to take a small dataset and augment it with audio effects — adding reverb, compression, distortion, and more — to vastly increase the size of your model’s training data and increase your model’s performance. Pedalboard has been thoroughly tested in high-performance and high-reliability ML use cases at Spotify, and is used heavily with TensorFlow.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContent Creation: \u003c/strong\u003ePedalboard makes it easy to script the application of audio effects with small amounts of Python code. This can help automate parts of the audio creation process. Applying a VST3\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e or Audio Unit plugin no longer requires launching your DAW, importing audio, and exporting it; a couple of lines of code can do it all in one command, or as part of a larger workflow.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCreativity:\u003c/strong\u003e Artists, musicians, and producers with a bit of Python knowledge can use Pedalboard to produce new creative effects that would be extremely time consuming and difficult to produce in a DAW.

Pedalboard makes it easy to use studio-quality audio effects in your code, rather than just in your digital audio workstation (DAW).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you ask any music or podcast producer where they spend most of their time, chances are they’ll say their DAW — the app that lets them edit, manipulate, and perfect their audio. DAWs are powerful software packages that are used in the production of the vast majority of audio today. Most music or podcast content that you hear on Spotify has probably been processed through popular DAWs like Ableton Live, Logic Pro\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e, or Pro Tools\u003csup\u003e®\u003c/sup\u003e, or newer, more accessible tools like \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.soundtrap.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSoundtrap\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://anchor.fm/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnchor\u003c/a\u003e. These apps are optimized for high performance and audio quality, and give producers both incredible flexibility and control over their audio.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis ability to play with sound is usually relegated to DAWs, and these apps are built for musicians, not programmers. But what if programmers want to use the power, speed, and sound quality of a DAW in their code? The engineers and researchers at \u003ca href=\"https://research.atspotify.com/audio-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify’s Audio Intelligence Lab\u003c/a\u003e found themselves with that exact need as part of their cutting-edge audio research.

It’s built on top of \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://juce.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJUCE\u003c/a\u003e, the industry-standard framework for performant and reliable audio applications. Just like a professional DAW, Pedalboard supports a number of built-in audio effects, as well as third-party VST3\u003csup\u003e® \u003c/sup\u003eand Audio Unit plugins. And just like a DAW, Pedalboard prioritizes speed and quality: in basic tests on common developer hardware, it’s up to 300 times faster than the currently widely used packages for Python audio effects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSimilar to the pedalboards used by guitar players, Pedalboard includes a variety of common stylistic effects and augmentations that you can use to alter sounds. You’ll find basic tools to control volume, like a noise gate, compressor, and limiter, as well as more stylistic tools like distortion, phaser, filter, and reverb. Pedalboard even includes a built-in convolution operator for high-quality simulation of speakers and microphones. If that’s not enough, any VST3\u003csup\u003e® \u003c/sup\u003eor Audio Unit effect plugin can be loaded to provide access to more sonic possibilities. Once you’ve got the sound you’re looking for, you can save your effects by grouping plugins together into a pedalboard, which has the added benefit of speeding up processing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"538\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-700x538.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-700x538.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-250x192.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-768x591.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-1536x1181.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2-120x92.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/09/Pedalboard_Audio_Effects_2.png 1874w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve found a number of great uses for Pedalboard at Spotify so far, including:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMachine Learning (ML):\u003c/strong\u003e Pedalboard makes the process of \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_augmentation\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edata augmentation\u003c/a\u003e for audio dramatically faster and produces more realistic results.

At this point, music piracy wasn’t a new phenomenon, but it was a newly popular one. No longer did you have to physically steal records, rip radio onto a cassette, or even burn a CD. With peer-to-peer technology, all it took was an internet connection and some software, and you could be moments away from nabbing a song for yourself, with almost no chance of getting punished for it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSure, download speeds could be painfully slow, the programs were a bit janky, and that album you pirated might turn out to be low-quality, incomplete, or covertly smuggling a virus along with it. But, hey, it was pretty convenient and low risk, all things considered. It was also, most importantly, absolutely free. What could compete?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the very first episode of the podcast, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek remembers considering what it would take to beat piracy at its own game when first conceiving of the company:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaniel: \u003c/strong\u003eI guess if you could take the concept of downloading all the world’s music, like you have on Napster and Kazaa, for a free price or a very low price, and you married it with the user experience of iTunes, so that it would feel like you had all the world’s music on your hard drive — that would be a much better experience than piracy. And then I think everyone would turn to that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, when it comes to guiding your product strategy, \u003cstrong\u003eour\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003efirst lesson is an important rule to live by: convenience trumps everything. \u003c/strong\u003eThe appeal of music piracy for most people, after all, wasn’t to deliberately sabotage the record industry or cut off a revenue stream for artists — it’s that it was free and relatively convenient. After realizing that, Spotify’s mission was set: if we could provide those same things with an even better user experience while still generating revenue, then, and only then, did we have a shot at success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGo big or go home\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut how exactly could we make a user experience \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e good? How could we actually beat pirates at their own game? One obvious improvement was speed; waiting hours over a slow connection to download an album was a massive pain, no matter how free it was. But when we looked at the tech and tools out there, it wasn’t immediately clear how to make anything better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, Spotify co-founder Martin Lorentzon ran into someone who knew how. Enter Ludde Strigeus, the creator of µTorrent, one of the world’s most popular BitTorrent clients and, ironically, one of the largest drivers of music piracy. If there were one person who could promise to push the limits of what client-server technology and P2P networking could do, it was him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLittle surprise, then, that Ludde was fielding offers from Silicon Valley left and right. Even so, he wasn’t in any rush to accept any of them. As he puts it in the podcast, “When I find a project that interests me enough, I can’t really stop working on it. So the problem is to actually find these projects.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBad news for other companies, but great news for us. You see, it’s always good to keep in mind \u003cstrong\u003eour second lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003egreat ambition attracts great talent. This is why companies always need to keep moving the goalposts.\u003c/strong\u003e When Daniel and Martin first approached Ludde to give him the hard sell on Spotify, a company whose goal, again, seemed impossible to achieve at the time, Ludde signed right up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe rules are only suggestions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasn’t long before he identified Spotify’s problem — and the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLudde: \u003c/strong\u003eDoing it in the browser wasn’t even an alternative. There wasn’t any competitive way to do it in the browser at that time. The browsers weren’t mature enough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEssentially, if Spotify ran in a browser, it would only be able to run as fast as the rest of the browser-based internet, which included our competition. That meant that it would never provide a better experience than piracy if we went that route. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, Ludde already knew \u003cstrong\u003eour\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ethird product lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003edon’t be afraid to break the rules. \u003c/strong\u003eThe problem was bigger than just a matter of finding the right tech; for Spotify to be what we wanted, we would need to custom-build everything in our entire infrastructure from the ground up. In short, we would need to go full stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot to go into too much detail here, but at the time, most of the internet was made up of “thin clients,” like web pages or Flash-based clients that ran in-browser, and used more traditional, standardized protocols like HTTPS. Seeing the limitations of that, Ludde and a team of engineers ran in the exact opposite direction, creating a stand-alone “fat client,” building entirely new protocols and hybridizing client-server and P2P technology to suit their own ends.

It was only by rethinking every layer of our infrastructure that we were able to pull Spotify off, to create that magic moment of double-clicking on a new song and having it instantly play. And speaking of magic …\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDo you want to see a magic trick?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of that ambition would have meant nothing if we couldn’t secure the licensing deals we needed to actually play music on our app. We knew our tech was cool and groundbreaking, but would anyone else? The music industry was being ravaged by the same peer-to-peer technology that Spotify was using in the desktop app. Why would they want to strike a deal with someone who seemed like the enemy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Michelle Kadir joined Universal Sweden in 2008 to vet new technologies that could potentially help the ailing music industry, she originally saw Spotify as just another start-up setting up a meeting, vying for her attention. That was, until she saw the product in action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle\u003c/strong\u003e: The thing that happened that was kind of pure magic in that meeting was that [Daniel] did a comparison. He started playing a song on the software, and the song played so quick, so instant … I mean, I don’t know if people remember, but playback was slow back then. Even if you had an MP3 on your computer, and you played it via, you know, Winamp, iTunes, this was faster. And we were like, “You have the files on your computer, right?” And he was like, “No, it’s in the cloud.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s our fourth and final lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003edifferentiating yourself from your competitors is one thing. But if you can pull off something that no one thought was possible — a magic trick — now that’s captivating.\u003c/strong\u003e Captivating enough to potentially change the minds of not only users, but an entire industry that’s stuck in a rut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, sure, that’s four lessons, but why stop there?

So read on to learn how Spotify had to completely rethink peer-to-peer (P2P) networking to improve our user experience, and why everyone needs a bit of magic to stand out from their competitors. And, of course, please \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3L9tzrt0CthF6hNkxYIeSB?si=pX_Ez7ZHR3untiFXd5WaNA\u0026amp;dl_branch=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003echeck out the podcast\u003c/a\u003e yourself to hear even more about how Spotify became, well, Spotify.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow do you steal from a pirate?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s rewind to the mid-2000s. At this point, music piracy wasn’t a new phenomenon, but it was a newly popular one. No longer did you have to physically steal records, rip radio onto a cassette, or even burn a CD. With peer-to-peer technology, all it took was an internet connection and some software, and you could be moments away from nabbing a song for yourself, with almost no chance of getting punished for it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSure, download speeds could be painfully slow, the programs were a bit janky, and that album you pirated might turn out to be low-quality, incomplete, or covertly smuggling a virus along with it. But, hey, it was pretty convenient and low risk, all things considered. It was also, most importantly, absolutely free. What could compete?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the very first episode of the podcast, Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek remembers considering what it would take to beat piracy at its own game when first conceiving of the company:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaniel: \u003c/strong\u003eI guess if you could take the concept of downloading all the world’s music, like you have on Napster and Kazaa, for a free price or a very low price, and you married it with the user experience of iTunes, so that it would feel like you had all the world’s music on your hard drive — that would be a much better experience than piracy. And then I think everyone would turn to that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, when it comes to guiding your product strategy, \u003cstrong\u003eour\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003efirst lesson is an important rule to live by: convenience trumps everything. \u003c/strong\u003eThe appeal of music piracy for most people, after all, wasn’t to deliberately sabotage the record industry or cut off a revenue stream for artists — it’s that it was free and relatively convenient. After realizing that, Spotify’s mission was set: if we could provide those same things with an even better user experience while still generating revenue, then, and only then, did we have a shot at success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eGo big or go home\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut how exactly could we make a user experience \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e good? How could we actually beat pirates at their own game? One obvious improvement was speed; waiting hours over a slow connection to download an album was a massive pain, no matter how free it was. But when we looked at the tech and tools out there, it wasn’t immediately clear how to make anything better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, Spotify co-founder Martin Lorentzon ran into someone who knew how. Enter Ludde Strigeus, the creator of µTorrent, one of the world’s most popular BitTorrent clients and, ironically, one of the largest drivers of music piracy. If there were one person who could promise to push the limits of what client-server technology and P2P networking could do, it was him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLittle surprise, then, that Ludde was fielding offers from Silicon Valley left and right. Even so, he wasn’t in any rush to accept any of them. As he puts it in the podcast, “When I find a project that interests me enough, I can’t really stop working on it. So the problem is to actually find these projects.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBad news for other companies, but great news for us. You see, it’s always good to keep in mind \u003cstrong\u003eour second lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003egreat ambition attracts great talent. This is why companies always need to keep moving the goalposts.\u003c/strong\u003e When Daniel and Martin first approached Ludde to give him the hard sell on Spotify, a company whose goal, again, seemed impossible to achieve at the time, Ludde signed right up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe rules are only suggestions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasn’t long before he identified Spotify’s problem — and the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLudde: \u003c/strong\u003eDoing it in the browser wasn’t even an alternative. There wasn’t any competitive way to do it in the browser at that time. The browsers weren’t mature enough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEssentially, if Spotify ran in a browser, it would only be able to run as fast as the rest of the browser-based internet, which included our competition. That meant that it would never provide a better experience than piracy if we went that route. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, Ludde already knew \u003cstrong\u003eour\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ethird product lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003edon’t be afraid to break the rules. \u003c/strong\u003eThe problem was bigger than just a matter of finding the right tech; for Spotify to be what we wanted, we would need to custom-build everything in our entire infrastructure from the ground up. In short, we would need to go full stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot to go into too much detail here, but at the time, most of the internet was made up of “thin clients,” like web pages or Flash-based clients that ran in-browser, and used more traditional, standardized protocols like HTTPS. Seeing the limitations of that, Ludde and a team of engineers ran in the exact opposite direction, creating a stand-alone “fat client,” building entirely new protocols and hybridizing client-server and P2P technology to suit their own ends. (\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1jHRUXkeiUh44CK4KZQb0h?si=d8695b5f4e58491c\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck out Episode 01, “How do you steal from a pirate?”\u003c/a\u003e, to hear more of that nitty-gritty stuff about persistent TCP connections and how our P2P implementation saved us bandwidth cost.) It was only by rethinking every layer of our infrastructure that we were able to pull Spotify off, to create that magic moment of double-clicking on a new song and having it instantly play. And speaking of magic …\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDo you want to see a magic trick?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of that ambition would have meant nothing if we couldn’t secure the licensing deals we needed to actually play music on our app. We knew our tech was cool and groundbreaking, but would anyone else? The music industry was being ravaged by the same peer-to-peer technology that Spotify was using in the desktop app. Why would they want to strike a deal with someone who seemed like the enemy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Michelle Kadir joined Universal Sweden in 2008 to vet new technologies that could potentially help the ailing music industry, she originally saw Spotify as just another start-up setting up a meeting, vying for her attention. That was, until she saw the product in action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle\u003c/strong\u003e: The thing that happened that was kind of pure magic in that meeting was that [Daniel] did a comparison. He started playing a song on the software, and the song played so quick, so instant … I mean, I don’t know if people remember, but playback was slow back then. Even if you had an MP3 on your computer, and you played it via, you know, Winamp, iTunes, this was faster. And we were like, “You have the files on your computer, right?” And he was like, “No, it’s in the cloud.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s our fourth and final lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003edifferentiating yourself from your competitors is one thing. But if you can pull off something that no one thought was possible — a magic trick — now that’s captivating.\u003c/strong\u003e Captivating enough to potentially change the minds of not only users, but an entire industry that’s stuck in a rut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, sure, that’s four lessons, but why stop there?

But when we looked at the tech and tools out there, it wasn’t immediately clear how to make anything better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLuckily, Spotify co-founder Martin Lorentzon ran into someone who knew how. Enter Ludde Strigeus, the creator of µTorrent, one of the world’s most popular BitTorrent clients and, ironically, one of the largest drivers of music piracy. If there were one person who could promise to push the limits of what client-server technology and P2P networking could do, it was him.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLittle surprise, then, that Ludde was fielding offers from Silicon Valley left and right. Even so, he wasn’t in any rush to accept any of them. As he puts it in the podcast, “When I find a project that interests me enough, I can’t really stop working on it. So the problem is to actually find these projects.” \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBad news for other companies, but great news for us. You see, it’s always good to keep in mind \u003cstrong\u003eour second lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003egreat ambition attracts great talent. This is why companies always need to keep moving the goalposts.\u003c/strong\u003e When Daniel and Martin first approached Ludde to give him the hard sell on Spotify, a company whose goal, again, seemed impossible to achieve at the time, Ludde signed right up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe rules are only suggestions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd it wasn’t long before he identified Spotify’s problem — and the solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLudde: \u003c/strong\u003eDoing it in the browser wasn’t even an alternative. There wasn’t any competitive way to do it in the browser at that time. The browsers weren’t mature enough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEssentially, if Spotify ran in a browser, it would only be able to run as fast as the rest of the browser-based internet, which included our competition. That meant that it would never provide a better experience than piracy if we went that route. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFortunately, Ludde already knew \u003cstrong\u003eour\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ethird product lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003edon’t be afraid to break the rules. \u003c/strong\u003eThe problem was bigger than just a matter of finding the right tech; for Spotify to be what we wanted, we would need to custom-build everything in our entire infrastructure from the ground up. In short, we would need to go full stack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNot to go into too much detail here, but at the time, most of the internet was made up of “thin clients,” like web pages or Flash-based clients that ran in-browser, and used more traditional, standardized protocols like HTTPS. Seeing the limitations of that, Ludde and a team of engineers ran in the exact opposite direction, creating a stand-alone “fat client,” building entirely new protocols and hybridizing client-server and P2P technology to suit their own ends. (\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/1jHRUXkeiUh44CK4KZQb0h?si=d8695b5f4e58491c\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck out Episode 01, “How do you steal from a pirate?”\u003c/a\u003e, to hear more of that nitty-gritty stuff about persistent TCP connections and how our P2P implementation saved us bandwidth cost.) It was only by rethinking every layer of our infrastructure that we were able to pull Spotify off, to create that magic moment of double-clicking on a new song and having it instantly play. And speaking of magic …\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDo you want to see a magic trick?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll of that ambition would have meant nothing if we couldn’t secure the licensing deals we needed to actually play music on our app. We knew our tech was cool and groundbreaking, but would anyone else? The music industry was being ravaged by the same peer-to-peer technology that Spotify was using in the desktop app. Why would they want to strike a deal with someone who seemed like the enemy?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen Michelle Kadir joined Universal Sweden in 2008 to vet new technologies that could potentially help the ailing music industry, she originally saw Spotify as just another start-up setting up a meeting, vying for her attention. That was, until she saw the product in action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMichelle\u003c/strong\u003e: The thing that happened that was kind of pure magic in that meeting was that [Daniel] did a comparison. He started playing a song on the software, and the song played so quick, so instant … I mean, I don’t know if people remember, but playback was slow back then. Even if you had an MP3 on your computer, and you played it via, you know, Winamp, iTunes, this was faster. And we were like, “You have the files on your computer, right?” And he was like, “No, it’s in the cloud.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat’s our fourth and final lesson:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003edifferentiating yourself from your competitors is one thing. But if you can pull off something that no one thought was possible — a magic trick — now that’s captivating.\u003c/strong\u003e Captivating enough to potentially change the minds of not only users, but an entire industry that’s stuck in a rut.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, sure, that’s four lessons, but why stop there? The podcast series “Spotify: A Product Story” shares all these stories and dozens more, filled with insider insight and product strategy lessons from the employees, collaborators, and musicians who made Spotify what it is today.

But over the last year, I’ve transitioned to work more on a new monorepo and Bazel system project that’s designed for all kinds of developers, not just iOS.

Somehow, I’ve become the chef of the group, but I’m more than happy with that…\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"111\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering-700x111.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering-700x111.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering-250x40.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering-768x121.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering-120x19.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering.png 1525w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"557\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/MyBeat-Patrick-Balestra_Pie-chart2-700x557.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/MyBeat-Patrick-Balestra_Pie-chart2-700x557.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/MyBeat-Patrick-Balestra_Pie-chart2-250x199.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/MyBeat-Patrick-Balestra_Pie-chart2-768x611.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/MyBeat-Patrick-Balestra_Pie-chart2-120x96.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/06/MyBeat-Patrick-Balestra_Pie-chart2.png 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\n         Tags: \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/mobile/\" rel=\"tag\"\u003eMobile\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n             Published by Spotify Engineering         \u003c/p\u003e\n     \u003c/div\u003e\n\n     \n     \n\n\n \u003c/article\u003e\n                \n\n            \n        \n    \u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

Meaning: we align on what it is we set out to do, but preserve flexibility to choose how we’ll achieve those goals. Letting teams adjust their processes to work for them promises many benefits (innovation, lower overhead, team happiness, speed, etc.), but it takes intentional team effort to make these adjustments.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this international effort towards aligned autonomy has shown dazzling success and efficiency across the company, my team was struggling to make it work, finding ourselves with a process that wasn’t working for us.

However, we hadn’t connected the Scrum practices we were using — like stand-ups, two-week sprints, and retros — to the principles behind them, and we hadn’t woven them together cohesively as a system. As a result, we found ourselves with a surprising lack of structure and clarity: our meetings often felt purposeless, we never finished our sprints, and our product manager had a difficult time knowing what could reasonably be expected to be delivered at any given time. We, as engineers, also had little sense of how our day-to-day work fit into a larger quarterly picture, or how close our team was to achieving its goals. This left many of us with a gnawing feeling that our team rhythm could be better, though we weren’t quite sure how to get there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe goals we ultimately wanted our process to achieve were:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContinuous improvement: \u003c/strong\u003eWe wanted to iterate better — to easily and fluidly understand our work and find opportunities where we could improve.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShared understanding and transparency: \u003c/strong\u003eWe wanted everyone on the team to know at any given time what work was happening, and what it entailed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col start=\"3\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConfidence: \u003c/strong\u003eWe wanted to be able to more confidently plan our long-term trajectory and communicate with stakeholders about what they could expect.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOur approach\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo help us reach our goals, we sought the help of a Spotify Agile coach, who first guided us through an assessment of our existing ways of working. Since our team generally liked the Scrum framework but wasn’t using it holistically, our Agile coach helped us dig deeper into how the Scrum elements work together as a whole. Each piece has a specific role to play and interacts with each other piece. Ultimately, we unanimously agreed to adopt Scrum more or less “by the book”: that is to say, following the entire framework laid out in the Scrum Guide, rather than just disconnected bits of it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBacklog refinement\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal: Create a shared understanding of each ticket, as well as how “large” it is, so that the PM can prioritize accordingly.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore these process changes, we were itching for a succinct way to size our stories; sometimes stories would get pointed during a planning meeting, but more often than not, we were bringing many unsized stories into a sprint. This meant that we had virtually no gauge of how much work we were bringing in or committing to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith the help of our coach, we began holding a weekly backlog refinement meeting. We alternate each week between “coarse refinement” — in which we hone in on tickets, ask questions, and find collective understanding — and “fine refinement”, in which we actually \u003cem\u003epoint \u003c/em\u003ethose tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis system ensures that everyone has an opportunity to ask questions and shares a basic understanding of every ticket. We all know how much work we are committing to when we begin a sprint, and it also allows us to compare, sprint by sprint, how many points we are finishing as a team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSprint planning\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal: Create a sprint full of stories ready to be picked up, and which we feel confident we can deliver on time.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, our sprint planning process didn’t allow for us to share a collective grasp of each of the tickets in the backlog before our sprint planning ceremony, so we spent most of the two hours reading about the tickets and trying to arrive at an agreement about which ones felt important to bring in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, because all the tickets are pointed and prioritized in the backlog ahead of time, the process is very simple: we go down the backlog — full of tickets we’ve already pointed and discussed — and simply do any subtasking to get clearer on the actual work we’ll be doing. After each ticket we review and bring into the sprint, we check whether the team feels we can take on more. By the end, we have a sprint full of fully subtasked stories we thoroughly understand, and that we’re confident we can deliver within two weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSprint review\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal: Review the sprint’s work, celebrate achievements, and note what new tasks came out of this sprint.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we already had a retro in which we talked vaguely about the successes and challenges of the sprint, we didn’t evaluate the work in terms of our team’s product prioritization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a 30-minute sprint review, we demo the features completed, and ask ourselves some basic questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat work did we complete?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eIs there anything we need to extend or add to what we’ve done?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDid we discover any tech debt?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre we on track to meet our longer-term goals?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis allows us to regroup and reprioritize work accordingly for the next sprint, which begins the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eRetro\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal: Bring team celebrations and concerns to the table; arrive at an action item to implement in order to improve team process.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn previous retros, we all jotted down our notes and talked a little bit about the many things that had come up during the sprint, but we didn’t discuss action items sufficiently in order to implement them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, we continue to create those notes, but then vote on a \u003cem\u003esingle issue \u003c/em\u003eto spend the majority of the retro discussing and ideating to solve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"746\" height=\"787\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Scrum_Retro-Format.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Scrum_Retro-Format.png 746w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Scrum_Retro-Format-250x264.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Scrum_Retro-Format-700x738.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/Scrum_Retro-Format-120x127.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eNow, our retro format takes us step-by-step from ideation at the beginning, to the refining of a single idea at the end.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of the retro, we now have an implementable action item that can be tracked throughout the next few sprints.

However, we hadn’t connected the Scrum practices we were using — like stand-ups, two-week sprints, and retros — to the principles behind them, and we hadn’t woven them together cohesively as a system. As a result, we found ourselves with a surprising lack of structure and clarity: our meetings often felt purposeless, we never finished our sprints, and our product manager had a difficult time knowing what could reasonably be expected to be delivered at any given time. We, as engineers, also had little sense of how our day-to-day work fit into a larger quarterly picture, or how close our team was to achieving its goals.

Since our team generally liked the Scrum framework but wasn’t using it holistically, our Agile coach helped us dig deeper into how the Scrum elements work together as a whole. Each piece has a specific role to play and interacts with each other piece. Ultimately, we unanimously agreed to adopt Scrum more or less “by the book”: that is to say, following the entire framework laid out in the Scrum Guide, rather than just disconnected bits of it. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBacklog refinement\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal: Create a shared understanding of each ticket, as well as how “large” it is, so that the PM can prioritize accordingly.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore these process changes, we were itching for a succinct way to size our stories; sometimes stories would get pointed during a planning meeting, but more often than not, we were bringing many unsized stories into a sprint. This meant that we had virtually no gauge of how much work we were bringing in or committing to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith the help of our coach, we began holding a weekly backlog refinement meeting. We alternate each week between “coarse refinement” — in which we hone in on tickets, ask questions, and find collective understanding — and “fine refinement”, in which we actually \u003cem\u003epoint \u003c/em\u003ethose tickets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis system ensures that everyone has an opportunity to ask questions and shares a basic understanding of every ticket. We all know how much work we are committing to when we begin a sprint, and it also allows us to compare, sprint by sprint, how many points we are finishing as a team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSprint planning\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal: Create a sprint full of stories ready to be picked up, and which we feel confident we can deliver on time.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePreviously, our sprint planning process didn’t allow for us to share a collective grasp of each of the tickets in the backlog before our sprint planning ceremony, so we spent most of the two hours reading about the tickets and trying to arrive at an agreement about which ones felt important to bring in.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, because all the tickets are pointed and prioritized in the backlog ahead of time, the process is very simple: we go down the backlog — full of tickets we’ve already pointed and discussed — and simply do any subtasking to get clearer on the actual work we’ll be doing. After each ticket we review and bring into the sprint, we check whether the team feels we can take on more. By the end, we have a sprint full of fully subtasked stories we thoroughly understand, and that we’re confident we can deliver within two weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eSprint review\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal: Review the sprint’s work, celebrate achievements, and note what new tasks came out of this sprint.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile we already had a retro in which we talked vaguely about the successes and challenges of the sprint, we didn’t evaluate the work in terms of our team’s product prioritization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a 30-minute sprint review, we demo the features completed, and ask ourselves some basic questions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat work did we complete?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eIs there anything we need to extend or add to what we’ve done?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eDid we discover any tech debt?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eAre we on track to meet our longer-term goals?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis allows us to regroup and reprioritize work accordingly for the next sprint, which begins the following day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eRetro\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoal: Bring team celebrations and concerns to the table; arrive at an action item to implement in order to improve team process.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn previous retros, we all jotted down our notes and talked a little bit about the many things that had come up during the sprint, but we didn’t discuss action items sufficiently in order to implement them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, we continue to create those notes, but then vote on a \u003cem\u003esingle issue \u003c/em\u003eto spend the majority of the retro discussing and ideating to solve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"746\" height=\"787\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/05/Scrum_Retro-Format.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/05/Scrum_Retro-Format.png 746w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/05/Scrum_Retro-Format-250x264.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/05/Scrum_Retro-Format-700x738.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/05/Scrum_Retro-Format-120x127.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eNow, our retro format takes us step-by-step from ideation at the beginning, to the refining of a single idea at the end.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of the retro, we now have an implementable action item that can be tracked throughout the next few sprints.

Really, really fast. This should be a great problem to have, except that instead of speeding us up, adding new hires was actually slowing us down. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Director of Engineering Pia Nilsson explains in the podcast, one of the metrics Spotify’s Platform team used to measure productivity was onboarding time: how long did it take for a new engineer to merge their tenth pull request at Spotify? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was not good — over 60 days. That is, from the day an engineer walked through Spotify’s doors, it would be two more months before they were able to contribute code in the form of their tenth pull request. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the number alone doesn’t capture the whole feeling. Gustav Söderström, Spotify’s Chief R\u0026amp;D Officer and the podcast’s host, asks Pia if she remembers what it was like seeing that “60 days” metric for the first time:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGustav\u003c/strong\u003e: Was it like, “Maybe that’s OK”? Or was it like, “That seems super long”?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePia\u003c/strong\u003e: Having spent 15 years as an engineer at other companies, it was like a cold shower.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBrrr. So the first thing Pia’s team had to do was figure out what was putting the chill on new hires. Why did productivity keep dropping as the headcount kept rising?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eEngineers are users, too\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to their own employees, companies will often skip doing user research — after all, why ask when you can just dictate? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Platform team at Spotify sees Spotify’s developers as their customers. Their priorities are our priorities. Their pain points are our problems to solve. So, to find out what was holding back our engineers, the first thing to do was ask our engineers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Pia, two issues emerged as common causes for declining productivity:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContext switching\u003c/strong\u003e: “People are interrupted constantly … New joiners had to tap someone on the shoulder because very seldom was there any documentation.” \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscoverability\u003c/strong\u003e: “People couldn’t find things. It was simple as that. It took forever to just find the right service. There were so many \u003cem\u003ealmost\u003c/em\u003e duplications — not pure duplications — because people are very smart and they would recognize that.” \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be 15 different versions of the same service, each speaking to the slightly different needs of different teams. And if a new team needed a similar service? Instead of sorting through all those versions … they would just build yet another version of the same service for themselves. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a way, this is what worked for Spotify before: small, autonomous teams building fast. But that basic agile approach was reaching its limits. More teams meant more confusion, as evidenced by our onboarding metric. New hires didn’t even know where to begin — let alone how to decipher our “spaghetti” codebase — without tapping another engineer on the shoulder. It was a way of working that was becoming so common, we gave it a name — “\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/17/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003erumour-driven development\u003c/a\u003e”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as Spotify continued to grow, the problem only got worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSpeed, scale, autonomy… pick two?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that the problem was clear, the solution was also obvious: centralization. But just as obvious was the fact that a centralized team will always be much slower than many small teams. Would Spotify have to trade speed for scale?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out, the question was moot. Tasked with restoring productivity, the Platform team realized that a top-down, centralized approach wouldn’t work at Spotify for another, much more fundamental reason: it just wasn’t part of Spotify’s DNA. As Pia explains in the podcast:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“So we basically knew we couldn’t build a centralized solution. It would never work. No one would use it. And no one really believed in it even among ourselves. We had joined Spotify for the reason that we all loved autonomy. We thought that was brilliant to set people free. So the culture really spoke to us there: “Well, you don’t have the option of building something central and mandating everyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat made Spotify engineering great was now slowing it down: too much autonomy. But that culture of autonomy would also lead to an even better solution than a simplistic tech requirements list or top-down mandates. As Spotify’s VP of Engineering, Tyson Singer, says, for Backstage to succeed with our engineers, it had to be the better solution, not the only solution:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“For the most part, if we go out and we tell people to do X, they just shrug, and they do wherever they want. So we really do have to sell to them. We have to basically make their lives better with everything that we do. And so [our culture] really did inform our approach, if we wanted to take control of this fragmentation problem in our tech ecosystem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify wanted something that could give us everything: speed, scale — and a new idea at Spotify — aligned autonomy. And that’s how Backstage was conceived and born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow it’s going: Not just adopted, but embraced\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo if we can’t make anyone use it, how do we know it’s working? Every day, we see the 280 engineering teams inside Spotify use Backstage to manage over 2,000 backend services, 300 websites, 4,000 data pipelines, and 200 mobile features. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven more impressive are the contribution numbers. More than 200 engineers inside Spotify have contributed features to Backstage. We now have 120+ plugins developed by 50+ teams. And 80% of contributions came from Spotifiers outside the Backstage core team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople can find what they need — without constantly interrupting their fellow developers. Any Spotifier — not just engineers, but also compliance and security team members — can easily discover all the software in our ecosystem, see who owns it, and access technical documentation in a centralized location. In an environment optimized for speed and as decentralized as Spotify, having this information so easily accessible makes all the difference. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a company growing as fast as ours, this is a game-changing improvement to both productivity and developer happiness — which we believe go hand in hand. And we know the open source version will be able to transform other tech organizations as well. As a product, Backstage is what happens when you treat your developers with the same thoughtfulness as your users. According to our company-wide surveys, 80% of our internal users are satisfied with Backstage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWant to know what happens next? How much were we able to lower that bone-chilling “60 days to tenth pull request” onboarding metric? How did our homegrown developer portal go on to become Spotify’s biggest open source project?

Really, really fast. This should be a great problem to have, except that instead of speeding us up, adding new hires was actually slowing us down. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs Director of Engineering Pia Nilsson explains in the podcast, one of the metrics Spotify’s Platform team used to measure productivity was onboarding time: how long did it take for a new engineer to merge their tenth pull request at Spotify? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe answer was not good — over 60 days. That is, from the day an engineer walked through Spotify’s doors, it would be two more months before they were able to contribute code in the form of their tenth pull request. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the number alone doesn’t capture the whole feeling. Gustav Söderström, Spotify’s Chief R\u0026amp;D Officer and the podcast’s host, asks Pia if she remembers what it was like seeing that “60 days” metric for the first time:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGustav\u003c/strong\u003e: Was it like, “Maybe that’s OK”? Or was it like, “That seems super long”?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePia\u003c/strong\u003e: Having spent 15 years as an engineer at other companies, it was like a cold shower.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBrrr. So the first thing Pia’s team had to do was figure out what was putting the chill on new hires. Why did productivity keep dropping as the headcount kept rising?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eEngineers are users, too\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to their own employees, companies will often skip doing user research — after all, why ask when you can just dictate? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut the Platform team at Spotify sees Spotify’s developers as their customers. Their priorities are our priorities. Their pain points are our problems to solve. So, to find out what was holding back our engineers, the first thing to do was ask our engineers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Pia, two issues emerged as common causes for declining productivity:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContext switching\u003c/strong\u003e: “People are interrupted constantly … New joiners had to tap someone on the shoulder because very seldom was there any documentation.” \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscoverability\u003c/strong\u003e: “People couldn’t find things. It was simple as that. It took forever to just find the right service. There were so many \u003cem\u003ealmost\u003c/em\u003e duplications — not pure duplications — because people are very smart and they would recognize that.” \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere would be 15 different versions of the same service, each speaking to the slightly different needs of different teams. And if a new team needed a similar service? Instead of sorting through all those versions … they would just build yet another version of the same service for themselves. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a way, this is what worked for Spotify before: small, autonomous teams building fast. But that basic agile approach was reaching its limits. More teams meant more confusion, as evidenced by our onboarding metric. New hires didn’t even know where to begin — let alone how to decipher our “spaghetti” codebase — without tapping another engineer on the shoulder. It was a way of working that was becoming so common, we gave it a name — “\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/17/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003erumour-driven development\u003c/a\u003e”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as Spotify continued to grow, the problem only got worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSpeed, scale, autonomy… pick two?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that the problem was clear, the solution was also obvious: centralization. But just as obvious was the fact that a centralized team will always be much slower than many small teams. Would Spotify have to trade speed for scale?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out, the question was moot. Tasked with restoring productivity, the Platform team realized that a top-down, centralized approach wouldn’t work at Spotify for another, much more fundamental reason: it just wasn’t part of Spotify’s DNA. As Pia explains in the podcast:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“So we basically knew we couldn’t build a centralized solution. It would never work. No one would use it. And no one really believed in it even among ourselves. We had joined Spotify for the reason that we all loved autonomy. We thought that was brilliant to set people free. So the culture really spoke to us there: “Well, you don’t have the option of building something central and mandating everyone.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat made Spotify engineering great was now slowing it down: too much autonomy. But that culture of autonomy would also lead to an even better solution than a simplistic tech requirements list or top-down mandates. As Spotify’s VP of Engineering, Tyson Singer, says, for Backstage to succeed with our engineers, it had to be the better solution, not the only solution:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“For the most part, if we go out and we tell people to do X, they just shrug, and they do wherever they want. So we really do have to sell to them. We have to basically make their lives better with everything that we do. And so [our culture] really did inform our approach, if we wanted to take control of this fragmentation problem in our tech ecosystem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify wanted something that could give us everything: speed, scale — and a new idea at Spotify — aligned autonomy. And that’s how Backstage was conceived and born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow it’s going: Not just adopted, but embraced\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo if we can’t make anyone use it, how do we know it’s working? Every day, we see the 280 engineering teams inside Spotify use Backstage to manage over 2,000 backend services, 300 websites, 4,000 data pipelines, and 200 mobile features. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven more impressive are the contribution numbers. More than 200 engineers inside Spotify have contributed features to Backstage. We now have 120+ plugins developed by 50+ teams. And 80% of contributions came from Spotifiers outside the Backstage core team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople can find what they need — without constantly interrupting their fellow developers. Any Spotifier — not just engineers, but also compliance and security team members — can easily discover all the software in our ecosystem, see who owns it, and access technical documentation in a centralized location. In an environment optimized for speed and as decentralized as Spotify, having this information so easily accessible makes all the difference. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a company growing as fast as ours, this is a game-changing improvement to both productivity and developer happiness — which we believe go hand in hand. And we know the open source version will be able to transform other tech organizations as well. As a product, Backstage is what happens when you treat your developers with the same thoughtfulness as your users. According to our company-wide surveys, 80% of our internal users are satisfied with Backstage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWant to know what happens next? How much were we able to lower that bone-chilling “60 days to tenth pull request” onboarding metric? How did our homegrown developer portal go on to become Spotify’s biggest open source project? And the significance of this humble GIF?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://backstage.io/\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/05/backstage-service-catalog-icon-4.gif\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eListen to episode 08 — “\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7iuQ3ew1Wwpuiq6LbBKzCl\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eWhen to build vs buy — and when to open source\u003c/a\u003e” — to get the whole story.

Their priorities are our priorities. Their pain points are our problems to solve. So, to find out what was holding back our engineers, the first thing to do was ask our engineers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to Pia, two issues emerged as common causes for declining productivity:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContext switching\u003c/strong\u003e: “People are interrupted constantly … New joiners had to tap someone on the shoulder because very seldom was there any documentation.” \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiscoverability\u003c/strong\u003e: “People couldn’t find things.

But that basic agile approach was reaching its limits. More teams meant more confusion, as evidenced by our onboarding metric. New hires didn’t even know where to begin — let alone how to decipher our “spaghetti” codebase — without tapping another engineer on the shoulder. It was a way of working that was becoming so common, we gave it a name — “\u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/08/17/how-we-use-golden-paths-to-solve-fragmentation-in-our-software-ecosystem/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003erumour-driven development\u003c/a\u003e”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd as Spotify continued to grow, the problem only got worse.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSpeed, scale, autonomy… pick two?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that the problem was clear, the solution was also obvious: centralization. But just as obvious was the fact that a centralized team will always be much slower than many small teams. Would Spotify have to trade speed for scale?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTurns out, the question was moot. Tasked with restoring productivity, the Platform team realized that a top-down, centralized approach wouldn’t work at Spotify for another, much more fundamental reason: it just wasn’t part of Spotify’s DNA. As Pia explains in the podcast:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“So we basically knew we couldn’t build a centralized solution. It would never work. No one would use it. And no one really believed in it even among ourselves. We had joined Spotify for the reason that we all loved autonomy. We thought that was brilliant to set people free.

But that culture of autonomy would also lead to an even better solution than a simplistic tech requirements list or top-down mandates. As Spotify’s VP of Engineering, Tyson Singer, says, for Backstage to succeed with our engineers, it had to be the better solution, not the only solution:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“For the most part, if we go out and we tell people to do X, they just shrug, and they do wherever they want.

And so [our culture] really did inform our approach, if we wanted to take control of this fragmentation problem in our tech ecosystem.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify wanted something that could give us everything: speed, scale — and a new idea at Spotify — aligned autonomy. And that’s how Backstage was conceived and born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow it’s going: Not just adopted, but embraced\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo if we can’t make anyone use it, how do we know it’s working? Every day, we see the 280 engineering teams inside Spotify use Backstage to manage over 2,000 backend services, 300 websites, 4,000 data pipelines, and 200 mobile features. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEven more impressive are the contribution numbers. More than 200 engineers inside Spotify have contributed features to Backstage. We now have 120+ plugins developed by 50+ teams. And 80% of contributions came from Spotifiers outside the Backstage core team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePeople can find what they need — without constantly interrupting their fellow developers. Any Spotifier — not just engineers, but also compliance and security team members — can easily discover all the software in our ecosystem, see who owns it, and access technical documentation in a centralized location. In an environment optimized for speed and as decentralized as Spotify, having this information so easily accessible makes all the difference. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor a company growing as fast as ours, this is a game-changing improvement to both productivity and developer happiness — which we believe go hand in hand. And we know the open source version will be able to transform other tech organizations as well. As a product, Backstage is what happens when you treat your developers with the same thoughtfulness as your users.

In this context, we define it as a simplified version of a more complex concept. Abstraction can make some concepts easier by obscuring underlying characters of a system in favor of a more high-level representation. We are looking at abstraction here as a measure of how different the code we write is from the HTML and CSS that is ultimately rendered. For the scope of this piece, we will be discussing abstraction from the lens of frontend development using React, starting with written code through to what is rendered in the browser. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor a more thorough view of abstraction in software, and in life, check out \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@danieljyoo/levels-of-abstraction-a-key-concept-in-systems-design-7fdb33d288af\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLevels of Abstraction, A Key Concept in Systems Design\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e by Daniel Jhin Yoo. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this context, a low level of abstraction would define something that touches CSS or HTML elements directly, whereas a high level of abstraction would define changing custom properties that have their own subjective meaning and value, that in turn modify some underlying CSS or elements within the component.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eCurrent landscape\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we understand what abstraction means in terms of defining web components, let’s take a look at some of the common approaches to handling evolving use cases.

Configurations like enum props allow us to add configuration to our components in a semantic way, while remaining typesafe. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrepacked guidelines\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e Utility classes allow us to modify CSS properties in a granular way that still references the underlying style guide of the design system, and without having to touch CSS directly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProperty passthroughs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e These strategies pass the elements and properties through to ultimately be rendered to the page.

Developers are not tied to the system’s release cadence, which can be very appealing to teams who have pressing deadlines to meet. Not being tied to the constraints of a design system can also provide more freedom and flexibility, which can lead to more innovative approaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCons: Lack of coherency, loss of maintainability, potential duplication\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA local override may solve the problem in a pinch, but those style overrides are less likely to be in close alignment with the system’s broader standards. What’s more, if this pattern emerges more broadly, this local code is not accessible for other feature developers to pick up and use — it would have to be duplicated. Further problems arise if we are looking at more sweeping updates to the design system — any sort of override (think padding, headings, spacing, even colors) made to a local version of the component will stay in place, even if the official version changes drastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eConfiguration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePros: Consistency, contribution, maintainability\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf emerging variations all find their way back to the parent component, then they can be reused and tracked, to ensure that consistency is maintained. If changes need to be made to the main component, folks using the system will need to contribute back to it to meet their needs. As components are updated, consumers may safely upgrade to the latest version with less concern of breaking local overrides in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCons: Can become a bottleneck, rigidness, vocabulary awareness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe other side of the contribution coin — relying on updates to the system means that code must be developed and released in a separate library before it can be used in features. This can slow down feature development, and it introduces a dependency, often on another team. The system also becomes more rigid when consumers are given fewer options — this is good for consistency, but can stifle innovation by setting constraints on how components can be manipulated. Understanding of the abstract vocabulary you have defined in configurations is an additional responsibility maintainers must take on, since you are no longer relying on baseline properties of CSS and HTML that are already thoroughly documented on the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to decide which approach to use\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith both ends of the abstraction spectrum carrying implications for the key functions of your design system, it should come as no surprise that you will end up with a mix of approaches. Here are some factors to consider in deciding what approach is best for your use case:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeature maturity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e If a feature is still taking shape, odds are the design is yet to be fully realized. This isn’t a bad thing — iteration is the name of the game. But when you are still experimenting with what the exact look will be, customization is your friend because you have access to any properties you may realize you need. On the flip side, if you are working with an established component, you have a wealth of existing use cases available to you to reference and establish patterns from, resulting in modifications with a more meaningful configuration for all to use.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduct maturity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e As with feature maturity, the less developed the product is, the harder it is to know what conventions will stick around. If you are seeing a pattern for the first time, customization may be the right move, but if you start to see it emerging in other aspects of the product, use that opportunity to take inventory of your variations and move into a more maintainable configuration approach.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTimeline\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e While design system engineers would rather look at the best-case scenario, the feature teams who consume design systems don’t often have the same luxury. Customization is going to get something out the door quicker, but this is a great opportunity to utilize the full spectrum of approaches — what is an approach closest to configuration which will still allow you to deliver on time?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReusability\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e If a pattern emerges that you can see applying across features, odds are someone else is looking for the same thing — configuration will benefit you here, and can cut down on duplication that is more likely in a customization approach.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eKey takeaways\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen evolving a design system, there is a range of strategies you can take. A more abstract configuration approach can increase consistency and maintainability, but at the risk of the system being a bottleneck for outgoing features. The less abstract customization approach enables quicker feature development; however, overall consistency of the product can suffer as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe more mature a product or feature is, the more beneficial and feasible a configuration approach is. However, the iterative and low-level nature of customization makes it more suitable for prototyping and features which are bespoke, or are still subject to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, one size does not fit all. In viewing the pros and cons of these different approaches, think of how those tradeoffs relate to your company’s broader values. At Spotify, the ability for teams to work autonomously is highly valued, and thus we generally lean more towards customization as a result.  Though we have the maturity to support a more configurable design system, that doesn’t mean we need to solve all of our challenges through configuration — it’s just another tool in the set that we can choose from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there is no right or wrong approach on how to best evolve your design system, I hope the measures above helped broaden your understanding of the tools available and the context surrounding them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA huge shout out to Krist Wongsuphasawat and his article \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/nightingale/navigating-the-wide-world-of-web-based-data-visualization-libraries-798ea9f536e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNavigating the Wide World of Data Visualization Libraries\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.

Developers are not tied to the system’s release cadence, which can be very appealing to teams who have pressing deadlines to meet. Not being tied to the constraints of a design system can also provide more freedom and flexibility, which can lead to more innovative approaches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCons: Lack of coherency, loss of maintainability, potential duplication\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA local override may solve the problem in a pinch, but those style overrides are less likely to be in close alignment with the system’s broader standards. What’s more, if this pattern emerges more broadly, this local code is not accessible for other feature developers to pick up and use — it would have to be duplicated. Further problems arise if we are looking at more sweeping updates to the design system — any sort of override (think padding, headings, spacing, even colors) made to a local version of the component will stay in place, even if the official version changes drastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eConfiguration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePros: Consistency, contribution, maintainability\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf emerging variations all find their way back to the parent component, then they can be reused and tracked, to ensure that consistency is maintained. If changes need to be made to the main component, folks using the system will need to contribute back to it to meet their needs. As components are updated, consumers may safely upgrade to the latest version with less concern of breaking local overrides in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCons: Can become a bottleneck, rigidness, vocabulary awareness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe other side of the contribution coin — relying on updates to the system means that code must be developed and released in a separate library before it can be used in features. This can slow down feature development, and it introduces a dependency, often on another team. The system also becomes more rigid when consumers are given fewer options — this is good for consistency, but can stifle innovation by setting constraints on how components can be manipulated. Understanding of the abstract vocabulary you have defined in configurations is an additional responsibility maintainers must take on, since you are no longer relying on baseline properties of CSS and HTML that are already thoroughly documented on the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to decide which approach to use\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith both ends of the abstraction spectrum carrying implications for the key functions of your design system, it should come as no surprise that you will end up with a mix of approaches. Here are some factors to consider in deciding what approach is best for your use case:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeature maturity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e If a feature is still taking shape, odds are the design is yet to be fully realized. This isn’t a bad thing — iteration is the name of the game. But when you are still experimenting with what the exact look will be, customization is your friend because you have access to any properties you may realize you need. On the flip side, if you are working with an established component, you have a wealth of existing use cases available to you to reference and establish patterns from, resulting in modifications with a more meaningful configuration for all to use.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduct maturity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e As with feature maturity, the less developed the product is, the harder it is to know what conventions will stick around. If you are seeing a pattern for the first time, customization may be the right move, but if you start to see it emerging in other aspects of the product, use that opportunity to take inventory of your variations and move into a more maintainable configuration approach.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTimeline\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e While design system engineers would rather look at the best-case scenario, the feature teams who consume design systems don’t often have the same luxury. Customization is going to get something out the door quicker, but this is a great opportunity to utilize the full spectrum of approaches — what is an approach closest to configuration which will still allow you to deliver on time?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReusability\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e If a pattern emerges that you can see applying across features, odds are someone else is looking for the same thing — configuration will benefit you here, and can cut down on duplication that is more likely in a customization approach.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eKey takeaways\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen evolving a design system, there is a range of strategies you can take. A more abstract configuration approach can increase consistency and maintainability, but at the risk of the system being a bottleneck for outgoing features. The less abstract customization approach enables quicker feature development; however, overall consistency of the product can suffer as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe more mature a product or feature is, the more beneficial and feasible a configuration approach is. However, the iterative and low-level nature of customization makes it more suitable for prototyping and features which are bespoke, or are still subject to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, one size does not fit all. In viewing the pros and cons of these different approaches, think of how those tradeoffs relate to your company’s broader values. At Spotify, the ability for teams to work autonomously is highly valued, and thus we generally lean more towards customization as a result.  Though we have the maturity to support a more configurable design system, that doesn’t mean we need to solve all of our challenges through configuration — it’s just another tool in the set that we can choose from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there is no right or wrong approach on how to best evolve your design system, I hope the measures above helped broaden your understanding of the tools available and the context surrounding them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA huge shout out to Krist Wongsuphasawat and his article \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/nightingale/navigating-the-wide-world-of-web-based-data-visualization-libraries-798ea9f536e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNavigating the Wide World of Data Visualization Libraries\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.

What’s more, if this pattern emerges more broadly, this local code is not accessible for other feature developers to pick up and use — it would have to be duplicated. Further problems arise if we are looking at more sweeping updates to the design system — any sort of override (think padding, headings, spacing, even colors) made to a local version of the component will stay in place, even if the official version changes drastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eConfiguration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePros: Consistency, contribution, maintainability\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf emerging variations all find their way back to the parent component, then they can be reused and tracked, to ensure that consistency is maintained. If changes need to be made to the main component, folks using the system will need to contribute back to it to meet their needs. As components are updated, consumers may safely upgrade to the latest version with less concern of breaking local overrides in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCons: Can become a bottleneck, rigidness, vocabulary awareness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe other side of the contribution coin — relying on updates to the system means that code must be developed and released in a separate library before it can be used in features. This can slow down feature development, and it introduces a dependency, often on another team. The system also becomes more rigid when consumers are given fewer options — this is good for consistency, but can stifle innovation by setting constraints on how components can be manipulated. Understanding of the abstract vocabulary you have defined in configurations is an additional responsibility maintainers must take on, since you are no longer relying on baseline properties of CSS and HTML that are already thoroughly documented on the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to decide which approach to use\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith both ends of the abstraction spectrum carrying implications for the key functions of your design system, it should come as no surprise that you will end up with a mix of approaches.

This isn’t a bad thing — iteration is the name of the game. But when you are still experimenting with what the exact look will be, customization is your friend because you have access to any properties you may realize you need. On the flip side, if you are working with an established component, you have a wealth of existing use cases available to you to reference and establish patterns from, resulting in modifications with a more meaningful configuration for all to use.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduct maturity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e As with feature maturity, the less developed the product is, the harder it is to know what conventions will stick around. If you are seeing a pattern for the first time, customization may be the right move, but if you start to see it emerging in other aspects of the product, use that opportunity to take inventory of your variations and move into a more maintainable configuration approach.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTimeline\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e While design system engineers would rather look at the best-case scenario, the feature teams who consume design systems don’t often have the same luxury. Customization is going to get something out the door quicker, but this is a great opportunity to utilize the full spectrum of approaches — what is an approach closest to configuration which will still allow you to deliver on time?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReusability\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e If a pattern emerges that you can see applying across features, odds are someone else is looking for the same thing — configuration will benefit you here, and can cut down on duplication that is more likely in a customization approach.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eKey takeaways\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen evolving a design system, there is a range of strategies you can take. A more abstract configuration approach can increase consistency and maintainability, but at the risk of the system being a bottleneck for outgoing features. The less abstract customization approach enables quicker feature development; however, overall consistency of the product can suffer as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe more mature a product or feature is, the more beneficial and feasible a configuration approach is. However, the iterative and low-level nature of customization makes it more suitable for prototyping and features which are bespoke, or are still subject to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, one size does not fit all. In viewing the pros and cons of these different approaches, think of how those tradeoffs relate to your company’s broader values. At Spotify, the ability for teams to work autonomously is highly valued, and thus we generally lean more towards customization as a result.  Though we have the maturity to support a more configurable design system, that doesn’t mean we need to solve all of our challenges through configuration — it’s just another tool in the set that we can choose from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there is no right or wrong approach on how to best evolve your design system, I hope the measures above helped broaden your understanding of the tools available and the context surrounding them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA huge shout out to Krist Wongsuphasawat and his article \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/nightingale/navigating-the-wide-world-of-web-based-data-visualization-libraries-798ea9f536e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNavigating the Wide World of Data Visualization Libraries\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.

In this context, we define it as a simplified version of a more complex concept. Abstraction can make some concepts easier by obscuring underlying characters of a system in favor of a more high-level representation. We are looking at abstraction here as a measure of how different the code we write is from the HTML and CSS that is ultimately rendered. For the scope of this piece, we will be discussing abstraction from the lens of frontend development using React, starting with written code through to what is rendered in the browser. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor a more thorough view of abstraction in software, and in life, check out \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@danieljyoo/levels-of-abstraction-a-key-concept-in-systems-design-7fdb33d288af\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eLevels of Abstraction, A Key Concept in Systems Design\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e by Daniel Jhin Yoo. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this context, a low level of abstraction would define something that touches CSS or HTML elements directly, whereas a high level of abstraction would define changing custom properties that have their own subjective meaning and value, that in turn modify some underlying CSS or elements within the component.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eCurrent landscape\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we understand what abstraction means in terms of defining web components, let’s take a look at some of the common approaches to handling evolving use cases.

Further problems arise if we are looking at more sweeping updates to the design system — any sort of override (think padding, headings, spacing, even colors) made to a local version of the component will stay in place, even if the official version changes drastically.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eConfiguration\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePros: Consistency, contribution, maintainability\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf emerging variations all find their way back to the parent component, then they can be reused and tracked, to ensure that consistency is maintained. If changes need to be made to the main component, folks using the system will need to contribute back to it to meet their needs. As components are updated, consumers may safely upgrade to the latest version with less concern of breaking local overrides in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCons: Can become a bottleneck, rigidness, vocabulary awareness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe other side of the contribution coin — relying on updates to the system means that code must be developed and released in a separate library before it can be used in features. This can slow down feature development, and it introduces a dependency, often on another team. The system also becomes more rigid when consumers are given fewer options — this is good for consistency, but can stifle innovation by setting constraints on how components can be manipulated. Understanding of the abstract vocabulary you have defined in configurations is an additional responsibility maintainers must take on, since you are no longer relying on baseline properties of CSS and HTML that are already thoroughly documented on the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to decide which approach to use\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith both ends of the abstraction spectrum carrying implications for the key functions of your design system, it should come as no surprise that you will end up with a mix of approaches. Here are some factors to consider in deciding what approach is best for your use case:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeature maturity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e If a feature is still taking shape, odds are the design is yet to be fully realized. This isn’t a bad thing — iteration is the name of the game. But when you are still experimenting with what the exact look will be, customization is your friend because you have access to any properties you may realize you need. On the flip side, if you are working with an established component, you have a wealth of existing use cases available to you to reference and establish patterns from, resulting in modifications with a more meaningful configuration for all to use.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduct maturity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e As with feature maturity, the less developed the product is, the harder it is to know what conventions will stick around. If you are seeing a pattern for the first time, customization may be the right move, but if you start to see it emerging in other aspects of the product, use that opportunity to take inventory of your variations and move into a more maintainable configuration approach.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTimeline\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e While design system engineers would rather look at the best-case scenario, the feature teams who consume design systems don’t often have the same luxury. Customization is going to get something out the door quicker, but this is a great opportunity to utilize the full spectrum of approaches — what is an approach closest to configuration which will still allow you to deliver on time?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReusability\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e:\u003c/strong\u003e If a pattern emerges that you can see applying across features, odds are someone else is looking for the same thing — configuration will benefit you here, and can cut down on duplication that is more likely in a customization approach.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eKey takeaways\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen evolving a design system, there is a range of strategies you can take. A more abstract configuration approach can increase consistency and maintainability, but at the risk of the system being a bottleneck for outgoing features. The less abstract customization approach enables quicker feature development; however, overall consistency of the product can suffer as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe more mature a product or feature is, the more beneficial and feasible a configuration approach is. However, the iterative and low-level nature of customization makes it more suitable for prototyping and features which are bespoke, or are still subject to change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLastly, one size does not fit all. In viewing the pros and cons of these different approaches, think of how those tradeoffs relate to your company’s broader values. At Spotify, the ability for teams to work autonomously is highly valued, and thus we generally lean more towards customization as a result.  Though we have the maturity to support a more configurable design system, that doesn’t mean we need to solve all of our challenges through configuration — it’s just another tool in the set that we can choose from.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile there is no right or wrong approach on how to best evolve your design system, I hope the measures above helped broaden your understanding of the tools available and the context surrounding them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e—\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eA huge shout out to Krist Wongsuphasawat and his article \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/nightingale/navigating-the-wide-world-of-web-based-data-visualization-libraries-798ea9f536e7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eNavigating the Wide World of Data Visualization Libraries\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.

When users come to any kind of search, they already have something in mind, whether they come looking for one thing in particular or are open to becoming inspired. Spotify Search is no exception, helping a vast majority of users find joy through search, regardless of the language or method used to search, both typed and spoken.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince Spotify’s launch in 2008, Search has been a core piece of the user journey, and it’s where we’ve increased our investment and focus over time. Earlier on, only a small group of people were responsible for the end-to-end experience that encompassed the infrastructure that held Search together, the backend system that powered the personalized results, and the desktop and mobile interface that delighted our users. Spotify continued to grow, reaching 345 million users in December 2020, and Search grew with it. This post details the challenges that emerged as teams began to scale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhen more doesn’t mean more\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the beginning of 2019, we already had a handful of teams working across the Search infrastructure, as well as the machine learning and backend systems. Given the increasing number of user issues we were trying to solve at the time, we decided to organize ourselves around these problems. But we quickly learned that problems come and go, new problems arise, and priorities can change unexpectedly. This meant that we were creating new teams all the time (well, not all the time, but almost every quarter).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image5-700x352.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image5-700x352.jpg 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image5-250x126.jpg 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image5-768x386.jpg 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image5-1536x772.jpg 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image5-120x60.jpg 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image5.jpg 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e2020 was the year for us to try something new. We decided to take a different approach to organizing our teams. Each team would become responsible for one piece of our Search stack — meaning one team would be responsible for getting data into Search, another team would be responsible for the quality of personalized Search results, another team would be responsible for our Search APIs, another team for insights, and finally, a team would be focused on our company bet, podcast Search. You might be wondering, “\u003cem\u003eIf each team were responsible for one part of the Search stack, how would we solve problems that required the expertise of different parts of our time around specific issues such as query intent, retrieval, and ranking?”\u003c/em\u003e That is a great question — one that was highlighted as one of the original risks when we formed this  organization. But we believed that nurturing our tech stack was the way to go. And guess what? We learned new things, which made us reconsider old ways of thinking. Or better, made us want to try something different.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image2-700x352.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image2-700x352.jpg 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image2-250x126.jpg 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image2-768x386.jpg 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image2-1536x772.jpg 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image2-120x60.jpg 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image2.jpg 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy the end of 2020, we had grown our internal efforts by more than 100% compared to 2018, and 500% compared to 2016. But we were not seeing the same boom in terms of speed of delivery, experimentation, and number of problems we were solving. Each time a team outside our Search area wanted to collaborate with us or use our systems to solve their problems, they would need to involve multiple experts from each Search stack part, meaning sometimes five different Search teams. There were also varied rhythms and maturities among teams and systems, despite having the same priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe were experiencing these problems on a daily basis, but we weren’t sure if we were blindsided by our previous learnings and our own beliefs or if we were biased because of the people we asked for feedback. We decided to check some numbers. Supported by Spotify’s Chief Architect Niklas Gustavsson’s latest research, we focused on two data points: system centrality and system congestion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2101\" height=\"879\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15.jpg 2101w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-250x105.jpg 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-700x293.jpg 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-768x321.jpg 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-1536x643.jpg 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-2048x857.jpg 2048w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-120x50.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2101px) 100vw, 2101px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the image above, congestion represents the unique teams contributing to the codebase over a period of time. Centrality is subdivided into two buckets: indegree centrality — how many teams have a dependency on a given service; and outdegree centrality — how many teams the service depends on. Search was in high demand across all these dimensions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSearch as a platform\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGreat — we received feedback from users, from other teams, from our own Search teams, and we also had data from our own systems. Was there something else we could use to have a better understanding and make a more informed decision on how to make our Search better? We knew that users from different markets were experiencing different levels of Search satisfaction, and that the forecast was that new-user growth would come from outside North America and Western Europe. We also knew that we had dedicated Spotify teams focused on improving the overall experience for these new markets. Spotify had, as well, much experience building internal tools and platforms to scale our business and improve productivity. So we wondered, should we build a Search platform? We believed so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFrom user obsession to developer satisfaction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith insights about Spotify’s growth, system centrality and system congestion, along with team and user feedback, we decided, in 2021, to evolve our organization to try to solve for the needs of both external (Spotify end users) and internal (Spotify developers) users. In order to accomplish that, we created two groups inside our Search area —  one focused on our personalized core Search experience, with Spotify end user satisfaction as the measure of success, and the other aiming to improve Spotify developer happiness, encouraging experimentation while maintaining the services SLOs. Below you can see what our Search organization looks like today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-700x352.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-700x352.jpg 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-250x126.jpg 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-768x386.jpg 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-1536x772.jpg 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-120x60.jpg 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3.jpg 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile these two groups don’t necessarily share the same metrics, we believe that they do share the same goal: “\u003cem\u003e[T]o unlock the potential of human creativity — by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it.\u003c/em\u003e” Making these groups autonomous and independent in ways of working and goal setting — leading with context instead of control — is what we believe makes us better prepared to support Spotify users and growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKatarina Berg, Chief HR Officer, says “\u003cem\u003eGrowth is our mantra\u003c/em\u003e” and “\u003cem\u003eChange is our constant.”\u003c/em\u003e This means that our Search journey will not end here.

Given the increasing number of user issues we were trying to solve at the time, we decided to organize ourselves around these problems. But we quickly learned that problems come and go, new problems arise, and priorities can change unexpectedly.

We decided to take a different approach to organizing our teams. Each team would become responsible for one piece of our Search stack — meaning one team would be responsible for getting data into Search, another team would be responsible for the quality of personalized Search results, another team would be responsible for our Search APIs, another team for insights, and finally, a team would be focused on our company bet, podcast Search.

But we were not seeing the same boom in terms of speed of delivery, experimentation, and number of problems we were solving. Each time a team outside our Search area wanted to collaborate with us or use our systems to solve their problems, they would need to involve multiple experts from each Search stack part, meaning sometimes five different Search teams. There were also varied rhythms and maturities among teams and systems, despite having the same priorities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe were experiencing these problems on a daily basis, but we weren’t sure if we were blindsided by our previous learnings and our own beliefs or if we were biased because of the people we asked for feedback. We decided to check some numbers. Supported by Spotify’s Chief Architect Niklas Gustavsson’s latest research, we focused on two data points: system centrality and system congestion. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2101\" height=\"879\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15.jpg 2101w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-250x105.jpg 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-700x293.jpg 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-768x321.jpg 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-1536x643.jpg 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-2048x857.jpg 2048w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/Frame-15-120x50.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2101px) 100vw, 2101px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the image above, congestion represents the unique teams contributing to the codebase over a period of time. Centrality is subdivided into two buckets: indegree centrality — how many teams have a dependency on a given service; and outdegree centrality — how many teams the service depends on. Search was in high demand across all these dimensions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSearch as a platform\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eGreat — we received feedback from users, from other teams, from our own Search teams, and we also had data from our own systems. Was there something else we could use to have a better understanding and make a more informed decision on how to make our Search better? We knew that users from different markets were experiencing different levels of Search satisfaction, and that the forecast was that new-user growth would come from outside North America and Western Europe. We also knew that we had dedicated Spotify teams focused on improving the overall experience for these new markets. Spotify had, as well, much experience building internal tools and platforms to scale our business and improve productivity. So we wondered, should we build a Search platform? We believed so.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFrom user obsession to developer satisfaction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith insights about Spotify’s growth, system centrality and system congestion, along with team and user feedback, we decided, in 2021, to evolve our organization to try to solve for the needs of both external (Spotify end users) and internal (Spotify developers) users. In order to accomplish that, we created two groups inside our Search area —  one focused on our personalized core Search experience, with Spotify end user satisfaction as the measure of success, and the other aiming to improve Spotify developer happiness, encouraging experimentation while maintaining the services SLOs. Below you can see what our Search organization looks like today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-700x352.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-700x352.jpg 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-250x126.jpg 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-768x386.jpg 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-1536x772.jpg 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3-120x60.jpg 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3.jpg 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile these two groups don’t necessarily share the same metrics, we believe that they do share the same goal: “\u003cem\u003e[T]o unlock the potential of human creativity — by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by it.\u003c/em\u003e” Making these groups autonomous and independent in ways of working and goal setting — leading with context instead of control — is what we believe makes us better prepared to support Spotify users and growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKatarina Berg, Chief HR Officer, says “\u003cem\u003eGrowth is our mantra\u003c/em\u003e” and “\u003cem\u003eChange is our constant.”\u003c/em\u003e This means that our Search journey will not end here.

Earlier on, only a small group of people were responsible for the end-to-end experience that encompassed the infrastructure that held Search together, the backend system that powered the personalized results, and the desktop and mobile interface that delighted our users. Spotify continued to grow, reaching 345 million users in December 2020, and Search grew with it.

Given the increasing number of user issues we were trying to solve at the time, we decided to organize ourselves around these problems. But we quickly learned that problems come and go, new problems arise, and priorities can change unexpectedly. This meant that we were creating new teams all the time (well, not all the time, but almost every quarter).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"352\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image5-700x352.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image5-700x352.jpg 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image5-250x126.jpg 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image5-768x386.jpg 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image5-1536x772.jpg 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image5-120x60.jpg 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image5.jpg 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e2020 was the year for us to try something new.

The Desktop was our rich, full-featured experience and the Web Player was a much lighter, simpler experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause the Web Player was implemented with a modern React app architecture, we had success onboarding new engineers to the Web Player code. But those same engineers were having difficulties with the Desktop client, which used a very diverse range of web technologies (thanks to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eConway’s law\u003c/a\u003e). Due to having to implement many of the features twice at different levels of complexity while dealing with context switching, we were not shipping new features at the pace we would have liked to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, there were accessibility issues in our clients that we needed to solve. We discovered that making our Web Player accessible was going to be a difficult, yet achievable, challenge. Making the Desktop application accessible, in contrast, would be nearly impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe had many discussions on how to solve these problems. The team figured out that converging the clients into a single codebase and user experience would be the best way forward. We considered several approaches and did tech spikes to test many of the ideas — component sharing, feature sharing — always trying to find the right balance between fixing our technical debt problem while continuing to improve the experience for our users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe knew we were embarking on a long-term project, so our biggest priority was to de-risk delivery and avoid trapping ourselves into a big bang rewrite. We settled on a bold solution: focus on iterating on top of the existing Web Player codebase until it reached a Desktop-grade feature set. Since our Web Player is continuously deployed, we could ship and test with real users every change made towards our final goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere were risks, of course. Desktop had (and has) many more users than Web Player, and Spotify’s Desktop client is the place most of Spotify’s “power users” call home. We knew we would have a lot of work to do to bring our Web Player up to those power users’ exacting standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, at the beginning of 2021, we have created one maintainable codebase for both of our clients with the high standard of accessibility and speed of development we hoped for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s talk more in detail about how we turned the idea into reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image8-700x259.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image8-700x259.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image8-250x93.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image8-768x285.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image8-1536x569.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image8-120x44.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image8.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOne UI, multiple containers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spotify Desktop client is a Windows and Mac native application that uses CEF (\u003ca href=\"https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eChromium Embedded Framework\u003c/a\u003e) to display a web-based user interface. That’s still true today, but for the previous version of Desktop, every “page” in the client was built as a standalone “app” to run inside its own iframe. This architecture was designed to foster autonomy, allowing multiple teams — and potentially partners — to own the development and maintenance of the features. Eventually, however, one team became responsible for the user interface of the entire application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image7-700x701.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image7-700x701.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image7-250x250.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image7-150x150.png 150w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image7-768x769.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image7-120x120.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image7.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePrevious architecture (simplified) of the Desktop client.

The UI would access the backend through the native container.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe previous version of the Desktop client had many strengths, including Spotify’s original “killer feature” from its very first client, which would allow \u003ca href=\"http://www.csc.kth.se/~gkreitz/spotify-p2p10/spotify-p2p10.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eplayback to begin as soon as a listener clicked\u003c/a\u003e. It also boasted a comprehensive set of features we know Spotify listeners value. But, at the same time, this architecture was causing severe friction for developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Web Player’s codebase, however, was considered a much more solid foundation to build upon. It allowed us to develop new features quickly. It was developed with the web in mind, meaning it was small in size, more performant, and worked with various browsers. The client was delivered continuously, allowing changes to get to users almost immediately. We decided, then, to use the Web Player as the starting point for a single user experience shared between the Web Player and Desktop. One of the main challenges we encountered was that this approach would require us to ship and run the Web Player UI with the Desktop container.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Web Player was also tightly coupled to our web servers, relying on them for all data and authentication. The playback system used by Web Player was not compatible with Desktop. Authentication worked differently — we needed to support our web OAuth login on Web Player and our native login on Desktop. Desktop would also need features its users expect, such as downloading and offline playback, that are not supported by the Web Player.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis concept of running the same user interface on two similar but different infrastructures is what informed the architecture we developed. In order to keep the UI platform agnostic, we built TypeScript Platform APIs that would abstract the different sources of data and different playback stacks, as well as provide helpful information to the user interface about what functionality was available to it. We also rewrote the whole client in TypeScript along the way, as we were rebuilding the experience bit by bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile work was done outside of our team to make certain kinds of data available via the web, we focused on decoupling the Web Player not just from the web servers but also from any hard-coded dependencies from being run in a normal browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe final architecture looks like a layer of Platform APIs that expose the underlying Spotify ecosystem to clients, with a React-based user interface and the Platform APIs exposed via React Hooks. Thus, the new UI can run on the web, and it can run in our Desktop container, and never know, or care, if the data is coming from our C++ stack or our web infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/path879-700x375.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/path879-700x375.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/path879-250x134.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/path879-768x412.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/path879-120x64.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/path879.png 1199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe new architecture of Web Player (left) and Desktop (right) clients.

We added downloading, offline mode, local files, lyrics, a “Now Playing” queue, as well as advanced features such as sorting and filtering of playlists and albums.

What features in the existing Desktop application \u003cem\u003ehad\u003c/em\u003e to be implemented in the new one? What should the new client look like? Almost immediately the design and product insight teams began to investigate how our users use our software, so that we could draw up a road map towards being able to ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time we created a small “virtual team” made up of engineers from several teams to begin the very first engineering experiments and answer some fundamental questions: Was the desired solution even possible? How much work would it actually require? This virtual team’s priority was simply to get the Web Player, as it was, running inside the Desktop container. They would solve the problem of playback and authentication, explore how the UI was bundled with the container, and set the engineering blueprint for the rest of the project. The team was aided by other teams within Spotify to create a single UI that could run on multiple platforms having different capabilities — for example, televisions. The fact that both codebases were co-located in the same monorepo as a result of previous efforts to converge the clients was key to facilitating this task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter three months, the team’s work concluded successfully. We established our roadmap and priorities, and we knew exactly what we would be doing for the upcoming year. It would require a full commitment from everyone on our wider team, with constant testing and analysis to ensure we were on the correct path. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn reality, this project only happened because of the commitment of our engineering, design, and product management teams to envision a product that engineers could iterate on quickly, and that would fully support the Spotify vision. We had to iterate longer than we’d hoped before shipping to users, but the speed at which the team was able to implement these features in the new shared UI is what gave everyone the confidence that we were heading in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eEvaluating success\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe had four primary goals at the start of this project: make our code reusable, unify our user experience and visual design, improve speed to deliver more quickly, and do all of this while meeting Desktop and Web Player users’ needs. With the results of the project now shipped, how have we performed against these metrics?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image3.png 1999w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image3-250x250.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image3-700x700.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image3-150x150.png 150w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image3-768x768.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image3-1536x1536.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/04/image3-120x120.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eReusability\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eReusing the same code in multiple clients (i.e., the Web Player and Desktop) allows us to write the code once and reap the benefits in multiple places. When we need to implement a design change, it’s much more efficient to make it in one location and have it propagate to all receiving endpoints. We would like to expand our reusability in the future, sharing more of our Platform APIs with even more clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eUnification\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUser experience and visual design are important yet time-consuming areas to improve within an application. Thus, having one set of components that service multiple clients ensures that we can implement designs more thoroughly, thereby improving our users’ experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCritically, we have been able to achieve a degree of unification with the rest of the Spotify ecosystem, moving our clients to Spotify’s shared design language. The result is a more consistent experience when users switch between mobile and desktop, as well as a more modern, contemporary, accessible, and user-oriented experience for everyone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eSpeed\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn important justification for this project was the argument that a modernized codebase with a single, easy-to-understand architecture would increase our velocity as engineers. While we need more time to conclusively prove success in the long term, the large number of features the team has already completed since the project began is a positive indicator. Speed, however, is merely an outcome — the result of engineers with clear goals working with a healthy codebase. We measure code health in terms of test coverage, maintainability, readability, and how easy code is to remove. The architecture we chose had unexpected benefits in terms of making UI coding simpler and easier to understand as developers, and so we are hopeful this platform is going to be a solid foundation for us to build on in the years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e4. \u003cstrong\u003eSatisfaction: Meeting Desktop and Web Player user needs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new experience has been developed with Spotify users in mind — both existing Desktop power users, and new users coming from the mobile app or completely new to the Spotify ecosystem. From the very beginning, we’ve been evaluating and testing our progress at each step to make sure we deliver an experience that fulfills our users’ needs.

The Desktop was our rich, full-featured experience and the Web Player was a much lighter, simpler experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause the Web Player was implemented with a modern React app architecture, we had success onboarding new engineers to the Web Player code. But those same engineers were having difficulties with the Desktop client, which used a very diverse range of web technologies (thanks to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eConway’s law\u003c/a\u003e). Due to having to implement many of the features twice at different levels of complexity while dealing with context switching, we were not shipping new features at the pace we would have liked to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, there were accessibility issues in our clients that we needed to solve. We discovered that making our Web Player accessible was going to be a difficult, yet achievable, challenge. Making the Desktop application accessible, in contrast, would be nearly impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe had many discussions on how to solve these problems. The team figured out that converging the clients into a single codebase and user experience would be the best way forward. We considered several approaches and did tech spikes to test many of the ideas — component sharing, feature sharing — always trying to find the right balance between fixing our technical debt problem while continuing to improve the experience for our users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe knew we were embarking on a long-term project, so our biggest priority was to de-risk delivery and avoid trapping ourselves into a big bang rewrite. We settled on a bold solution: focus on iterating on top of the existing Web Player codebase until it reached a Desktop-grade feature set. Since our Web Player is continuously deployed, we could ship and test with real users every change made towards our final goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere were risks, of course. Desktop had (and has) many more users than Web Player, and Spotify’s Desktop client is the place most of Spotify’s “power users” call home. We knew we would have a lot of work to do to bring our Web Player up to those power users’ exacting standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, at the beginning of 2021, we have created one maintainable codebase for both of our clients with the high standard of accessibility and speed of development we hoped for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s talk more in detail about how we turned the idea into reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-700x259.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-700x259.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-250x93.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-768x285.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-1536x569.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-120x44.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOne UI, multiple containers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spotify Desktop client is a Windows and Mac native application that uses CEF (\u003ca href=\"https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eChromium Embedded Framework\u003c/a\u003e) to display a web-based user interface. That’s still true today, but for the previous version of Desktop, every “page” in the client was built as a standalone “app” to run inside its own iframe. This architecture was designed to foster autonomy, allowing multiple teams — and potentially partners — to own the development and maintenance of the features. Eventually, however, one team became responsible for the user interface of the entire application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-700x701.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-700x701.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-250x250.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-150x150.png 150w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-768x769.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-120x120.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePrevious architecture (simplified) of the Desktop client.

It also boasted a comprehensive set of features we know Spotify listeners value. But, at the same time, this architecture was causing severe friction for developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Web Player’s codebase, however, was considered a much more solid foundation to build upon. It allowed us to develop new features quickly. It was developed with the web in mind, meaning it was small in size, more performant, and worked with various browsers. The client was delivered continuously, allowing changes to get to users almost immediately. We decided, then, to use the Web Player as the starting point for a single user experience shared between the Web Player and Desktop. One of the main challenges we encountered was that this approach would require us to ship and run the Web Player UI with the Desktop container.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Web Player was also tightly coupled to our web servers, relying on them for all data and authentication. The playback system used by Web Player was not compatible with Desktop. Authentication worked differently — we needed to support our web OAuth login on Web Player and our native login on Desktop. Desktop would also need features its users expect, such as downloading and offline playback, that are not supported by the Web Player.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis concept of running the same user interface on two similar but different infrastructures is what informed the architecture we developed. In order to keep the UI platform agnostic, we built TypeScript Platform APIs that would abstract the different sources of data and different playback stacks, as well as provide helpful information to the user interface about what functionality was available to it. We also rewrote the whole client in TypeScript along the way, as we were rebuilding the experience bit by bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile work was done outside of our team to make certain kinds of data available via the web, we focused on decoupling the Web Player not just from the web servers but also from any hard-coded dependencies from being run in a normal browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe final architecture looks like a layer of Platform APIs that expose the underlying Spotify ecosystem to clients, with a React-based user interface and the Platform APIs exposed via React Hooks. Thus, the new UI can run on the web, and it can run in our Desktop container, and never know, or care, if the data is coming from our C++ stack or our web infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-700x375.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-700x375.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-250x134.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-768x412.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-120x64.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879.png 1199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe new architecture of Web Player (left) and Desktop (right) clients.

What features in the existing Desktop application \u003cem\u003ehad\u003c/em\u003e to be implemented in the new one? What should the new client look like? Almost immediately the design and product insight teams began to investigate how our users use our software, so that we could draw up a road map towards being able to ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time we created a small “virtual team” made up of engineers from several teams to begin the very first engineering experiments and answer some fundamental questions: Was the desired solution even possible? How much work would it actually require? This virtual team’s priority was simply to get the Web Player, as it was, running inside the Desktop container. They would solve the problem of playback and authentication, explore how the UI was bundled with the container, and set the engineering blueprint for the rest of the project. The team was aided by other teams within Spotify to create a single UI that could run on multiple platforms having different capabilities — for example, televisions. The fact that both codebases were co-located in the same monorepo as a result of previous efforts to converge the clients was key to facilitating this task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter three months, the team’s work concluded successfully. We established our roadmap and priorities, and we knew exactly what we would be doing for the upcoming year. It would require a full commitment from everyone on our wider team, with constant testing and analysis to ensure we were on the correct path. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn reality, this project only happened because of the commitment of our engineering, design, and product management teams to envision a product that engineers could iterate on quickly, and that would fully support the Spotify vision. We had to iterate longer than we’d hoped before shipping to users, but the speed at which the team was able to implement these features in the new shared UI is what gave everyone the confidence that we were heading in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eEvaluating success\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe had four primary goals at the start of this project: make our code reusable, unify our user experience and visual design, improve speed to deliver more quickly, and do all of this while meeting Desktop and Web Player users’ needs. With the results of the project now shipped, how have we performed against these metrics?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eReusability\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eReusing the same code in multiple clients (i.e., the Web Player and Desktop) allows us to write the code once and reap the benefits in multiple places. When we need to implement a design change, it’s much more efficient to make it in one location and have it propagate to all receiving endpoints. We would like to expand our reusability in the future, sharing more of our Platform APIs with even more clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eUnification\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUser experience and visual design are important yet time-consuming areas to improve within an application. Thus, having one set of components that service multiple clients ensures that we can implement designs more thoroughly, thereby improving our users’ experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCritically, we have been able to achieve a degree of unification with the rest of the Spotify ecosystem, moving our clients to Spotify’s shared design language. The result is a more consistent experience when users switch between mobile and desktop, as well as a more modern, contemporary, accessible, and user-oriented experience for everyone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eSpeed\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn important justification for this project was the argument that a modernized codebase with a single, easy-to-understand architecture would increase our velocity as engineers. While we need more time to conclusively prove success in the long term, the large number of features the team has already completed since the project began is a positive indicator. Speed, however, is merely an outcome — the result of engineers with clear goals working with a healthy codebase. We measure code health in terms of test coverage, maintainability, readability, and how easy code is to remove. The architecture we chose had unexpected benefits in terms of making UI coding simpler and easier to understand as developers, and so we are hopeful this platform is going to be a solid foundation for us to build on in the years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e4. \u003cstrong\u003eSatisfaction: Meeting Desktop and Web Player user needs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new experience has been developed with Spotify users in mind — both existing Desktop power users, and new users coming from the mobile app or completely new to the Spotify ecosystem. From the very beginning, we’ve been evaluating and testing our progress at each step to make sure we deliver an experience that fulfills our users’ needs. We’ve conducted extensive user research and run continuous tests over the past year that have informed us of the direction we should take. We’ve made the experience more accessible than ever, so everyone can enjoy using the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are looking closely at the feedback received and are continuously shaping the application to satisfy users’ needs.

The Desktop was our rich, full-featured experience and the Web Player was a much lighter, simpler experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause the Web Player was implemented with a modern React app architecture, we had success onboarding new engineers to the Web Player code. But those same engineers were having difficulties with the Desktop client, which used a very diverse range of web technologies (thanks to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eConway’s law\u003c/a\u003e). Due to having to implement many of the features twice at different levels of complexity while dealing with context switching, we were not shipping new features at the pace we would have liked to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, there were accessibility issues in our clients that we needed to solve. We discovered that making our Web Player accessible was going to be a difficult, yet achievable, challenge. Making the Desktop application accessible, in contrast, would be nearly impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe had many discussions on how to solve these problems. The team figured out that converging the clients into a single codebase and user experience would be the best way forward. We considered several approaches and did tech spikes to test many of the ideas — component sharing, feature sharing — always trying to find the right balance between fixing our technical debt problem while continuing to improve the experience for our users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe knew we were embarking on a long-term project, so our biggest priority was to de-risk delivery and avoid trapping ourselves into a big bang rewrite. We settled on a bold solution: focus on iterating on top of the existing Web Player codebase until it reached a Desktop-grade feature set. Since our Web Player is continuously deployed, we could ship and test with real users every change made towards our final goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere were risks, of course. Desktop had (and has) many more users than Web Player, and Spotify’s Desktop client is the place most of Spotify’s “power users” call home. We knew we would have a lot of work to do to bring our Web Player up to those power users’ exacting standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, at the beginning of 2021, we have created one maintainable codebase for both of our clients with the high standard of accessibility and speed of development we hoped for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s talk more in detail about how we turned the idea into reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-700x259.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-700x259.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-250x93.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-768x285.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-1536x569.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-120x44.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOne UI, multiple containers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spotify Desktop client is a Windows and Mac native application that uses CEF (\u003ca href=\"https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eChromium Embedded Framework\u003c/a\u003e) to display a web-based user interface. That’s still true today, but for the previous version of Desktop, every “page” in the client was built as a standalone “app” to run inside its own iframe. This architecture was designed to foster autonomy, allowing multiple teams — and potentially partners — to own the development and maintenance of the features. Eventually, however, one team became responsible for the user interface of the entire application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-700x701.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-700x701.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-250x250.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-150x150.png 150w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-768x769.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-120x120.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePrevious architecture (simplified) of the Desktop client.

It also boasted a comprehensive set of features we know Spotify listeners value. But, at the same time, this architecture was causing severe friction for developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Web Player’s codebase, however, was considered a much more solid foundation to build upon. It allowed us to develop new features quickly. It was developed with the web in mind, meaning it was small in size, more performant, and worked with various browsers. The client was delivered continuously, allowing changes to get to users almost immediately. We decided, then, to use the Web Player as the starting point for a single user experience shared between the Web Player and Desktop. One of the main challenges we encountered was that this approach would require us to ship and run the Web Player UI with the Desktop container.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Web Player was also tightly coupled to our web servers, relying on them for all data and authentication. The playback system used by Web Player was not compatible with Desktop. Authentication worked differently — we needed to support our web OAuth login on Web Player and our native login on Desktop. Desktop would also need features its users expect, such as downloading and offline playback, that are not supported by the Web Player.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis concept of running the same user interface on two similar but different infrastructures is what informed the architecture we developed. In order to keep the UI platform agnostic, we built TypeScript Platform APIs that would abstract the different sources of data and different playback stacks, as well as provide helpful information to the user interface about what functionality was available to it. We also rewrote the whole client in TypeScript along the way, as we were rebuilding the experience bit by bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile work was done outside of our team to make certain kinds of data available via the web, we focused on decoupling the Web Player not just from the web servers but also from any hard-coded dependencies from being run in a normal browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe final architecture looks like a layer of Platform APIs that expose the underlying Spotify ecosystem to clients, with a React-based user interface and the Platform APIs exposed via React Hooks. Thus, the new UI can run on the web, and it can run in our Desktop container, and never know, or care, if the data is coming from our C++ stack or our web infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-700x375.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-700x375.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-250x134.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-768x412.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-120x64.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879.png 1199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe new architecture of Web Player (left) and Desktop (right) clients.

What features in the existing Desktop application \u003cem\u003ehad\u003c/em\u003e to be implemented in the new one? What should the new client look like? Almost immediately the design and product insight teams began to investigate how our users use our software, so that we could draw up a road map towards being able to ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time we created a small “virtual team” made up of engineers from several teams to begin the very first engineering experiments and answer some fundamental questions: Was the desired solution even possible? How much work would it actually require? This virtual team’s priority was simply to get the Web Player, as it was, running inside the Desktop container. They would solve the problem of playback and authentication, explore how the UI was bundled with the container, and set the engineering blueprint for the rest of the project. The team was aided by other teams within Spotify to create a single UI that could run on multiple platforms having different capabilities — for example, televisions. The fact that both codebases were co-located in the same monorepo as a result of previous efforts to converge the clients was key to facilitating this task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter three months, the team’s work concluded successfully. We established our roadmap and priorities, and we knew exactly what we would be doing for the upcoming year. It would require a full commitment from everyone on our wider team, with constant testing and analysis to ensure we were on the correct path. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn reality, this project only happened because of the commitment of our engineering, design, and product management teams to envision a product that engineers could iterate on quickly, and that would fully support the Spotify vision. We had to iterate longer than we’d hoped before shipping to users, but the speed at which the team was able to implement these features in the new shared UI is what gave everyone the confidence that we were heading in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eEvaluating success\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe had four primary goals at the start of this project: make our code reusable, unify our user experience and visual design, improve speed to deliver more quickly, and do all of this while meeting Desktop and Web Player users’ needs. With the results of the project now shipped, how have we performed against these metrics?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eReusability\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eReusing the same code in multiple clients (i.e., the Web Player and Desktop) allows us to write the code once and reap the benefits in multiple places. When we need to implement a design change, it’s much more efficient to make it in one location and have it propagate to all receiving endpoints. We would like to expand our reusability in the future, sharing more of our Platform APIs with even more clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eUnification\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUser experience and visual design are important yet time-consuming areas to improve within an application. Thus, having one set of components that service multiple clients ensures that we can implement designs more thoroughly, thereby improving our users’ experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCritically, we have been able to achieve a degree of unification with the rest of the Spotify ecosystem, moving our clients to Spotify’s shared design language. The result is a more consistent experience when users switch between mobile and desktop, as well as a more modern, contemporary, accessible, and user-oriented experience for everyone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eSpeed\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn important justification for this project was the argument that a modernized codebase with a single, easy-to-understand architecture would increase our velocity as engineers. While we need more time to conclusively prove success in the long term, the large number of features the team has already completed since the project began is a positive indicator. Speed, however, is merely an outcome — the result of engineers with clear goals working with a healthy codebase. We measure code health in terms of test coverage, maintainability, readability, and how easy code is to remove. The architecture we chose had unexpected benefits in terms of making UI coding simpler and easier to understand as developers, and so we are hopeful this platform is going to be a solid foundation for us to build on in the years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e4. \u003cstrong\u003eSatisfaction: Meeting Desktop and Web Player user needs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new experience has been developed with Spotify users in mind — both existing Desktop power users, and new users coming from the mobile app or completely new to the Spotify ecosystem. From the very beginning, we’ve been evaluating and testing our progress at each step to make sure we deliver an experience that fulfills our users’ needs. We’ve conducted extensive user research and run continuous tests over the past year that have informed us of the direction we should take. We’ve made the experience more accessible than ever, so everyone can enjoy using the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are looking closely at the feedback received and are continuously shaping the application to satisfy users’ needs.

The Desktop was our rich, full-featured experience and the Web Player was a much lighter, simpler experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause the Web Player was implemented with a modern React app architecture, we had success onboarding new engineers to the Web Player code. But those same engineers were having difficulties with the Desktop client, which used a very diverse range of web technologies (thanks to \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eConway’s law\u003c/a\u003e). Due to having to implement many of the features twice at different levels of complexity while dealing with context switching, we were not shipping new features at the pace we would have liked to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, there were accessibility issues in our clients that we needed to solve. We discovered that making our Web Player accessible was going to be a difficult, yet achievable, challenge. Making the Desktop application accessible, in contrast, would be nearly impossible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe had many discussions on how to solve these problems. The team figured out that converging the clients into a single codebase and user experience would be the best way forward. We considered several approaches and did tech spikes to test many of the ideas — component sharing, feature sharing — always trying to find the right balance between fixing our technical debt problem while continuing to improve the experience for our users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe knew we were embarking on a long-term project, so our biggest priority was to de-risk delivery and avoid trapping ourselves into a big bang rewrite. We settled on a bold solution: focus on iterating on top of the existing Web Player codebase until it reached a Desktop-grade feature set. Since our Web Player is continuously deployed, we could ship and test with real users every change made towards our final goal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere were risks, of course. Desktop had (and has) many more users than Web Player, and Spotify’s Desktop client is the place most of Spotify’s “power users” call home. We knew we would have a lot of work to do to bring our Web Player up to those power users’ exacting standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, at the beginning of 2021, we have created one maintainable codebase for both of our clients with the high standard of accessibility and speed of development we hoped for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s talk more in detail about how we turned the idea into reality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-700x259.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-700x259.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-250x93.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-768x285.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-1536x569.png 1536w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8-120x44.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image8.png 1999w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOne UI, multiple containers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Spotify Desktop client is a Windows and Mac native application that uses CEF (\u003ca href=\"https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eChromium Embedded Framework\u003c/a\u003e) to display a web-based user interface. That’s still true today, but for the previous version of Desktop, every “page” in the client was built as a standalone “app” to run inside its own iframe. This architecture was designed to foster autonomy, allowing multiple teams — and potentially partners — to own the development and maintenance of the features. Eventually, however, one team became responsible for the user interface of the entire application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-700x701.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"451\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-700x701.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-250x250.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-150x150.png 150w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-768x769.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7-120x120.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image7.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePrevious architecture (simplified) of the Desktop client.

It allowed us to develop new features quickly. It was developed with the web in mind, meaning it was small in size, more performant, and worked with various browsers. The client was delivered continuously, allowing changes to get to users almost immediately. We decided, then, to use the Web Player as the starting point for a single user experience shared between the Web Player and Desktop. One of the main challenges we encountered was that this approach would require us to ship and run the Web Player UI with the Desktop container.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Web Player was also tightly coupled to our web servers, relying on them for all data and authentication. The playback system used by Web Player was not compatible with Desktop. Authentication worked differently — we needed to support our web OAuth login on Web Player and our native login on Desktop. Desktop would also need features its users expect, such as downloading and offline playback, that are not supported by the Web Player.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis concept of running the same user interface on two similar but different infrastructures is what informed the architecture we developed. In order to keep the UI platform agnostic, we built TypeScript Platform APIs that would abstract the different sources of data and different playback stacks, as well as provide helpful information to the user interface about what functionality was available to it. We also rewrote the whole client in TypeScript along the way, as we were rebuilding the experience bit by bit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile work was done outside of our team to make certain kinds of data available via the web, we focused on decoupling the Web Player not just from the web servers but also from any hard-coded dependencies from being run in a normal browser.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe final architecture looks like a layer of Platform APIs that expose the underlying Spotify ecosystem to clients, with a React-based user interface and the Platform APIs exposed via React Hooks. Thus, the new UI can run on the web, and it can run in our Desktop container, and never know, or care, if the data is coming from our C++ stack or our web infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"375\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-700x375.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-700x375.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-250x134.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-768x412.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879-120x64.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/path879.png 1199w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe new architecture of Web Player (left) and Desktop (right) clients.

What features in the existing Desktop application \u003cem\u003ehad\u003c/em\u003e to be implemented in the new one? What should the new client look like? Almost immediately the design and product insight teams began to investigate how our users use our software, so that we could draw up a road map towards being able to ship.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time we created a small “virtual team” made up of engineers from several teams to begin the very first engineering experiments and answer some fundamental questions: Was the desired solution even possible? How much work would it actually require? This virtual team’s priority was simply to get the Web Player, as it was, running inside the Desktop container. They would solve the problem of playback and authentication, explore how the UI was bundled with the container, and set the engineering blueprint for the rest of the project. The team was aided by other teams within Spotify to create a single UI that could run on multiple platforms having different capabilities — for example, televisions. The fact that both codebases were co-located in the same monorepo as a result of previous efforts to converge the clients was key to facilitating this task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter three months, the team’s work concluded successfully. We established our roadmap and priorities, and we knew exactly what we would be doing for the upcoming year. It would require a full commitment from everyone on our wider team, with constant testing and analysis to ensure we were on the correct path. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn reality, this project only happened because of the commitment of our engineering, design, and product management teams to envision a product that engineers could iterate on quickly, and that would fully support the Spotify vision. We had to iterate longer than we’d hoped before shipping to users, but the speed at which the team was able to implement these features in the new shared UI is what gave everyone the confidence that we were heading in the right direction.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eEvaluating success\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe had four primary goals at the start of this project: make our code reusable, unify our user experience and visual design, improve speed to deliver more quickly, and do all of this while meeting Desktop and Web Player users’ needs. With the results of the project now shipped, how have we performed against these metrics?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/04/image3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eReusability\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eReusing the same code in multiple clients (i.e., the Web Player and Desktop) allows us to write the code once and reap the benefits in multiple places. When we need to implement a design change, it’s much more efficient to make it in one location and have it propagate to all receiving endpoints. We would like to expand our reusability in the future, sharing more of our Platform APIs with even more clients.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eUnification\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUser experience and visual design are important yet time-consuming areas to improve within an application. Thus, having one set of components that service multiple clients ensures that we can implement designs more thoroughly, thereby improving our users’ experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCritically, we have been able to achieve a degree of unification with the rest of the Spotify ecosystem, moving our clients to Spotify’s shared design language. The result is a more consistent experience when users switch between mobile and desktop, as well as a more modern, contemporary, accessible, and user-oriented experience for everyone. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e3. \u003cstrong\u003eSpeed\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn important justification for this project was the argument that a modernized codebase with a single, easy-to-understand architecture would increase our velocity as engineers. While we need more time to conclusively prove success in the long term, the large number of features the team has already completed since the project began is a positive indicator. Speed, however, is merely an outcome — the result of engineers with clear goals working with a healthy codebase. We measure code health in terms of test coverage, maintainability, readability, and how easy code is to remove. The architecture we chose had unexpected benefits in terms of making UI coding simpler and easier to understand as developers, and so we are hopeful this platform is going to be a solid foundation for us to build on in the years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e4. \u003cstrong\u003eSatisfaction: Meeting Desktop and Web Player user needs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new experience has been developed with Spotify users in mind — both existing Desktop power users, and new users coming from the mobile app or completely new to the Spotify ecosystem. From the very beginning, we’ve been evaluating and testing our progress at each step to make sure we deliver an experience that fulfills our users’ needs. We’ve conducted extensive user research and run continuous tests over the past year that have informed us of the direction we should take. We’ve made the experience more accessible than ever, so everyone can enjoy using the application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are looking closely at the feedback received and are continuously shaping the application to satisfy users’ needs.

One of the things I love is that, at the moment, our community is small enough for us to know every single customer on a personal level – we can get to know their pain points and problems precisely and really understand the impact of any changes we make. Obviously, I’d love us to grow our customer base and I know it won’t always be possible to be so personally connected.

One of the things I love is that, at the moment, our community is small enough for us to know every single customer on a personal level – we can get to know their pain points and problems precisely and really understand the impact of any changes we make.

Design Systems Engineering Manager at Spotify Tyce Clee talks about his experiences and the benefits of pairing with teams outside your strict discipline. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to becoming an engineering manager, I spent the majority of my career as an engineer, primarily working on web interfaces and applications. The experiences and relationships built during my time as an engineer were essential to a successful transition into management. I’ve had firsthand experience with pairing with many other disciplines to achieve a goal or take a feature to production, and I want to share some of those learnings with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBroaden scope of knowledge (T shape)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEngineers tend to skew towards a particular focus area within their chosen path, allowing for more advanced skills in some areas, but less in others. A JavaScript engineer who loves to work on data visualization, for example, may work less with GraphQL or Node.JS, or a more UI-focused engineer who lives within the world of CSS may not get a ton of exposure to complex routing or performance-based optimizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWithin web engineering, we can look to our other developer colleagues and learn from them and their processes and workflows and bring that back to our discipline. This could be done by embedding with a backend team to understand how to map out an API schema for the very first time, build that together, and finally serve it to the front end. Then, returning to your team as a web engineer, you can have a much better understanding of how the schema was made and exactly what’s returned when making requests. Methods such as these can extend your “T-shapedness” by expanding your knowledge in areas that you don’t necessarily focus on in your day to day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, when pairing with those outside of our discipline, we get to expand our thinking more laterally beyond just code, understanding more of the why and how behind a product-creation process and not just the final piece of the puzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I paired with a UX prototyper, I was able to gain early insights into product inception. This allowed me to get face time with real users through user-testing sessions, to have conversations with product managers on the importance of the new feature or product, and even to pair with designers on early mockups of the UI itself. Then, when the time came to write code, I had a much more well-rounded and cohesive background on the product we were building, and could be more invested in why it’s important for the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStress-test documentation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI had a humbling and great learning moment with a designer who was attempting to write code for the first time on their computer. My team had written and rewritten our contribution documentation multiple times in previous weeks, and were confident it was thorough and had accounted for all use cases and disciplines. One thing we forgot to include, however, was the scenario when a computer had \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e been used for writing code for the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis meant the machine didn’t have Xcode command-line tools, Node.JS, npm, Homebrew, etc. After watching the designer try to figure out why nothing was working, I had to interject and explain what was missing. We then paired on the pull request to update the contribution docs with a new section purely for those who had never run a frontend web environment before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStress-testing your documentation is critical for the success of your product, and we’ve found it best to simply observe when someone is attempting to read through the docs. Try to hold back your thoughts and tips in order to really test what you’ve written down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuild empathy between disciplines\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnderstanding the work that your colleagues do is a key piece to building better products together. One way to achieve this relatively quickly is to spend a “day in the life” with someone outside of your discipline. Go to every meeting, ask questions, take notes and, critically, attempt to do a piece of work as they would.

This could be done by embedding with a backend team to understand how to map out an API schema for the very first time, build that together, and finally serve it to the front end. Then, returning to your team as a web engineer, you can have a much better understanding of how the schema was made and exactly what’s returned when making requests. Methods such as these can extend your “T-shapedness” by expanding your knowledge in areas that you don’t necessarily focus on in your day to day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, when pairing with those outside of our discipline, we get to expand our thinking more laterally beyond just code, understanding more of the why and how behind a product-creation process and not just the final piece of the puzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I paired with a UX prototyper, I was able to gain early insights into product inception.

My team had written and rewritten our contribution documentation multiple times in previous weeks, and were confident it was thorough and had accounted for all use cases and disciplines. One thing we forgot to include, however, was the scenario when a computer had \u003cem\u003enever\u003c/em\u003e been used for writing code for the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis meant the machine didn’t have Xcode command-line tools, Node.JS, npm, Homebrew, etc. After watching the designer try to figure out why nothing was working, I had to interject and explain what was missing.

Design Systems Engineering Manager at Spotify Tyce Clee talks about his experiences and the benefits of pairing with teams outside your strict discipline. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePrior to becoming an engineering manager, I spent the majority of my career as an engineer, primarily working on web interfaces and applications. The experiences and relationships built during my time as an engineer were essential to a successful transition into management. I’ve had firsthand experience with pairing with many other disciplines to achieve a goal or take a feature to production, and I want to share some of those learnings with you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBroaden scope of knowledge (T shape)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eEngineers tend to skew towards a particular focus area within their chosen path, allowing for more advanced skills in some areas, but less in others. A JavaScript engineer who loves to work on data visualization, for example, may work less with GraphQL or Node.JS, or a more UI-focused engineer who lives within the world of CSS may not get a ton of exposure to complex routing or performance-based optimizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWithin web engineering, we can look to our other developer colleagues and learn from them and their processes and workflows and bring that back to our discipline. This could be done by embedding with a backend team to understand how to map out an API schema for the very first time, build that together, and finally serve it to the front end. Then, returning to your team as a web engineer, you can have a much better understanding of how the schema was made and exactly what’s returned when making requests. Methods such as these can extend your “T-shapedness” by expanding your knowledge in areas that you don’t necessarily focus on in your day to day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, when pairing with those outside of our discipline, we get to expand our thinking more laterally beyond just code, understanding more of the why and how behind a product-creation process and not just the final piece of the puzzle.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I paired with a UX prototyper, I was able to gain early insights into product inception. This allowed me to get face time with real users through user-testing sessions, to have conversations with product managers on the importance of the new feature or product, and even to pair with designers on early mockups of the UI itself. Then, when the time came to write code, I had a much more well-rounded and cohesive background on the product we were building, and could be more invested in why it’s important for the business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStress-test documentation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI had a humbling and great learning moment with a designer who was attempting to write code for the first time on their computer.

During that period, we were growing fast. We seemed to be adding new developers, new software components, and new tooling at an equally breakneck pace. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur small, autonomous developer teams have always been our strength. But as we scaled, we didn’t have one way to create a microservice, we had a dozen. We didn’t have one new developer trying to find their way around our stack, we had hundreds. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe faster we grew, the more this fragmentation slowed us down again. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA single pane of glass\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDesigned first as a basic service catalog, our engineering teams began to gravitate to Backstage on their own — recognizing its ability to streamline workflows, help them align with work being done across the organization, and reduce the daily frustrations that slow developers down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt became the “single pane of glass” for all our tooling. Everything our developers needed to create, manage, and monitor their projects was in one place.

(If you’ve heard \u003ca href=\"https://backstage.io/docs/overview/background\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethis story\u003c/a\u003e before, feel free to skip ahead.) \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn March 2020, our internal version of Backstage was already a mature product; our developers had started using a primitive version of it four years earlier. During that period, we were growing fast. We seemed to be adding new developers, new software components, and new tooling at an equally breakneck pace. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur small, autonomous developer teams have always been our strength. But as we scaled, we didn’t have one way to create a microservice, we had a dozen. We didn’t have one new developer trying to find their way around our stack, we had hundreds. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe faster we grew, the more this fragmentation slowed us down again. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA single pane of glass\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDesigned first as a basic service catalog, our engineering teams began to gravitate to Backstage on their own — recognizing its ability to streamline workflows, help them align with work being done across the organization, and reduce the daily frustrations that slow developers down.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt became the “single pane of glass” for all our tooling. Everything our developers needed to create, manage, and monitor their projects was in one place. We began to rely on Backstage more and more — from managing data pipelines to software migrations — until it became the hub for all our development work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith Backstage, infrastructure tooling got out of our engineers’ way so they could build and test faster. And since it simplified discovery — from ownership and documentation to best practices — we could onboard new developers faster, too. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpeed was the key. We saw firsthand that faster developers aren’t just \u003ca href=\"https://martinfowler.com/articles/developer-effectiveness.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003emore productive developers\u003c/a\u003e, they’re happier developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFrom internal portal to open platform\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s the biggest difference between the internal version of Backstage and the version we released a year ago? We didn’t want to ship you Spotify’s developer portal. We wanted to ship the best platform for you to build your own developer portal — one that fits your particular needs and use cases.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eUnlike \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/04/21/how-we-use-backstage-at-spotify/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ethe internal version of Backstage\u003c/a\u003e, which has more than 120 different \u003ca href=\"https://backstage.io/docs/FAQ#what-is-a-plugin-in-backstage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eplugins\u003c/a\u003e built by 60 different teams, the first open source version was mostly an empty shell.

Coordinating these experiments, i.e., making sure the right user is receiving the right “treatment” with a population of hundreds of millions of users, poses technical challenges. Adding to the complexity, some of these experiments must be coordinated in the sense that the same user cannot be in two experiments at the same time. These are well-known problems among tech companies — take, for example, Google’s solution in Tang et al (2010). But the statistical implications of different solutions have not been properly investigated. In a recent paper (\u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10202\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eM. Schultzberg, O. Kjellin, and J. Rydberg, 2020\u003c/a\u003e), we investigate important statistical properties of a common technical solution to the coordination — called “Bucket Reuse”. In this blog post we highlight some interesting results and present some details about how Spotify will coordinate experiments from now on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Bucket Reuse?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBucket Reuse is a simple idea utilizing the power of hashing. Essentially the steps are as follows: decide on a number of buckets (B). Take the unique user ID and hash it together with a  random salt into B “buckets” such that all users hash into one and only one bucket. Once the hash map is established, all sampling is performed on the bucket level. This implies that a bucket either is or is not in a sample at any given time point. If we want to sample N number of users, we sample the number of buckets that contain the number of users closest to the desired number N. If, e.g., the desired N is 20 and each bucket contains 3 users, we would sample 7 buckets and end up with 21 users. Note that a bucket is simply a logical group of units to which we assign a certain user by a fixed hash map. Figure 1 illustrates such a map. The second part of the name Bucket \u003cem\u003eReuse\u003c/em\u003e comes from the fact that we reuse the same buckets over and over again in the sampling for all experiments. That is, the random salt for the hashing is selected only once; after that, the hash map and the number of buckets is fixed. \u003cstrong\u003eImportantly,\u003c/strong\u003e when we talk about Bucket Reuse for experimentation, we always mean the following: the random sampling is performed on the bucket level; the random treatment allocation is performed at the user level on the users in the sample. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image4-700x625.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image4-700x625.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image4-250x223.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image4-768x686.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image4-120x107.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image4.png 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 1: \u003cem\u003eSchematic illustration of a hash map.

Figure 2 illustrates the concepts of exclusive and nonexclusive experiments. That two or more experiments “are exclusive” to each other simply means that they are run on distinct sets of users. Experiments that are nonexclusive are nonexclusive to \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e experiments at Spotify, meaning that they all randomly overlap in terms of users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image5-700x383.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image5-700x383.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image5-250x137.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image5-768x420.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image5-120x66.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/image5.png 1498w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 2: \u003cem\u003eIllustration of exclusive and nonexclusive experiments. Exclusive experiments never overlap with each other in terms of users; nonexclusive experiments randomly overlap with exclusive experiments and other nonexclusive experiments. Note that the allocations in this figure were selected for illustration; in a true random sample we would expect exclusive experiments to also be spread out uniformly.  \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most critical challenge from a statistical perspective is imposed by what we call \u003cem\u003eprograms of exclusive experiments\u003c/em\u003e. A program of exclusive experiments is a set of experiments run over time where all simultaneous experiments are exclusive to each other. That is, a unit is in at most one, and only one, of the experiments in the program at any given time point. At Spotify we have such programs for several surfaces in the app, for example Search, the Home screen, and certain parts of the backend code base. To better understand the limitations imposed on the sampling by running programs of exclusive experiments, it is helpful to introduce the concepts of paths. A path is simply a sequence of experiments that a unit can be in. Figure 3 illustrates a program of exclusive experiments containing 5 experiments over time. Below the experiments, their possible paths are displayed. For example, it is not possible to go through both Experiments 3 and 4 as they overlap in time and are exclusive, and must therefore be run on distinct users. The number of unique possible paths explodes combinatorially after a relatively short time period in most programs, and only a small partition of the possible paths can be taken by any unit regardless of the sample strategies discussed in this post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"806\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-700x806.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-700x806.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-250x288.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-768x885.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-1334x1536.png 1334w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-120x138.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3.png 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 3: \u003cem\u003ePaths of experiences possible during a hypothetical program of 5 exclusive experiments.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHighlights from \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10202\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSchultzberg et al.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSchultzberg et al. presents two key results:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnder unrestricted sampling of buckets, i.e., Bucket Reuse in nonexclusive experiments, the properties of the difference-in-means estimator of the average treatment effect is approximately equivalent to the properties under random sampling of units. In other words, standard t-tests can be used for inference. The key to this remarkable finding is connecting Bucket Reuse to the existing literature on randomized experiments embedded in complex sampling designs (Horvitz and Thompson, 1952;  van den Brakel and Renssen, 2005). \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe bias imposed by the restricted sampling of buckets implied by programs of exclusive experiments is derived. It is shown that this bias is often restricted to the history right before the experiment. Moreover, the length of the window of the history that affects the bias can be estimated for any empirical experimentation program. One way to phrase this finding is that the sample at a time point T is not random with respect to the last D days leading up to time T, but random with respect to everything that happened before the time point T-D. If things happened during the last D days that make the set of buckets available for sampling at time T different from the population with respect to the treatment effect, the estimator is biased. This insight makes it possible for experimenters to evaluate the risk for biases by checking what experiments have been run in the program over the last D days, and if those risks for biases are likely to affect the average treatment effect in the experiment that is about to be started. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSpotify’s new experimentation coordination strategy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have migrated our experimentation platform to using Bucket Reuse for all experiments at Spotify. There are a few key reasons why we prefer Bucket Reuse over other solutions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt is simple to implement and understand. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt is a technically feasible solution that allows us to do complex coordination without losing speed in our systems. As new users come into Spotify, they are uniformly hashed into the existing buckets — that is, the system scales as Spotify’s user base grows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUsing one company-global bucket structure makes it easy to coordinate experiments arbitrarily. For example, two programs that have been run independently can easily be merged into one program of exclusive experiments at any time point for any period of time. And, a sample from a previous experiment with a broken experience can easily be quarantined and avoided in any future experiments, as the sampling units are always the same over time.  \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify we have chosen Bucket Reuse with 1M (1,000,000) buckets to coordinate all experiments. That is, all users are hashed into 1M buckets, and these buckets are used for all experiments in all experimentation programs, exclusive and nonexclusive. Although Schultzberg et al.  establishes that smaller numbers of buckets can have statistical properties enabling straight forward inference, it should be clear that the larger the number of buckets, the better. Even though the inference for the average treatment effect is unaffected by the bucket sampling, it is well known that the effect of cluster sampling on other estimands decreases when the number of buckets increases (Kumar Pradhan). That is, imposing a bucket structure is not preferred from a statistical perspective, but it is a technical necessity. The choice of 1M buckets was made because it is close to the largest number of buckets we can have while still keeping the selected buckets within an executable script stored in a database without having to resort to \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBLOB\u003c/a\u003e storage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are not planning to have any full stops or to reshuffle users into new buckets. However, there are naturally occurring periods of low experimentation that will help decrease the dependency between the samples in programs of exclusive experiments. For example, many programs run fewer general product experiments over the winter holidays due to unusual listening behaviors. These natural pauses effectively reset the programs in terms of dependencies.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo help experimenters running programs of exclusive experiments, we are implementing a few tools to keep track of the short-term dependencies. For each program, we will estimate the length of the history that can bias the results. Moreover, we are also implementing a tool to see the history of the available buckets at any time point. Figure 4 displays a prototype of this tool. It allows experimenters to evaluate if the experiments that the available user came out of are likely to bias the estimator in their experiment. It also provides information about the size of the overlap with previous experiments. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1394\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/03/2020-10-23-10.58.56.gif\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 4: \u003cem\u003eDependency graph that shows the experimenter where the free space, and thereby their sample, will come from in terms of previous experiments in the exclusive program.

Coordinating these experiments, i.e., making sure the right user is receiving the right “treatment” with a population of hundreds of millions of users, poses technical challenges. Adding to the complexity, some of these experiments must be coordinated in the sense that the same user cannot be in two experiments at the same time. These are well-known problems among tech companies — take, for example, Google’s solution in Tang et al (2010). But the statistical implications of different solutions have not been properly investigated. In a recent paper (\u003ca href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-89906-6_50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eM. Schultzberg, O. Kjellin, and J. Rydberg, 2020\u003c/a\u003e), we investigate important statistical properties of a common technical solution to the coordination — called “Bucket Reuse”. In this blog post we highlight some interesting results and present some details about how Spotify will coordinate experiments from now on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Bucket Reuse?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBucket Reuse is a simple idea utilizing the power of hashing. Essentially the steps are as follows: decide on a number of buckets (B). Take the unique user ID and hash it together with a  random salt into B “buckets” such that all users hash into one and only one bucket. Once the hash map is established, all sampling is performed on the bucket level. This implies that a bucket either is or is not in a sample at any given time point. If we want to sample N number of users, we sample the number of buckets that contain the number of users closest to the desired number N. If, e.g., the desired N is 20 and each bucket contains 3 users, we would sample 7 buckets and end up with 21 users. Note that a bucket is simply a logical group of units to which we assign a certain user by a fixed hash map. Figure 1 illustrates such a map. The second part of the name Bucket \u003cem\u003eReuse\u003c/em\u003e comes from the fact that we reuse the same buckets over and over again in the sampling for all experiments. That is, the random salt for the hashing is selected only once; after that, the hash map and the number of buckets is fixed. \u003cstrong\u003eImportantly,\u003c/strong\u003e when we talk about Bucket Reuse for experimentation, we always mean the following: the random sampling is performed on the bucket level; the random treatment allocation is performed at the user level on the users in the sample. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4-700x625.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4-700x625.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4-250x223.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4-768x686.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4-120x107.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4.png 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 1: \u003cem\u003eSchematic illustration of a hash map.

Figure 2 illustrates the concepts of exclusive and nonexclusive experiments. That two or more experiments “are exclusive” to each other simply means that they are run on distinct sets of users. Experiments that are nonexclusive are nonexclusive to \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e experiments at Spotify, meaning that they all randomly overlap in terms of users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5-700x383.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5-700x383.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5-250x137.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5-768x420.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5-120x66.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5.png 1498w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 2: \u003cem\u003eIllustration of exclusive and nonexclusive experiments. Exclusive experiments never overlap with each other in terms of users; nonexclusive experiments randomly overlap with exclusive experiments and other nonexclusive experiments. Note that the allocations in this figure were selected for illustration; in a true random sample we would expect exclusive experiments to also be spread out uniformly.  \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most critical challenge from a statistical perspective is imposed by what we call \u003cem\u003eprograms of exclusive experiments\u003c/em\u003e. A program of exclusive experiments is a set of experiments run over time where all simultaneous experiments are exclusive to each other. That is, a unit is in at most one, and only one, of the experiments in the program at any given time point. At Spotify we have such programs for several surfaces in the app, for example Search, the Home screen, and certain parts of the backend code base. To better understand the limitations imposed on the sampling by running programs of exclusive experiments, it is helpful to introduce the concepts of paths. A path is simply a sequence of experiments that a unit can be in. Figure 3 illustrates a program of exclusive experiments containing 5 experiments over time. Below the experiments, their possible paths are displayed. For example, it is not possible to go through both Experiments 3 and 4 as they overlap in time and are exclusive, and must therefore be run on distinct users. The number of unique possible paths explodes combinatorially after a relatively short time period in most programs, and only a small partition of the possible paths can be taken by any unit regardless of the sample strategies discussed in this post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"806\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-700x806.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-700x806.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-250x288.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-768x885.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-1334x1536.png 1334w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-120x138.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3.png 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 3: \u003cem\u003ePaths of experiences possible during a hypothetical program of 5 exclusive experiments.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHighlights from \u003ca href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-89906-6_50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSchultzberg et al.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSchultzberg et al. presents two key results:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnder unrestricted sampling of buckets, i.e., Bucket Reuse in nonexclusive experiments, the properties of the difference-in-means estimator of the average treatment effect is approximately equivalent to the properties under random sampling of units. In other words, standard t-tests can be used for inference. The key to this remarkable finding is connecting Bucket Reuse to the existing literature on randomized experiments embedded in complex sampling designs (Horvitz and Thompson, 1952;  van den Brakel and Renssen, 2005). \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe bias imposed by the restricted sampling of buckets implied by programs of exclusive experiments is derived. It is shown that this bias is often restricted to the history right before the experiment. Moreover, the length of the window of the history that affects the bias can be estimated for any empirical experimentation program. One way to phrase this finding is that the sample at a time point T is not random with respect to the last D days leading up to time T, but random with respect to everything that happened before the time point T-D. If things happened during the last D days that make the set of buckets available for sampling at time T different from the population with respect to the treatment effect, the estimator is biased. This insight makes it possible for experimenters to evaluate the risk for biases by checking what experiments have been run in the program over the last D days, and if those risks for biases are likely to affect the average treatment effect in the experiment that is about to be started. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSpotify’s new experimentation coordination strategy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have migrated our experimentation platform to using Bucket Reuse for all experiments at Spotify. There are a few key reasons why we prefer Bucket Reuse over other solutions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt is simple to implement and understand. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt is a technically feasible solution that allows us to do complex coordination without losing speed in our systems. As new users come into Spotify, they are uniformly hashed into the existing buckets — that is, the system scales as Spotify’s user base grows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUsing one company-global bucket structure makes it easy to coordinate experiments arbitrarily. For example, two programs that have been run independently can easily be merged into one program of exclusive experiments at any time point for any period of time. And, a sample from a previous experiment with a broken experience can easily be quarantined and avoided in any future experiments, as the sampling units are always the same over time.  \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify we have chosen Bucket Reuse with 1M (1,000,000) buckets to coordinate all experiments. That is, all users are hashed into 1M buckets, and these buckets are used for all experiments in all experimentation programs, exclusive and nonexclusive. Although Schultzberg et al.  establishes that smaller numbers of buckets can have statistical properties enabling straight forward inference, it should be clear that the larger the number of buckets, the better. Even though the inference for the average treatment effect is unaffected by the bucket sampling, it is well known that the effect of cluster sampling on other estimands decreases when the number of buckets increases (Kumar Pradhan). That is, imposing a bucket structure is not preferred from a statistical perspective, but it is a technical necessity. The choice of 1M buckets was made because it is close to the largest number of buckets we can have while still keeping the selected buckets within an executable script stored in a database without having to resort to \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBLOB\u003c/a\u003e storage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are not planning to have any full stops or to reshuffle users into new buckets. However, there are naturally occurring periods of low experimentation that will help decrease the dependency between the samples in programs of exclusive experiments. For example, many programs run fewer general product experiments over the winter holidays due to unusual listening behaviors. These natural pauses effectively reset the programs in terms of dependencies.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo help experimenters running programs of exclusive experiments, we are implementing a few tools to keep track of the short-term dependencies. For each program, we will estimate the length of the history that can bias the results. Moreover, we are also implementing a tool to see the history of the available buckets at any time point. Figure 4 displays a prototype of this tool. It allows experimenters to evaluate if the experiments that the available user came out of are likely to bias the estimator in their experiment. It also provides information about the size of the overlap with previous experiments. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1394\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2020-10-23-10.58.56.gif\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 4: \u003cem\u003eDependency graph that shows the experimenter where the free space, and thereby their sample, will come from in terms of previous experiments in the exclusive program.

Coordinating these experiments, i.e., making sure the right user is receiving the right “treatment” with a population of hundreds of millions of users, poses technical challenges. Adding to the complexity, some of these experiments must be coordinated in the sense that the same user cannot be in two experiments at the same time. These are well-known problems among tech companies — take, for example, Google’s solution in Tang et al (2010). But the statistical implications of different solutions have not been properly investigated. In a recent paper (\u003ca href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-89906-6_50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eM. Schultzberg, O. Kjellin, and J. Rydberg, 2020\u003c/a\u003e), we investigate important statistical properties of a common technical solution to the coordination — called “Bucket Reuse”. In this blog post we highlight some interesting results and present some details about how Spotify will coordinate experiments from now on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Bucket Reuse?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBucket Reuse is a simple idea utilizing the power of hashing. Essentially the steps are as follows: decide on a number of buckets (B). Take the unique user ID and hash it together with a  random salt into B “buckets” such that all users hash into one and only one bucket. Once the hash map is established, all sampling is performed on the bucket level. This implies that a bucket either is or is not in a sample at any given time point. If we want to sample N number of users, we sample the number of buckets that contain the number of users closest to the desired number N. If, e.g., the desired N is 20 and each bucket contains 3 users, we would sample 7 buckets and end up with 21 users. Note that a bucket is simply a logical group of units to which we assign a certain user by a fixed hash map. Figure 1 illustrates such a map. The second part of the name Bucket \u003cem\u003eReuse\u003c/em\u003e comes from the fact that we reuse the same buckets over and over again in the sampling for all experiments. That is, the random salt for the hashing is selected only once; after that, the hash map and the number of buckets is fixed. \u003cstrong\u003eImportantly,\u003c/strong\u003e when we talk about Bucket Reuse for experimentation, we always mean the following: the random sampling is performed on the bucket level; the random treatment allocation is performed at the user level on the users in the sample. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"625\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4-700x625.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4-700x625.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4-250x223.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4-768x686.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4-120x107.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image4.png 1366w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 1: \u003cem\u003eSchematic illustration of a hash map.

Figure 2 illustrates the concepts of exclusive and nonexclusive experiments. That two or more experiments “are exclusive” to each other simply means that they are run on distinct sets of users. Experiments that are nonexclusive are nonexclusive to \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e experiments at Spotify, meaning that they all randomly overlap in terms of users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"383\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5-700x383.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5-700x383.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5-250x137.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5-768x420.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5-120x66.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/image5.png 1498w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 2: \u003cem\u003eIllustration of exclusive and nonexclusive experiments. Exclusive experiments never overlap with each other in terms of users; nonexclusive experiments randomly overlap with exclusive experiments and other nonexclusive experiments. Note that the allocations in this figure were selected for illustration; in a true random sample we would expect exclusive experiments to also be spread out uniformly.  \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe most critical challenge from a statistical perspective is imposed by what we call \u003cem\u003eprograms of exclusive experiments\u003c/em\u003e. A program of exclusive experiments is a set of experiments run over time where all simultaneous experiments are exclusive to each other. That is, a unit is in at most one, and only one, of the experiments in the program at any given time point. At Spotify we have such programs for several surfaces in the app, for example Search, the Home screen, and certain parts of the backend code base. To better understand the limitations imposed on the sampling by running programs of exclusive experiments, it is helpful to introduce the concepts of paths. A path is simply a sequence of experiments that a unit can be in. Figure 3 illustrates a program of exclusive experiments containing 5 experiments over time. Below the experiments, their possible paths are displayed. For example, it is not possible to go through both Experiments 3 and 4 as they overlap in time and are exclusive, and must therefore be run on distinct users. The number of unique possible paths explodes combinatorially after a relatively short time period in most programs, and only a small partition of the possible paths can be taken by any unit regardless of the sample strategies discussed in this post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"806\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-700x806.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-700x806.png 700w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-250x288.png 250w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-768x885.png 768w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-1334x1536.png 1334w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3-120x138.png 120w, https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Figure3.png 1370w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 3: \u003cem\u003ePaths of experiences possible during a hypothetical program of 5 exclusive experiments.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eHighlights from \u003ca href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-89906-6_50\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSchultzberg et al.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSchultzberg et al. presents two key results:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnder unrestricted sampling of buckets, i.e., Bucket Reuse in nonexclusive experiments, the properties of the difference-in-means estimator of the average treatment effect is approximately equivalent to the properties under random sampling of units. In other words, standard t-tests can be used for inference. The key to this remarkable finding is connecting Bucket Reuse to the existing literature on randomized experiments embedded in complex sampling designs (Horvitz and Thompson, 1952;  van den Brakel and Renssen, 2005). \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col start=\"2\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe bias imposed by the restricted sampling of buckets implied by programs of exclusive experiments is derived. It is shown that this bias is often restricted to the history right before the experiment. Moreover, the length of the window of the history that affects the bias can be estimated for any empirical experimentation program. One way to phrase this finding is that the sample at a time point T is not random with respect to the last D days leading up to time T, but random with respect to everything that happened before the time point T-D. If things happened during the last D days that make the set of buckets available for sampling at time T different from the population with respect to the treatment effect, the estimator is biased. This insight makes it possible for experimenters to evaluate the risk for biases by checking what experiments have been run in the program over the last D days, and if those risks for biases are likely to affect the average treatment effect in the experiment that is about to be started. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSpotify’s new experimentation coordination strategy\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have migrated our experimentation platform to using Bucket Reuse for all experiments at Spotify. There are a few key reasons why we prefer Bucket Reuse over other solutions:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt is simple to implement and understand. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt is a technically feasible solution that allows us to do complex coordination without losing speed in our systems. As new users come into Spotify, they are uniformly hashed into the existing buckets — that is, the system scales as Spotify’s user base grows.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUsing one company-global bucket structure makes it easy to coordinate experiments arbitrarily. For example, two programs that have been run independently can easily be merged into one program of exclusive experiments at any time point for any period of time. And, a sample from a previous experiment with a broken experience can easily be quarantined and avoided in any future experiments, as the sampling units are always the same over time.  \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify we have chosen Bucket Reuse with 1M (1,000,000) buckets to coordinate all experiments. That is, all users are hashed into 1M buckets, and these buckets are used for all experiments in all experimentation programs, exclusive and nonexclusive. Although Schultzberg et al.  establishes that smaller numbers of buckets can have statistical properties enabling straight forward inference, it should be clear that the larger the number of buckets, the better. Even though the inference for the average treatment effect is unaffected by the bucket sampling, it is well known that the effect of cluster sampling on other estimands decreases when the number of buckets increases (Kumar Pradhan). That is, imposing a bucket structure is not preferred from a statistical perspective, but it is a technical necessity. The choice of 1M buckets was made because it is close to the largest number of buckets we can have while still keeping the selected buckets within an executable script stored in a database without having to resort to \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBLOB\u003c/a\u003e storage. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are not planning to have any full stops or to reshuffle users into new buckets. However, there are naturally occurring periods of low experimentation that will help decrease the dependency between the samples in programs of exclusive experiments. For example, many programs run fewer general product experiments over the winter holidays due to unusual listening behaviors. These natural pauses effectively reset the programs in terms of dependencies.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo help experimenters running programs of exclusive experiments, we are implementing a few tools to keep track of the short-term dependencies. For each program, we will estimate the length of the history that can bias the results. Moreover, we are also implementing a tool to see the history of the available buckets at any time point. Figure 4 displays a prototype of this tool. It allows experimenters to evaluate if the experiments that the available user came out of are likely to bias the estimator in their experiment. It also provides information about the size of the overlap with previous experiments. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1394\" src=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/2020-10-23-10.58.56.gif\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFigure 4: \u003cem\u003eDependency graph that shows the experimenter where the free space, and thereby their sample, will come from in terms of previous experiments in the exclusive program. Each rectangle corresponds to a previously run experiment. The numbers in the yellow circles indicate the percentage points of the population that went from one experiment into another, and finally into the proportion of the population that is available (“free space”) for sampling right now. The experimenter can see what effects the previous experiments had on the metrics of interest in their experiment. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cem\u003eFigure above for illustrative purposes only.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStatistical validity, derived from proper random sampling and random treatment allocation, is the cornerstone of a successful experimentation program. However, implementing systems that can serve hundreds of experiments to hundreds of millions users — while retaining the ability to conveniently coordinate experiments to be exclusive, without overlap — requires compromises between technical feasibility and statistical properties. At Spotify, we have migrated the internal experimentation platform to rely fully on \u003cem\u003ebucket reuse\u003c/em\u003e, a technically desirable solution that provides speed, simplicity, and flexibility. In this post we establish the statistical properties under bucket reuse and conclude that the validity is unaffected.

Which means I get up around 8am, drink lots of coffee (way too much!) and log onto my computer an hour later – ready to check my messages and start getting my brain into thinking mode. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e10:00am\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy team is actually based in New York, so I tend to work 10–6 to overlap as much as possible with their hours. But the time difference means my mornings are fairly quiet and meeting-free – a chance for me to get down to focussed, individual tasks, without too many interruptions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMy work is mostly to do with Kubernetes – the technology we use to deploy our services at Spotify – and a lot of my time is spent helping other engineers get to grips with the system, debugging their issues and developing our infrastructure services, so they can deploy more easily and reliably. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRecently, I’ve been working on something called the k8s plug in, which vastly simplifies the Kubernetes experience for developers and means they can operate without a huge understanding of the platform under the hood. Earlier this year, we open-sourced this plug in, which felt like a really great moment – it’s amazing to think it’s now available to everyone in the tech community worldwide and can benefit so many people outside our organization. That to me is the magical thing about open-source. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e1:00pm\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI try to grab a bite to eat around 1pm, although I’m really bad at taking breaks – I get so sucked into what I’m doing that I forget the time, especially if I’m coding. It used to happen when I worked in the office too, even though there was an awesome canteen and a table tennis table to tempt me away from my desk!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e2:00pm\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is when New York starts to wake up, so my work becomes more team-based – I often pair remotely with one of the developers out there, which means jumping on a hangout and sharing our screens, so we can collaborate on a piece of code. Alternatively, we might work together to write documents like RFCs, debug production issues or help other developers with their infrastructure issues. It’s a bit of a mix, really, \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWeirdly, I’ve only met one of team-mates in real life, when I first joined up and spent two weeks in the New York office as part of an embed. But we still all work together really well – it’s friendly and we joke around a lot. I think there are some rules you need to learn for remote working and being in different zones – you need to be a bit flexible and not always expect to get your answers straight away. But once you’ve got used to that, things are surprisingly easy – it’s really not a big deal at all. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e6:00pm \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI usually finish up at 6ish, although I’m terrible for checking my emails in the evening. To try and switch off, I watch TV, listen to podcasts or play video games – I also started up an engineering book club at the start of the first lockdown. And I’m really into cooking at the moment – there’s something about following a recipe and going through a series of orchestrated steps that reminds me of coding. Although, as the old joke goes, at least your potato peeler never turns out to be ten versions out of date… \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"111\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering-700x111.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering-700x111.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering-250x40.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering-768x121.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering-120x19.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/11/My-Beat-Breakdown-Engineering.png 1525w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"557\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/MyBeat_Matt-Clarke-graph-700x557.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/MyBeat_Matt-Clarke-graph-700x557.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/MyBeat_Matt-Clarke-graph-250x199.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/MyBeat_Matt-Clarke-graph-768x611.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/MyBeat_Matt-Clarke-graph-120x96.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/MyBeat_Matt-Clarke-graph.png 1520w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n         \n         \n\n         \u003cp\u003e\n             Published by Spotify Engineering         \u003c/p\u003e\n     \u003c/div\u003e\n\n     \n     \n\n\n \u003c/article\u003e\n                \n\n            \n        \n    \u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

Backstage Kubernetes simplifies your deployment workflow by connecting to your existing Kubernetes implementation and aggregating the status of all your deployments into a single view — even across multiple clusters in multiple regions. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eNavigating the complexity of Kubernetes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re building a service today, you’re likely deploying it as a container, which is inside a pod, which is inside a cluster (alongside a bunch of other services that don’t belong to you), with deployments on different clusters spinning up and down all around the world. It can be hard to keep track of everything.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut despite widespread adoption of Kubernetes, all the tools for navigating this complexity have been focussed on the needs of cluster admins. This can make something as simple as checking the health of your service somewhat complicated. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s why we built a Kubernetes monitoring tool focussed on the needs of service owners and made it a core feature of \u003ca href=\"https://backstage.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBackstage\u003c/a\u003e, our open platform for building developer portals. We wanted to make the experience of managing services deployed on Kubernetes easier for all developers. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut first, how did we get here?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe rise of Kubernetes and DevOps\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince its release in 2014, Kubernetes has become one of the most widely adopted and important open source projects. Capabilities like autoscaling and cost optimisation through container scheduling used to be time-consuming and tricky to get right — now they’ve been democratised. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, the concept of DevOps has become mainstream. Developers now regularly perform tasks that were traditionally the domain of operations experts. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, while everyday engineers can do more than ever before, their new powers have also come along with a new set of responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eNew powers, shifting roles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I first started using Kubernetes, cluster admins and service owners were one and the same: the people who built a cluster were usually the same people who owned the services that ran in the cluster. That’s not how it is today. As Kubernetes has achieved widespread adoption there has been a shift in Kubernetes usage as well as a shift in how Kubernetes is managed at the organisation level. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow organisations tend to have a separate infrastructure team (sometimes not-so-ironically called the “DevOps” team) who build and maintain clusters for the feature developers and service owners. As the teams have become more specialized, the setups have become more advanced. For instance, the infrastructure team might set up Kubernetes clusters in multiple geographic regions in order to reduce end-user latency, wherever the user is in the world. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a better experience for the user, and it’s an optimization you might not have considered before Kubernetes existed or without a dedicated infrastructure team. But it also comes with productivity costs for the developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFrustration also scales\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen your deployment environment reaches this kind of complexity and scale, the maintenance overhead for service owners increases. It forces them to use multiple kubectl contexts or multiple UIs just to get an overall view of their system. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a small overhead — but adds up over time — and multiplies as service owners build more services and deploy them to more regions. Just checking the status of a service first requires hunting for it across multiple clusters. This can reduce productivity (and patience) company-wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eBetter tools for the job\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe believed we could solve the problem through developer tooling. But we soon discovered the available tools weren’t suitable, because they:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDon’t cater well for deploying to multiple Kubernetes clusters,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUsually require that users have clusterwide permissions, or\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDisplay everything on a cluster and aren’t focused on the service the user cares about.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we often do when we want to \u003ca href=\"https://backstage.io/blog/2020/10/22/cost-insights-plugin\"\u003esolve a problem involving infrastructure complexity\u003c/a\u003e, we wondered, why not build a custom plugin for Backstage, our homegrown developer portal?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eBackstage Kubernetes: Manage your services, not clusters\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBackstage provides vital information from Kubernetes — specifically focussed on the developer’s service.

We’ll present the design and implementation of SMB and how we incorporated it into our data pipelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eShuffle is the core building block for many big data transforms, such as a join, GroupByKey, or other reduce operations. Unfortunately, it’s also one of the most expensive steps in many pipelines. Sort Merge Bucket is an optimization that reduces shuffle by doing work up front on the producer side. The intuition is that for datasets commonly and frequently joined on a known key, e.g., user events with user metadata on a user ID, we can write them in bucket files with records bucketed and sorted by that key. By knowing which files contain a subset of keys and in what order, shuffle becomes a matter of merge-sorting values from matching bucket files, completely eliminating costly disk and network I/O of moving key–value pairs around. Andrea Nardelli carried out the original investigation on Sort Merge Buckets for his \u003ca href=\"http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1334587/FULLTEXT01.pdf\"\u003e2018 master’s thesis\u003c/a\u003e, and we started looking into generalizing the idea as a \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://spotify.github.io/scio/extras/Sort-Merge-Bucket.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eScio module\u003c/a\u003e afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDesign and Implementation\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe majority of the data pipelines at Spotify are written in \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://github.com/spotify/scio\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eScio\u003c/a\u003e, a Scala API for \u003ca href=\"https://beam.apache.org/\"\u003eApache Beam\u003c/a\u003e, and run on the \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/dataflow\"\u003eGoogle Cloud Dataflow\u003c/a\u003e service.

Since we need fine-grained control over the exact elements and their order in every file, we cannot leverage the existing Beam file I/Os, which operate on a PCollection level and abstract away the locality and order of elements. Instead, SMB file operations happen at a lower level of BoundedSource for input and ParDo for output. Currently Avro, BigQuery TableRow JSON, and TensorFlow TFRecord/Example records are supported. We plan to add other formats like Parquet as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eBucketMetadata\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis class abstracts the keying and bucketing of elements, and includes information such as key field, class, number of buckets, shards, and hash function. The metadata is serialized as a JSON file alongside data files when writing, and used to check compatibility when reading SMB sources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003eOptimizations and Variants\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver the last year and a half we’ve been adopting SMB at Spotify for various use cases, and accumulated many improvements to handle the scale and complexity of our data pipelines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDate partitioning:\u003c/strong\u003e At Spotify, event data is written to Google Cloud Services (GCS) in hourly or daily partitions. A common data engineering use case is to read many partitions in a single pipeline — for example, to compute stream count over the last seven days. For a non-SMB read, this can be easily done in a single PTransform using wildcard file patterns to match files across multiple directories. However, unlike most File I/Os in Beam, the SMB Read API requires the input to be specified as a directory, rather than a file pattern (this is because we need to check the directory’s metadata.json file as well as the actual record files). Additionally, it must match up bucket files across partitions as well as across different sources, while ensuring that the CoGbkResult output correctly groups data from all partitions of a source into the same TupleTag key. We evolved the SMB Read API to accept one or more directories \u003cem\u003eper source\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSharding:\u003c/strong\u003e Although the Murmur class of hash functions we use during bucket assignment usually ensures an even distribution of records across buckets, in some instances one or more buckets may be disproportionately large if the key space is skewed, creating possible OOM errors when grouping and sorting records. In this case, we allow users to specify a number of \u003cem\u003eshards\u003c/em\u003e to further split each bucket file. During the bucket assignment step, a value between [0, numShards) is generated randomly \u003ca href=\"https://beam.apache.org/documentation/runtime/model/#bundling-and-persistence\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eper bundle\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Since this value is computed completely orthogonally to the bucket ID, it can break up large key groups across files. Since each shard is still written in sorted order, they can simply be merged together at read time.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eParallelism:\u003c/strong\u003e Since the number of buckets in an SMB sink is always a power of 2, we can come up with a joining scheme across sources with different numbers of buckets based off of a desired level of parallelism specified by the user. For example, if the user wants to join Source 1 with 4 buckets and Source 2 with 2 buckets, they can specify either:\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMinimum parallelism,\u003c/strong\u003e or “Merge Greatest Buckets” strategy: 2 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 2 buckets from source A and 1 from source B, merging them together. Because bucket IDs are assigned by taking the integer hash value of the key modulo the desired number of buckets, mathematically we know that the key spaces of the merged buckets overlap.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaximum parallelism,\u003c/strong\u003e or “Least Bucket Replication” strategy: 4 parallel readers will be created. Each reader will read 1 bucket from Source A and 1 from Source B. After merging each key group, the reader will have to rehash the key modulo the greatest number of buckets, to avoid emitting duplicate values. Therefore, even though this strategy achieves a higher level of parallelism, there is some overhead of computing duplicate values and rehashing to eliminate them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAuto parallelism:\u003c/strong\u003e Creates a number of readers between minimal and maximal amounts, based on a desired split size value provided by the Runner at runtime.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"459\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-700x459.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-700x459.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-250x164.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-768x504.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3-120x79.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image3.png 1115w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSortedBucketTransform:\u003c/strong\u003e A common usage pattern is for pipelines to enrich an existing dataset by joining it with one or more other sources, then writing it to an output location. We decided to specifically support this in SMB with a unique PTransform that reads, transforms, and writes output using the same keying and bucketing scheme. By doing the read/transform/write logic per bucket on the same worker, we can avoid having to reshuffle the data and recompute buckets — since the key is the same, we know that the transformed elements from bucket M of the inputs also correspond to bucket M in the output, in the same sorted order as they were read from.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-700x320.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-700x320.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-250x114.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-768x351.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4-120x55.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image4.png 902w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExternal Sort:\u003c/strong\u003e We made a number of improvements to Beam’s \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/apache/beam/tree/master/sdks/java/extensions/sorter\"\u003eexternal sorter extension\u003c/a\u003e, including replacing the Hadoop sequence file with the native file I/O, removing the 2GB memory limit, and reducing disk usage and coder overhead.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eAdoption — Core Data Producers\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSince SMB requires data to be bucketed and sorted in a specific fashion, the adoption naturally starts from the producer of that data. A majority of the Spotify data processing relies on a few core data sets that act as single sources of truth for various business domains like streaming activities, user metadata and streaming context. We worked with the maintainer of these data sets to convert a year’s worth of data to SMB format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eImplementation was straightforward since SortedBucketSink is mostly a drop-in replacement for the vanilla Avro sink with some extra settings. We were using Avro sink with the sharding option to control the number and size of output files. After migrating to SMB, we did not notice any major bump in terms of vCPU, vRAM, or wall time since sharding requires a full shuffle similar to the additional cost of SMB sinks. A few other settings we have since had to tweak:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAgree on user_id as a hexadecimal string as bucket and sort key, since we need the same key type and semantic across all SMB datasets.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSet compression to DEFLATE with level 6 to be consistent with the default Avro sink in Scio. As a nice side effect of data being bucketed and sorted by key, we observed ~50% reduction in storage from better compression due to collocation of similar records.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake sure output files are backwards compatible. SMB output files have “bucket-X-shard-Y” in their names but otherwise contain the same records with the same schema. So existing pipelines can consume them without any code change; they just do not leverage the speedup in certain join cases.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eAdoption — Wrapped 2020\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnce the core datasets were available in SMB format, we started Wrapped 2020, building off the work left from the Wrapped 2019 campaign. The architecture was meant to be reusable and was a great place to start. However, the source of data was a large, expensive Bigtable cluster that had to be scaled further up to handle the load of Wrapped jobs. We wanted to save cost and time by moving from Bigtable to SMB sources. This year we also needed to handle new complex requirements for filtering and aggregating streams. This required us to join a large dataset containing stream contextual information to the user’s listening history. This would have been nearly impossible or at the very least extremely expensive because of the considerable size of each of these joins. Instead we tried using SMB to eliminate that join completely and avoid using Bigtable as our listening history source.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo compute Wrapped 2020, we had to read from three main data sources for streaming activity, user metadata and streaming context. These three sources had all the data we needed to generate each person’s Wrapped while filtering based on listening context. Previously, the Bigtable had 5 years’ worth of listening history already keyed by user_id. Now, we are able to read data already keyed by user_id from these three sources through SMB. We then aggregated a year’s worth of data per key to calculate each user’s Wrapped.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause 1 of the 3 main sources are partitioned hourly while the other 2 are partitioned daily, it would be problematic to read a year’s worth of data in one job due to the excessive number of concurrent reads from the hourly partitioned source. Instead, we first ran smaller jobs that would aggregate a week’s or day’s worth of play counts, msPlayed, and other information on each user.

A key point of flexibility here is that the aggregate job can take any mix of weekly and daily partitions, which is incredibly helpful logistically when running these jobs. The end result in practice looks something like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"218\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image6-700x218.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image6-700x218.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image6-250x78.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image6-768x240.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image6-1536x479.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image6-120x37.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2021/02/image6.png 1692w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis ended up being a huge cost savings for us in this year’s Wrapped project. By leveraging SMB, we managed to join roughly a total of 1PB data without using conventional shuffle or Bigtable. We estimate around a 50% decrease in Dataflow costs this year compared to previous years’ Bigtable-based approach. Additionally, we avoided scaling the Bigtable cluster up two to three times its normal capacity (up to around 1,500 nodes at peak) to support the heavy Wrapped jobs. This was a huge win in this year’s campaign as we were able to bring a wonderful experience in a more cost effective way than ever before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBy adopting SMB, we were able to perform extremely large joins that were previously either unfeasible or cost-prohibitive, or that required custom workarounds like Bigtable.

Are your build times improving or regressing? Which version of Xcode is slowest? Which hardware setup is fastest? XCMetrics makes it easy to find out all this and more. Made for iOS engineers, by iOS engineers, the tool is written completely in Swift, so it’s easy to customize. Use it to track the metrics you want — and get insights that can help improve both developer experience and productivity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe problem: Where do you get good Xcode build data?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ve read before on this blog about how our infrastructure teams are always finding new and innovative ways to make \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/07/22/leveraging-mobile-infrastructure-with-data-driven-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003edata-driven decisions\u003c/a\u003e. But what if you don’t have access to good data in the first place? This is especially challenging for iOS engineers given that most of that platform’s tools are closed source, making it especially tricky to customize them to your needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, when we first introduced Swift to our music app, a requirement that we set for ourselves was not to worsen the developer experience. One metric for that is build time: is adopting Swift slowing our Xcode build times down or speeding them up? And how do we accurately measure that (without using a stopwatch every time we hit run)?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOur first solution: Parse the data from Xcode’s log files\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhenever you run a build in Xcode, whether it’s a test build or a continuous integration build in production, xcodebuild produces a log file called xcactivitylog. Many developers don’t know that this file exists or that it’s useful for inspecting warnings, errors, and other data from past builds, like build times. So, over a year ago we developed and released an open source tool called \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/spotify/XCLogParser\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eXCLogParser\u003c/a\u003e — which parses those xcactivitylog files and makes all that build data more accessible to developers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eXCLogParser was created for a simple purpose: unearth the data buried in Xcode’s build logs and make it more human readable. But one piece of feedback we received from various teams after open sourcing XCLogParser is that it still requires substantial time to build the infrastructure for continuously collecting those build logs and maintaining them over time. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt was time for us to build a more full-featured tool — one that could integrate with a production environment composed of distributed teams, and provide better insights over time. A collector and a tracker, not just a parser. And that’s how XCMetrics was born.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA complete solution: Collect, parse, store, track, repeat\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve been developing and testing XCMetrics over the last year, building a whole suite of tools in order to create a complete solution for tracking Xcode build metrics. \u003cstrong\u003eSince introducing this system at Spotify, the tools have been used to collect over one million builds and billions of compilation steps — producing over 10TB of data. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWith this amount of data, we’ve been able to answer complex questions for our developer teams, such as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhich function takes the longest to typecheck in our project every day? \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhich pull requests introduce a specific warning or compilation failure?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow should we configure our engineers’ machines in order to maximize their productivity (hardware specs, installed software, etc.)?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe’ve used these insights to improve the everyday experience and productivity of our developers, and we think other organizations will find these kinds of insights valuable, as well. So we are happy to open source XCMetrics with the world — we’re especially excited to see and learn from the insights other teams uncover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eArchitectural overview: Designed for scale and customization\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eXCMetrics is an all-in-one tool that tracks Xcode build metrics for teams of all sizes.

Spotify Lite started as an experiment that had to be proven, both from a technical and a product-market fit perspective. In 2017, we found that a significant portion of registrations in some of our fastest-growing markets were happening on Android devices much older than what we were used to seeing in North American and European markets. Because of storage constraints, many of our potential users couldn’t install Spotify, and the ones that could weren’t getting the full “Spotify experience”.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur mission was clear: we needed to make Spotify accessible to users with constrained resources, i.e., unreliable networks or phones with limited storage, memory, and low-resolution screens. Now we needed a team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA flexible, Lite team\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe main Spotify Music Android client is divided into multiple features, all owned by separate teams. But for Spotify Lite, we formed a single, autonomous team to fully own the entire process of designing, developing, and releasing the app. This allowed us to roll out an MVP product in record time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore building the new app, the Spotify Lite team — a cross-functional mix of insights, design, product, and engineering — travelled to a number of locations where Lite would be available in order to experience the network and device constraints firsthand. It was absolutely critical to design Spotify Lite with our users in mind, and to experiment and iterate on the streaming experience for cases when devices have poor connectivity or are completely offline. Only then were we able to come up with an optimal, performant solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt should be noted that we wouldn’t have achieved success had it not been for the existing tooling that we were able to reuse — tools for enabling recommendations, playback, search, browsing, and instrumentation. We were building on all the work, experience, and knowledge that came before us, giving us the ability to focus on finding solutions for our users.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eSpotify Lite: Spotify’s first separate app\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eCreating a more performant and smaller version of the Spotify app proved to be more challenging than we liked, as the codebase hadn’t been modularized. With these challenges in mind, we decided to build a new separate app from scratch, giving us the ability to quickly iterate, obtain feedback, and innovate freely.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSpotify Lite was initially built on an entirely different playback stack than the regular Android app. This allowed Lite to be as small as possible, with minimal memory and network data usage. Having a separate app enabled us to test new performance ideas and to gain insights, such as understanding how application size impacts the new user funnel. We no longer use the initial playback stack, and have evolved towards a tailored setup that guarantees stability and playback quality on unreliable networks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBuilding Lite was a lot like packing a backpack for your travels. With limited space, you have to be selective in what you bring. Only the most crucial and necessary components were carried forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA balancing act\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eShrinking the original Spotify app to create Spotify Lite brought up two crucial questions: What key elements of the original Spotify should remain intact to ensure listeners still get the “Spotify experience”? And what sacrifices do we need to make to ensure Spotify Lite does, in fact, remain light? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn answering the first question, we knew that keeping the brand look and feel was absolutely critical to giving listeners a Spotify they could recognize. So, we used the same design philosophy as the original Spotify Android app. However, given a range of constraints (smaller screens, quick/performant interactions), we had to adapt some of our design choices. For example, information density has to be reviewed with smaller screen sizes and lower resolutions in mind, as well as whether information is still readable on a broken or scratched screen (these phones have been around for a while!). We’ve recently added our heuristics for how to design for these constraints to the overall design strategy so that this is kept in mind for other apps and surfaces, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"444\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-700x444.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-700x444.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-250x159.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-768x487.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-1536x975.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-2048x1300.png 2048w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/12/Spotify-Lite_Iphone-Mockups-01-120x76.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlong with streamlining the design, we also had to shrink things down under the hood. The team put a lot of work into implementing all the known techniques for binary size reduction, as well as making tradeoffs when selecting features. As the app includes a native shared library for playback, we have experimented with many compiler and linker flags to prioritize a small app size. This includes, for instance, switching to the \u003cem\u003elld\u003c/em\u003e linker, employing link time code optimizations, and disabling certain language features like RTTI. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOn the Android side, it was the use of App Bundles for application publishing, optimizing our R8 shrinking, carefully choosing dependency libraries, and stripping unused translations. We made an effort to reduce the install size, too. We store the shared library unpacked in the APK without copying it to the install folder, and allow users to store both the app and its cache and downloads separately on the SD card.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAfter the initial larger gains, it became harder and harder to reduce the app size. It was a constant balance between keeping it small while adding additional requested features. Along with monitoring the app download and install sizes in the Google Play Store, we added checks to our continuous delivery pipelines to prevent size bloat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eLite is different\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause Lite was a brand-new concept, some of our work went beyond the app itself, leading to improvements to Spotify systems that other teams could benefit from, too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore Lite, developers could safely assume there was only one Spotify app for any given platform — the Android platform and the Android app were considered one and the same. Backend services — including those providing application views and deciding which features are enabled — were built with that assumption in mind. Some of these assumptions cascaded through many different parts of our internal systems. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we added Lite to the mix, developers needed to know exactly which app a user was using, not just what platform they were on. We generalized that issue beyond our own app and built ways to identify all the apps in the Spotify ecosystem. That work paid off again each time anyone introduced a new Spotify app to the Android platform, including our sister apps \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/kids/?utm_source=us-en_brand_contextual_text\u0026amp;utm_medium=paidsearch\u0026amp;utm_campaign=alwayson_ucanz_us_premiumbusiness_kids_brand+contextual-desktop+text+exact+us-en+google\u0026amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA8Jf-BRB-EiwAWDtEGnamKsxw1Yx_w3KgzFDyJ1g4NKVvIUkc9jRA8fBFdlHCkR8pD4iHmBoCMLAQAvD_BwE\u0026amp;gclsrc=aw.ds\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpotify Kids\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/stations/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSpotify Stations\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://spotify-everywhere.com/collections/car-audio/products/polestar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eAndroid Automotive\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe also had to redesign parts of Spotify’s playback library with Lite constraints in mind — taking into account smaller download and installation sizes, memory usage, and the reduced feature set. Similar considerations have been applied to Spotify’s music and image transcoding services.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eMaking Lite a big deal\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOur ambition is to be the best-in-class Lite app. We are constantly modifying and updating the app to adapt to our users and their ever-evolving needs. As we’ve seen positive adoption of Spotify Lite since launch, we’ve invested in performance improvements, quality, and resilience. We recently rolled out an overhaul of our client architecture to cater to our growing user base and to reduce playback latencies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe birth of Spotify Lite has given us flexible solutions that our other apps have benefited from. One such example is our backend service that scales down images to use less network traffic. Another is the support for App Bundles, which has allowed us to reduce the app size significantly so that users only download the assets needed for their particular device. Creating a separate app was a first for our build system — one that laid the groundwork for building native dependencies, sharing code components, and setting up crash and ANR reporting for tracking app quality.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe are continuing our work to lower the barrier for people to access Spotify. We have our backlog full of ideas and performance improvements we want to keep investing in, not only for Lite but also for our other apps to benefit from.\u003c/p\u003e\n        \u003cbr/\u003e\n\n        \n        \n\n        \n\n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

What exactly is Klio and what does it do? Let’s start with the problem of audio itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eAudio is hard \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eReally, sound is just wiggly air. At a basic level, every violin concerto, love song, dog bark, and knock-knock joke is the result of air compressing and vibrating, which we sense as it moves bones and hair in our ears. Sound is an invisible force that reaches us in ways that we can’t see, but can feel. And that’s what also makes audio so difficult for machines to parse: Humans can tell the difference between a swooning vocal, a danceable beat, and a buzzing bee. Can we teach machines to hear those differences, too? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMachine listening, the field of research focused on getting computers to understand audio, combines expertise and methods from signal processing, music information retrieval, and machine learning — so that all those vibrations in the air result in data that makes a bit more sense for an engineer to work with. When encoded, compressed, and stored on a computer, you’re left with ones and zeroes packed into relatively large binary files. At a glance, a guitar solo can look just like a yodel. So, how do we begin to make sense of it all? And at scale?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Klio_Blog-Images_10-22_01-Which-is-which-01-1.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"525\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eOne is a \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/71mvGXupfKcmO6jlmOJQTP?si=6vu_5jg7TUaxQmySGfzliA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003epopular podcast\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e, one is \u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/3Zb3SXZdtyNA0Cdq0DWLeC\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eacoustic guitar\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e.

We’re adding about 40,000 songs a day and are processing our music catalog — about 60 million songs — on a regular basis, with multiple teams around the world doing work at the same time. Besides the problem of engineering that kind of scale and parallelization, we also wanted a way to tie the processing jobs more closely with the work our audio and ML research teams were doing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe were already building sophisticated data pipelines that supported AI and ML jobs using \u003ca href=\"https://spotify.github.io/scio\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eScio\u003c/a\u003e, a precursor to Klio.

By tying together large database queries, map-filter-reduce operations, natural language processing, and ML models, teams could create better, more personalized playlists, like Discover Weekly, Release Radar, and dozens of others. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, Scio created a platform for processing massive amounts of data about the audio. But what about processing the audio itself? \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eA uniquely Spotify problem, a uniquely Spotify solution\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhile processing metadata for the libraries of 299+ million users is impressive, it’s not the same as processing the content itself — those tens of millions of binary audio files that Spotify hosts and serves all over the world. On top of that, Java-based languages weren’t interfacing well with our Python-based research tools for audio and ML.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe knew that if we could build data pipelines that supported large-scale audio processing, there were untold features and personalizations waiting to be unlocked. We just needed a framework that supported it — and that worked as well with our research tools as our engineering tools. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2019, an ad hoc team of data engineers, ML researchers, and audio experts outlined the requirements for creating a framework designed especially for processing media. Scio was a model of success, but still just a starting point.

Let’s dig into that last requirement first.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eResearchers, engineers, and Python: The importance of speaking a common language\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAround this time, we noticed that both our researchers and engineers were beginning to get a little tired of the roadblocks preventing their audio work from getting adopted. Audio researchers were making promising breakthroughs, but the cost of getting new approaches integrated into shipping products was becoming increasingly high. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs much as their counterparts in data and ML engineering wanted to help, those engineers were spending much of their time looking after several distinct, bespoke systems for production audio processing, all built and customized for individual teams. In other words, we had smart people all over the company working on audio, but our \u003ca href=\"https://research.atspotify.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eworld-class researchers\u003c/a\u003e and engineers couldn’t work together, until most of the research was rewritten by the engineers. And even then, all that work and effort was siloed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe solution was simple: Python. It’s the native language of research and well-suited for the engineering problems at hand. Most importantly, allowing everyone to speak without a translation layer puts everyone in a position to focus on what they excel at. Audio and ML researchers get to focus on experimentation and building cutting-edge research tools. Engineers get to focus on building clean, reliable code.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Klio?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2409\" height=\"1868\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Klio_Blog-Images_10-22_02-What-is-02-B.gif\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKlio is a framework for building smarter data pipelines for audio and other binary files, enabling you to production-ize media processing at scale.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStreamlined Apache Beam\u003c/strong\u003e for a more ergonomic, Python-native experience for researchers and engineers\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOpen graph of job dependencies\u003c/strong\u003e with support for top-down and bottom-up executions\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntegration with cloud processing engines\u003c/strong\u003e for managed resources and autoscaling production pipelines\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eContainerization of custom dependencies\u003c/strong\u003e for simplified development and easily  reproducible deployment\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBatch and streaming pipelines\u003c/strong\u003e for continuous processing\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eApache Beam under the hood, Klio in the driver’s seat\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s no surprise then that Klio is built on top of \u003ca href=\"https://beam.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eApache Beam\u003c/a\u003e for Python, while also aiming to be a more Pythonic experience of Beam. Additionally, Klio offers several advantages over traditional Python Beam for media processing — providing a substantial reduction in boilerplate code (an average of 60%), a focus on heavy file I/O, and standards for connecting multiple streaming jobs together in a jobs dependency graph (with top-down and bottom-up execution). This allows teams to immediately focus on writing new pipelines, with the knowledge that they can easily be extended and connected later. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis ease of use and streamlining of Apache Beam means we can get our state-of-the-art audio research into people’s hands and ears, faster. And while Klio offers this more opinionated way to use Apache Beam for common media processing use cases by default, it also allows the use of core Python Beam at any time if Klio’s opinions don’t fit your use case.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eEfficiency, \u003cs\u003eefficiency,\u003c/s\u003e \u003cs\u003eefficiency\u003c/s\u003e (DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we were developing Klio, we decided to test it by downsampling every track in Spotify’s 60-million song catalog — amounting to well over 100 million audio files in all (including multiple releases of the same song). Downsampling is often the first step of audio analysis, so it’s a great benchmark of what real-world performance might look like. Previously, the fastest we had accomplished this at Spotify was about three or four weeks. With Klio, we did it in six days, and reduced costs by four times. When you think about the number of songs in our catalog, and our quickly growing podcast library, Klio can have a tremendous impact on our teams and our business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Klio_Blog-Images_10-22_03-Before-After-01-2-700x409.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Klio_Blog-Images_10-22_03-Before-After-01-2-700x409.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Klio_Blog-Images_10-22_03-Before-After-01-2-250x146.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Klio_Blog-Images_10-22_03-Before-After-01-2-768x449.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Klio_Blog-Images_10-22_03-Before-After-01-2-1536x898.png 1536w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Klio_Blog-Images_10-22_03-Before-After-01-2-2048x1197.png 2048w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Klio_Blog-Images_10-22_03-Before-After-01-2-120x70.png 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cem\u003eWith Klio’s streamlined framework, pipelines are more efficient and reliable. We can do in days what took weeks. And since jobs don’t have to be repeated (missing dependencies can be recursively created), you don’t have to run files through the whole pipeline again just to apply one more transformation at the end. \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’ll find these kinds of optimizations throughout Klio’s implementation. Klio pipelines improve processing time and costs by avoiding duplicate work on already processed audio. And the framework is opinionated — encouraging engineers and researchers to write a pipeline focused on one thing, like finding the timestamps of all the beats to a song or measuring a song’s loudness. By creating reusable building blocks, Klio allows for researchers to build more easily on top of previous research and create graphs of pipelines, leading to features like infinite playlists optimized for your current mood, internal tools that help automate the review of new content, and powerful data that personalizes the Spotify experience for each user.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eScale, reproducibility, and clouds. No infra team required.\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKlio can be run locally, but it really shines in the cloud — and is ready-made for it. In order to achieve the large-scale processing and reproducibility that we require at Spotify, Klio leverages the best parts of modern cloud infrastructures (like managed resources to autoscale production pipelines) and tooling (like containerization for easier deployments).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKlio was designed to be cloud agnostic, and the underlying Apache Beam project is designed to run workloads across any data workflow engine. Right now, it’s configured to work with Google Cloud Platform, but we welcome \u003ca href=\"https://docs.klio.io/en/latest/contributors.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003econtributions\u003c/a\u003e to help get Klio running on AWS, Azure, or another infrastructure. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOne thing to note: Current limitations to Beam Python prevent all of its features from being used on every engine, but we expect increased compatibility with Apache Flink and Apache Spark as Apache Beam extends its underlying compatibility with these engines. Preliminary work has also been done testing Klio on Amazon AWS and S3 using Klio’s Direct Runner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe think this cloud integration (infrastructure as a service) can unlock production bottlenecks, as well as encourage experimentation. Engineering teams can rely on Klio to standardize media processing — using data processing and monitoring tools they’re already familiar with — rather than creating architectures from the ground up. Klio’s ability to autoscale production pipelines to handle variable workloads lets engineers focus on the next thing, rather than constantly tuning workloads.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFrom Sing Along to dolphin songs: Open and the great unknown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eKlio began as a proof of concept a little less than two years ago. It was invented out of necessity — to overcome challenges we were facing internally. But even from the very beginning, it was built with the intention of being free and open source software. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs we’ve seen with \u003ca href=\"https://backstage.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eBackstage\u003c/a\u003e, our open platform for building developer portals, \u003ca href=\"https://engineering.atspotify.com/2020/09/24/cloud-native-computing-foundation-accepts-backstage-as-a-sandbox-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eSpotify is committed to open source and developer experience\u003c/a\u003e. We want to make the lives of engineers easier, so they can focus on building amazing things. So we’re excited to see not only how Klio can help others and advance audio/media research, but also what we can learn from others’ contributions and how Klio can evolve as a result. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBefore and after Klio, Spotify has been doing this kind of large-scale audio analysis for nearly a decade, extracting and transforming tracks in our catalog on a weekly, daily, and streaming basis. Audio analysis algorithms power our \u003ca href=\"https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eAudio Features API\u003c/a\u003e for fingerprinting songs by their unique attributes (illustrated in this interactive \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/09/opinion/do-songs-of-the-summer-sound-the-same.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eNew York Times\u003c/a\u003e article), in-house tools, like our automated content review screener; and market-specific features, like our Sing Along feature in Japan — which \u003ca href=\"https://research.atspotify.com/making-sense-of-music-by-extracting-and-analyzing-individual-instruments-in-a-song/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eseparates the vocals from the instruments\u003c/a\u003e as songs are uploaded to the catalog to create interactive versions that people can sing along with.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut as we saw when we open sourced Backstage, the open source community will come up with use cases we never dreamed of. And since Klio enables anyone to do this kind of heavy-duty media processing at scale (not just big tech companies), we’re particularly curious to see what academics and research institutions will build with it.

Domains roughly map different surfaces or systems in our service.

For this reason many experiments need to run in an exclusive manner, where a user can only be in one of a set of experiments that can potentially impact each other. Currently only experiments in a single domain can be exclusive to each other. We’re planning to decouple exclusivity from the domain concept, to allow for experiments across domains to also be exclusive to each other. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe implement holdbacks (the practice of exempting a set of users from experiments and new features, in order to see long-term effects and combined evaluation) in domains. Each domain can have a set of holdbacks. Users in these holdbacks are exempt from the general experimentation that happens in the domain. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify we have established a pattern where at the start of a quarter, we create a new holdback. Experiments that run throughout the quarter will never be assigned to any of those users subject to the holdback. When the quarter ends, a single test is run on these users where the combined experience of all (successful) experiments is given to the treatment group. This way we can get a read for the compound effect of everything the team decided to ship during the quarter. Once this test is done, the holdback is released and these users will go into new experiments. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Salt Machine\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt Spotify, autonomous are teams free to move at schedules that fit them best.

Teams generate hypotheses that we test by running experiments — normally in the form of an A/B test — to learn what works and what doesn’t. The learnings give us insights and fuel new product ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWant to know why Spotify decided to build a new Experimentation Platform and how it works? In this two-part series, we’ll share what led us to throw out our old A/B testing platform (called ABBA) and details around the new architecture we’ve chosen to substitute it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eEarly days\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eToday almost all product decisions are made with some input from one or more A/B tests. But it hasn’t always been like that. Back when Spotify was a small startup in Sweden, a team, simply called Analytics, played around with various kinds of tests. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOver time, interest in A/B testing grew, and in 2013 we decided to spin up a team to take on building a more robust system. Thus was born \u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/track/2PzCOP5Aj9SABiBgNEZ52G\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eABBA\u003c/a\u003e, an A/B testing system that allowed us to (more) easily run experiments. Now we had a place to see what A/B tests were actually running, and a pipeline that computed results. The introduction of the system was a step change in productivity, and over time it was integrated into pretty much every aspect of Spotify — in our desktop clients and mobile clients, backend services and data pipelines, in-app messaging, and email campaigns. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eABBA as a system was quite simple. Each experiment (or rollout) mapped one to one to a feature flag, named after the experiment. When a client fetched the value of the feature flag it got back the name of the treatment group — e.g., “Control” or “Enabled” or “Sort according to color” — anything the user decided to name the group. (Fun trivia: some users of ABBA started encoding more elaborate configurations as JSON in the group names. Life finds a way). Every time a feature flag value was resolved, an event was logged, which fed into the exposure and results pipelines. For each experiment, only a small number of metrics were calculated. Many of these metrics were not very sensitive, leading to almost all analysis being performed manually in notebooks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy we decided to build a new system\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAround 2017, the system began to reveal its limitations. We had a few big projects that required a lot of experimentation, and the sentiment at the company was that the system needed to improve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAt a hack week in late 2017, a few senior engineers gathered to sketch out a new system, which aimed to address the following challenges (as well as some others):\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReduce Time:\u003c/strong\u003e The 1-1 mapping between an experiment and the feature flag led to some interesting side effects. If there were a problem with the experiment (and often there were) and it needed to be restarted, we simply couldn’t just … restart it. A new experiment would have to be created, and the software would need to be updated to use the new feature flag. The new system would have to reduce the time it took to complete this cycle.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProduce less events\u003c/strong\u003e: The volume of events that were logged by the A/B testing system had over time grown to almost 25% of our total event volume. This drove up the cost of processing, and the volume of events caused incidents in the event delivery system.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImproved analysis:\u003c/strong\u003e The metrics that ABBA provided out of the box were no way near enough for our analysis needs, and our data scientists were getting tired of performing analyses in notebooks. It was time consuming, and we also didn’t have any consistency across the company when it came to how experiments were analyzed. The new system would have to allow us to add custom metrics and we needed a solid analysis methodology.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSophisticated coordination:\u003c/strong\u003e Over time our needs for how we allocated users to experiments changed, which was done manually by coordinating bucket ranges between teams. This was of course error prone — if someone ended up using the wrong buckets a whole slew of experiments would be impacted; the new system would have to address this.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Experimentation Platform\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe new experimentation system, dubbed “The Experimentation Platform”, is composed of three parts:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRemote Configuration\u003c/strong\u003e – replaces our feature-flagging service.

When the code is built, all properties and their default values are gathered and published via an API to the admin interface together with the ID of the client being built and the version number. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"351\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Experimentation-3-700x351.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Experimentation-3-700x351.png 700w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Experimentation-3-250x125.png 250w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Experimentation-3-768x385.png 768w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Experimentation-3-120x60.png 120w, https://storage.googleapis.com/rnd-atspotify/sites/2/2020/10/Experimentation-3.png 1420w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe default value is critical.

The policy has a set of filtering criteria and a property-value mapping to apply if the filters match. The actual implementation of the policy is a \u003ca href=\"https://facebook.github.io/planout/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ePlanOut\u003c/a\u003e script that the Remote Configuration service executes. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAn important side effect of the fetching of property values is that two events are being logged:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConfig Assigned,\u003c/strong\u003e which lets us know that a user has fetched its values.

This integrated workflow and centralization makes great documentation easy. Easy to create and maintain. And easy to find and use.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCustomize and scale your infrastructure with a growing ecosystems of plugins.\u003c/strong\u003e Every company has their own, homegrown infrastructure — Backstage’s plugin architecture makes it simple to make Backstage a perfect fit for yours. Integrating your custom, proprietary tooling is as simple as building an internal plugin for your installation of Backstage. You can also build open source plugins to share with the community. The open source \u003ca rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://backstage.io/plugins\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eplugin marketplace\u003c/a\u003e for Backstage continues to grow, expanding Backstage’s functionality with each new plugin. It’s like an app store for your infrastructure.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBackstage has already come a long way — and none of these features would be what they are today without contributions from the open source community.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOur commitment to the open source community\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe were excited by the reception Backstage received when we first released it. But we’ve been even more gratified by how the community of contributors has grown since then, as they’ve built new \u003ca href=\"https://backstage.io/plugins\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eplugins\u003c/a\u003e and added new functionality to the core product.

That was intentional. Because even though we’ve been using Backstage internally for years, we wanted the open source version to be developed with input and contributions from the community. And that’s exactly the product that’s going into the CNCF Sandbox today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBackstage’s ability to simplify tooling and standardize engineering practices has attracted interest from other major tech companies, as well as airlines, auto manufacturers, investment firms, and global retailers. We know that Backstage solves a problem — infrastructure complexity — that’s common to a lot of large and growing companies today. But different companies work differently, use particular toolsets, and have unique use cases. By making Backstage open source, we can build it with people working inside a variety of engineering organizations all over the world. It makes for a better product that serves a wider group of users (beyond that of Spotify’s) and their needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThank you to everyone who has already contributed to this project, inside and outside of Spotify.
