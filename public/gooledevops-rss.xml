      <title>Getting Started with Google Cloud Logging Python v3.0.0</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/google-cloud-logging-python-client-library-v3-0-0-release/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce the release of a major update to the Google Cloud Python logging library. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;v3.0.0 makes it even easier for Python developers to send and read logs from Google Cloud, providing real-time insights into what is happening in your application.  If you’re a Python developer working with Google Cloud, now is a great time to try out Cloud Logging!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re unfamiliar with the `google-cloud-logging` library, getting started is simple. First, download the library using pip:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you can set up the client library to work with Python&#39;s built-in `logging` library. Doing this will make it so that all your standard Python log statements will start sending data to Google Cloud:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://googleapis.dev/python/logging/latest/std-lib-integration.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;using the standard Python `logging` interface&lt;/a&gt; for log creation, as demonstrated above. However, if you need access to other &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Logging features&lt;/a&gt; (reading logs, managing &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/export/configure_export_v2&#34;&gt;log sinks&lt;/a&gt;, etc), you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://googleapis.dev/python/logging/latest/direct-lib-usage.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;use `google.cloud.logging` directly&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the main features of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/googleapis/python-logging/blob/eac5e2db83f83b24962524fd9e0d7afa09e2785b/UPGRADING.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;new release&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Support More Cloud Environments&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_jAhSLdi.0999065319990470.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous versions of google-cloud-logging supported only&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/appengine&#34;&gt;App Engine&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Engine&lt;/a&gt;. Users reported that the library would occasionally drop logs on serverless environments like Cloud Run and Cloud Functions. This was because the library would send logs in batches over the network. When a serverless environment would spin down, unsent batches could be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;v3.0.0 fixes this issue by making use of GCP’s built in&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/structured-logging&#34;&gt;structured JSON logging functionality&lt;/a&gt; on supported environments (GKE, Cloud Run, or Cloud Functions). If the library detects it is running on an environment that supports structured logging, it will automatically make use of the new&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/googleapis/python-logging/blob/v3.0.0/google/cloud/logging_v2/handlers/structured_log.py&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;StructuredLogHandler&lt;/a&gt;, which writes logs as JSON strings printed to standard out. Google Cloud’s built-in agents will then parse the logs and deliver them to Cloud Logging, even if the code that produced the logs has spun down. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Structured Logging is more reliable on serverless environments, and it allows us to support all major GCP compute environments in v3.0.0. Still, if you would prefer to send logs over the network as before, you can manually set up the library with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/googleapis/python-logging/blob/d86be6cf83c3f3b91c4fc0b2e0666b0ca1d7e248/google/cloud/logging_v2/handlers/handlers.py#L118&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CloudLoggingHandler&lt;/a&gt; instance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Metadata Autodetection&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;2.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2_om8Pxs0.0999064919990643.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you troubleshoot your application, it can be useful to have as much information about the environment as possible captured in your application logs. `google-cloud-logging` attempts to help in this process by detecting and attaching metadata about your environment to each log message. The following fields are currently supported:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;`&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/MonitoredResource&#34;&gt;resource&lt;/a&gt;`: The Google Cloud resource the log originated from &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;for example, Functions, GKE, or Cloud Run&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;`&lt;a href=&#34;http://httprequest&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;httpRequest&lt;/a&gt;`: Information about an HTTP request in the log’s context&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flask and Django are currently supported&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;`&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry#LogEntrySourceLocation&#34;&gt;sourceLocation&lt;/a&gt;` : File, line, and function names&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry&#34;&gt;trace&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry&#34;&gt;spanId&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry&#34;&gt;traceSampled&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.google.com%2Ftrace&#34;&gt;Cloud Trace&lt;/a&gt; metadata&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supports &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/setup#force-trace&#34;&gt;X-Cloud-Trace-Context&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/#traceparent-header&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;w3c transparent&lt;/a&gt; trace formats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The library will make an attempt to populate this data whenever possible, but any of these fields can also be explicitly set by developers using the library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;JSON Support in Standard Library Integration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;3.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/3_wcTDIdW.0999064519990884.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Logging supports both&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/structured-logging&#34;&gt;string and JSON payloads&lt;/a&gt; for LogEntries, but up until now,&lt;a href=&#34;https://googleapis.dev/python/logging/latest/std-lib-integration.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the Python standard library integration&lt;/a&gt; could only send logs with string payloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In `google-cloud-logging` v3,  you can log JSON data in two ways:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Log a JSON-parsable string:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Pass a `json_fields` dictionary using Python logging&#39;s `extra` argument:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With version v3.0.0, the Google Cloud Logging Python library now supports more compute environments, detects more helpful metadata, and provides more thorough support for JSON logs. Along with these major features, there are also user-experience improvements like a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://googleapis.dev/python/logging/latest/UPGRADING.html#new-logger-log-method-316&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;log method&lt;/a&gt; and more &lt;a href=&#34;https://googleapis.dev/python/logging/latest/UPGRADING.html#more-permissive-arguments-422&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;permissive argument parsing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about the latest release, these changes and others are described in more detail in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://googleapis.dev/python/logging/latest/UPGRADING.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;v3.0.0 Migration Guide&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Introducing Certificate Manager to simplify SaaS scale TLS and certificate management</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/simplify-saas-scale-tls-certificate-management/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to announce the public preview of Certificate Manager and its integration with External HTTPS Load Balancing. Certificate Manager enables you to use External HTTPS Load Balancing with as many certificates or domains as you need. You can bring your own TLS certificates and keys if you have an existing certificate lifecycle management solution you&#39;d like to use with Google Cloud, or enjoy the convenience of our fully Managed TLS offerings.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Extend the security and performance of the Google network to your customers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certificate Manager brings support for multiple certificates per customer. When  coupled with our &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/load-balancing-overview&#34;&gt;global anycast load balancing solution&lt;/a&gt; with automated autoscaling and failover, you now have a powerful platform for building robust SaaS and PaaS offerings. This enables custom domain support for your customers with the lowest latency and the highest level of availability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://il.linkedin.com/in/alonkochba&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alon Kochba&lt;/a&gt;, the head of web performance at website-building service Wix, explained how the new features lighten their workload. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“As a SaaS product, we need to terminate SSL for millions of custom domains and certificates. GCP&#39;s Certificate Manager and External HTTPS Load Balancing lets us do this at the edge, close to the clients, without having to rely on our own custom solution for terminating SSL,” Kochba said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers who switch to External HTTPS Load Balancing can also now protect their SaaS users from &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/armor/docs/adaptive-protection-overview&#34;&gt;denial of service attacks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/architecture/owasp-top-ten-mitigation&#34;&gt;OWASP Top 10 risks&lt;/a&gt;, and other common Web attacks by adopting &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/armor&#34;&gt;Cloud Armor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;DNS authorization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This release also now enables you to provision your Google-managed certificates with DNS-based authorizations and have them ready to use before your load-balancing production environment is fully set up. This will help streamline the migration process to Google Cloud, for example. To create a DNS authorization, use the following command:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This command returns the CNAME record for &lt;code&gt;_acme-challenge.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.example.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that you must &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.devsite.corp.google.com/certificate-manager/docs/certificates#cert-dns-auth&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;add to your DNS configuration&lt;/a&gt; in the DNS zone of the target domain. This CNAME record points to a special Google Cloud domain, e.g.: &#34;&lt;code&gt;534959-1a8a-40cf-90b6-b1f5f8d22517.2.authorize.certificatemanager.goog&lt;/code&gt;” that is used  to verify domain ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you request a certificate based on the above authorization, Cloud Certificate Manager will work with the Certificate Authority automatically to get and later renew your certificate for that domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Wildcard support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;b&gt;DNS-based domain control authorization&lt;/b&gt; also allows us to bring you support for &lt;b&gt;wildcard certificates&lt;/b&gt;. To configure the use of wildcard certificates you first must configure the DNS authorization as we’ve indicated above. Once that has been completed, you can configure the use of a wildcard certificate using the following command. Our example below is for a top-level registered domain and its wildcard subdomains.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Monitoring for Certificate Expiration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another new feature that will be enabled with this product  is the ability to monitor certificate expiration with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/products/operations&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Logging&lt;/a&gt;.  Cloud Logging creates a record of certificate expiration, uses the `&lt;code&gt;certificatemanager.googleapis.com/Project&lt;/code&gt;` monitored resource, and is represented by the following message:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The log message is delivered every hour and contains a sample of the certificates being close to expiry or already expired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pricing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best part is that there’s no additional charge to use the Certificate Manager for the first 100 certificates. To use more than 100 certificates with the management tools, we will charge on a per-certificate, per-month pricing structure. This empowers you to scale up to as many certificates as you need, and as cost-effectively as possible. The pricing will be enabled when the solution goes to General Availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Certificate Manager pricing.png&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Certificate_Manager_prici.0999064919990490.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is our hope that these &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs/how-it-works&#34;&gt;new features&lt;/a&gt;, combined with the programmability offered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/certificate-manager/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Certificate Manager&lt;/a&gt;, will enable you to simplify the way you deploy HTTPS and offer a more scalable and secure service to your customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/identity-security/10-questions-to-help-boards-safely-maximize-cloud-opportunities/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/cybersecurity_action_team_jl2RU0c.max-500x500.jpg&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;10 questions to help boards safely maximize cloud opportunities&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;These 10 questions from a new Google Cloud whitepaper will help boards of directors safely guide their organizations through cloud migrat...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

      <title>Google Cloud Deploy, now GA, makes it easier to do continuous delivery to GKE</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/google-cloud-deploy-now-ga/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective software delivery — usually achieved via continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) — is a top priority for many product development teams. It’s easy to understand why: the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops&#34;&gt;2021 State of DevOps report&lt;/a&gt; found that elite performers of software delivery deployed code much more frequently than low performers, with three times fewer change-related failures. Teams who excel at modern software delivery operational practices were also 1.8 times more likely to report better business outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need great tools to do software delivery effectively. Without capable tooling, teams have to design, maintain, and scale their software delivery solutions on their own, which can be difficult given the breadth of continuous delivery’s flow control, security and audit, and integration requirements. Deploying container image artifacts adds further complexity, particularly in Kubernetes environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_cloud_deploy.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;1 cloud deploy.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_cloud_deploy.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building on your feedback and Google’s own best practices, we’ve been working on software delivery tooling that helps you meet your continuous delivery goals — especially with respect to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)&lt;/a&gt; environments. Today, we are pleased to announce the general availability of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt;, a managed, opinionated continuous delivery service that makes continuous delivery to GKE easier, faster, and more reliable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solving for continuous delivery challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While designing Google Cloud Deploy, we talked to a number of customers to better understand the challenges they face doing continuous delivery to GKE. While a handful of themes emerged, three stood out: cost of ownership, security and audit, and measurement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost of ownership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As shared in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/google-cloud-deploy-automates-deploys-to-gke&#34;&gt;Preview launch post&lt;/a&gt; this past September, the operational cost of Kubernetes continuous delivery can be very high. Identifying best and repeatable practices, scaling delivery tooling and pipelines, collecting key metrics, and staying current — to say nothing of maintenance — is resource-intensive and takes time away from the core business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a managed service, Google Cloud Deploy eliminates the scaling and maintenance responsibilities that typically come with self-managed continuous delivery solutions. Now you can reclaim the time spent maintaining your continuous delivery tooling and spend it delivering value to your customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy also provides structure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#delivery_pipeline&#34;&gt;Delivery pipelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology&#34;&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; are defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/config-files&#34;&gt;declaratively&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/pipeline-instances&#34;&gt;retained with each release&lt;/a&gt;. That means if your delivery pipeline changes, the release’s path to production remains durable. No more time lost troubleshooting issues on in-flight releases caused by changes made to the delivery pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;4 Delivery pipeline metrics.gif&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/4_Delivery_pipeline_metrics.gif&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Promoting a release&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you already have a continuous delivery capability, you likely already have continuous integration, approval and/or operation workflows, and other systems that intersect with your software delivery practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating&#34;&gt;embraces the GKE delivery tooling ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; in three ways: &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating-ci&#34;&gt;connectivity to CI systems&lt;/a&gt;, support for leading configuration (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#render&#34;&gt;rendering&lt;/a&gt;) tooling, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub&#34;&gt;Pub/Sub&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/subscribe-deploy-notifications&#34;&gt;notifications&lt;/a&gt; to enable &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating&#34;&gt;related software delivery tooling&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“While looking for a Continuous Delivery solution we considered ArgoCD and Spinnaker, however we chose Google Cloud Deploy because it is a managed service, provided proper CD primitives and integrated seamlessly with our GKE clusters. It has empowered every team member to safely and reliably promote their code from commit all the way through to production.”—Jonathan Sokolowski, DevOps Engineer, Search.io&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A variety of GKE roles and personas interact with continuous delivery processes. DevOps engineers are focused on release promotion and rollback decisions, while a business decision maker thinks about delivery pipeline health and velocity. Google Cloud Deploy’s user experience keeps these multiple perspectives in mind, making it easier for various personas to perform contextualized reviews and make decisions, improving efficiency and reducing cost of ownership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;3 Deployment approvals.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/3_Deployment_approvals.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deployment approvals&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security and control&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy’s security foundations strengthen secure software supply chain practices through delivery flow control and auditability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of different users interact with a software delivery system, making a variety of decisions. Not all users and decisions carry the same authority, however. Being able to define a delivery pipeline and make updates doesn’t always mean you can create release candidates, for example, nor does being able to promote a release to staging mean you can approve it to production. Modern continuous delivery is full of security and audit considerations. Restricting who can access what, where, and how is necessary to maintain release integrity and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Google Cloud Deploy enables fine-grained &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/iam-roles-permissions&#34;&gt;restriction through IAM&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/securing/iam&#34;&gt;discrete access control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/execution-environment&#34;&gt;execution-level security&lt;/a&gt;. Google Cloud Deploy also supports &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/execution-environment#deploying_to_a_private_cluster_on_a_network&#34;&gt;deploying to private GKE clusters&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/supported-products#table_deploy&#34;&gt;Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Service Controls&lt;/a&gt; (currently in Beta) to respect security perimeters. For safeguards against unwanted approvals, you can take advantage of flow management features such as release &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploying-application#promoting_a_release&#34;&gt;promotion&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/managing-delivery-pipeline#rolling_back_a_deployment&#34;&gt;rollback&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/managing-delivery-pipeline#requiring_approval&#34;&gt;approvals&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auditing with Google Cloud Deploy works just like it does for other Google Cloud services. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/audit-logs&#34;&gt;Cloud Audit Logs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/audit-logs&#34;&gt;audits&lt;/a&gt; user-invoked Google Cloud Deploy activities, providing centralized awareness into who promoted a specific release or made an update to a delivery pipeline. You can also create Google Cloud Deploy pipelines in &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/regions&#34;&gt;supported locations&lt;/a&gt; to better conform with your business needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Measurement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great tooling is only part of an effective software delivery strategy — you also need to know what metrics you need to measure, how, and why. By making it easier to measure software delivery performance, Google Cloud Deploy helps teams focus on software delivery optimization and achieve their desired business outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy collects and makes available &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/metrics&#34;&gt;built in metrics&lt;/a&gt; about delivery pipelines. These include deployment history and success, and also the DORA metric ‘deployment frequency.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;2 Promoting a release.gif&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/2_Promoting_a_release.gif&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Delivery pipeline metrics&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitoring your deployed resources is another way to measure the effectiveness of your software delivery processes. To aid monitoring, Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/labels-annotations#automatic_labels_from&#34;&gt;automatically labels deployed Kubernetes resources&lt;/a&gt;, making it easier to associate  your delivery pipelines with application performance. You can integrate application monitoring further using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/api/reference/rest&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Deploy API&lt;/a&gt;, so you can automatically promote code if it is stable and roll it back if an anomaly is detected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive, easy-to-use, and cost-effective DevOps tools are key to building an efficient software development team, and it’s our hope that Google Cloud Deploy will help you implement complete CI/CD pipelines. And we’re just getting started!

      <title>DevOps for tech companies and startups: Learn from over 32,000 professionals on how to drive success with Google Cloud’s DORA research</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/implementing-google-cloud-devops-for-your-cloud-native-organization/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many technology-driven organizations and startups use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops&#34;&gt;DevOps&lt;/a&gt; as a business enabler, allowing them to bring ideas to market quickly, increase developer productivity, and increase their customer base. Adopting DevOps workflows can drive success but many companies continue to struggle with how to get started or optimize the DevOps tools they currently have incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud’s DevOps Research and Assessment (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops&#34;&gt;DORA&lt;/a&gt;) team helps organizations to deploy faster, scale on demand, and balance costs by providing essential tools and resources for you to succeed. Over the past seven years, our DORA team has surveyed more than 32,000 professionals worldwide via our yearly &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops&#34;&gt;Accelerate State of DevOps reports&lt;/a&gt; (SODR). As the largest and longest-running research of its kind, the SODR provides data-driven industry insights that examine the capabilities and practices that drive software delivery and operational and organizational performance - no matter the industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read below to learn more from our DORA team about how and why your organization should focus on DevOps this year: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Benchmark your team, identify improvement opportunities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&#34;https://inthecloud.withgoogle.com/devops-quick-check/dl-cd.html?utm_source=google_owned_website&amp;amp;utm_medium=et&amp;amp;utm_campaign=FY20-Q3-global-demandgen-website-other-gcp_gtm_cost_amp_devops_quick_check_mc&amp;amp;utm_content=app_mod_lp_cta&amp;amp;utm_term=-&amp;amp;_ga=2.131280267.562104682.1627912649-1057981864.1627522111&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DevOps Quick Check&lt;/a&gt; is based on DORA research and allows companies to gauge their DevOps implementation with just five multiple choice questions. The DevOps Quick Check uses the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance&#34;&gt;four key DevOps metrics&lt;/a&gt; to help your team assess your current performance, compare your performance to others in your industry, and identify which capabilities are most likely to impact your performance. Teams in every industry recognize the value of quickly taking code from development to production and are looking for ways to improve their organizations&#39; agility. Compromising stability is not an option. The data from the research program shows that speed and stability go hand-in-hand, in fact elite performing teams are nearly twice as likely to have increased software delivery performance and achieve 6570x faster lead-time-to-deploy changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Increasing developer productivity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with driving software delivery performance, DevOps helps to increase developer productivity by reducing burnout - something that is a top priority for many organizations. According to the SODR, 89% of respondents worked from home during the pandemic but teams with a&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture&#34;&gt;generative team culture,&lt;/a&gt; with people who had feelings of inclusion and belonging within their team, were half as likely to experience burnout. A generative culture along with easy to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-teams-empowered-to-choose-tools&#34;&gt;developer tools&lt;/a&gt;help to streamline developers’ workflows and the process of working with cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developer tools that keep developers focused on what they do best, writing code,  is vital to increase developer productivity. Companies should utilize tools that ensure developers spend as little time as possible containerizing applications while increasing automation are paramount. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We commonly see developers leverage &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt; to bring modern applications to life, and there are many benefits of doing so, especially in terms of portability. However, using Docker increases the operational burden on developers. Whereas those that leverage &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suhCr5W_bFc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Buildpacks&lt;/a&gt; are able to reduce operational burden while supporting enterprise operators who manage apps at scale. They are able to do this because Buildpacks allows code to go straight from source to production, in addition to making it easier to meet security and compliance requirements without developer intervention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus when developers want to speed up the deployment process with flexibility they have the option to leverage &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/run&#34;&gt;Cloud Run&lt;/a&gt;, our fully managed serverless platform offering, which fully supports the use of Buildpacks. Below are some benefits developers and operators can see from Cloud Run:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Increased Productivity&lt;/b&gt;: make it easier for developers to onboard more quickly and deploy faster &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hiring&lt;/i&gt;: choose a platform that makes all developers productive. Serverless platforms, like Cloud Run, help developers who know fewer programming languages become  productive without the need to also be an IT expert &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decreased Time to Market&lt;/b&gt;: accelerate software releases and value creation to customers that ultimately increase revenue and customer loyalty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decreased Cost&lt;/b&gt;: Cloud Run abstracts away all infrastructure management by automatically scaling up and down from zero almost instantaneously - so you only pay for what you use&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you choose Cloud Run or another offering - it’s not just which cloud infrastructure you choose, but how you implement cloud services that really matters. This is especially important when it comes to being able to scale quickly and efficiently. In the SODR, we found that Elite performers were 3.5 times more likely to have met all essential &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-cloud-infrastructure&#34;&gt;NIST cloud characteristics&lt;/a&gt;. In terms of scaling, the characteristic of rapid elasticity is key to rapidly scaling outward or inward with demand. In other words, it is very important that your capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released - so no matter how much you grow, your customers always have access to your services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Business Case for DevOps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&#39;re convinced that achieving better speed and stability will help your team but how do you convince your boss?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/resources/roi-of-devops-transformation-whitepaper&#34;&gt;ROI of DevOps Transformation&lt;/a&gt; provides IT and business decision makers an industry backed, data-driven foundational basis for measuring their investment in DevOps. We found that money saved from DevOps transformation varies from $10M to $259M a year with a return on investment of approximately 30 days. You can use the metrics you provided in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devops-research.com/quickcheck.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DevOps Quick Check&lt;/a&gt; along with some additional information to get an estimate on your team&#39;s potential return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Google Cloud DevOps Awards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a collection of these resources along with an objective assessment of how your team is doing, your organization will be able to get quick insights into improvement areas. Change your work by improving these capabilities to deliver more innovation to your customers and improve the speed and stability of your software delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have shared some of our DevOps best practices with you, we would love to hear about how you are transforming your organization with DevOps. During our awards celebration in March we will be celebrating how our most advanced teams are using DevOps, so tell us about the positive impact that DevOps has had on your teams, customers, and organization. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/awards/devops&#34;&gt;Enter your submission for the Google Cloud DevOps Awards&lt;/a&gt; today.

Teams in every industry recognize the value of quickly taking code from development to production and are looking for ways to improve their organizations&#39; agility. Compromising stability is not an option. The data from the research program shows that speed and stability go hand-in-hand, in fact elite performing teams are nearly twice as likely to have increased software delivery performance and achieve 6570x faster lead-time-to-deploy changes.</p><h3>Increasing developer productivity</h3><p>Along with driving software delivery performance, DevOps helps to increase developer productivity by reducing burnout - something that is a top priority for many organizations. According to the SODR, 89% of respondents worked from home during the pandemic but teams with a<a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture" track-type="inline link" track-name="6" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture" track-metadata-module="post"> generative team culture,</a> with people who had feelings of inclusion and belonging within their team, were half as likely to experience burnout. A generative culture along with easy to use <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-teams-empowered-to-choose-tools" track-type="inline link" track-name="7" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-teams-empowered-to-choose-tools" track-metadata-module="post">developer tools </a>help to streamline developers’ workflows and the process of working with cloud infrastructure.</p><p>Developer tools that keep developers focused on what they do best, writing code,  is vital to increase developer productivity. Companies should utilize tools that ensure developers spend as little time as possible containerizing applications while increasing automation are paramount. </p><p>We commonly see developers leverage <a href="https://docs.docker.com/" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="8" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://docs.docker.com" track-metadata-module="post">Docker</a> to bring modern applications to life, and there are many benefits of doing so, especially in terms of portability. However, using Docker increases the operational burden on developers. Whereas those that leverage <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suhCr5W_bFc" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="9" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://www.youtube.com" track-metadata-module="post">Buildpacks</a> are able to reduce operational burden while supporting enterprise operators who manage apps at scale. They are able to do this because Buildpacks allows code to go straight from source to production, in addition to making it easier to meet security and compliance requirements without developer intervention. </p><p>Plus when developers want to speed up the deployment process with flexibility they have the option to leverage <a href="https://cloud.google.com/run" track-type="inline link" track-name="10" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://cloud.google.com/run" track-metadata-module="post">Cloud Run</a>, our fully managed serverless platform offering, which fully supports the use of Buildpacks. Below are some benefits developers and operators can see from Cloud Run:</p><ol><li><p><b>Increased Productivity</b>: make it easier for developers to onboard more quickly and deploy faster </p></li><ul><li><i>Hiring</i>: choose a platform that makes all developers productive. Serverless platforms, like Cloud Run, help developers who know fewer programming languages become  productive without the need to also be an IT expert </li></ul><li><p><b>Decreased Time to Market</b>: accelerate software releases and value creation to customers that ultimately increase revenue and customer loyalty</p></li><li><p><b>Decreased Cost</b>: Cloud Run abstracts away all infrastructure management by automatically scaling up and down from zero almost instantaneously - so you only pay for what you use</p></li></ol><p>Whether you choose Cloud Run or another offering - it’s not just which cloud infrastructure you choose, but how you implement cloud services that really matters. This is especially important when it comes to being able to scale quickly and efficiently. In the SODR, we found that Elite performers were 3.5 times more likely to have met all essential <a href="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-cloud-infrastructure" track-type="inline link" track-name="11" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-cloud-infrastructure" track-metadata-module="post">NIST cloud characteristics</a>. In terms of scaling, the characteristic of rapid elasticity is key to rapidly scaling outward or inward with demand. In other words, it is very important that your capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released - so no matter how much you grow, your customers always have access to your services. </p><h3>The Business Case for DevOps</h3><p>Maybe you&#39;re convinced that achieving better speed and stability will help your team but how do you convince your boss?</p><p>The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resources/roi-of-devops-transformation-whitepaper" track-type="inline link" track-name="12" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://cloud.google.com/resources/roi-of-devops-transformation-whitepaper" track-metadata-module="post">ROI of DevOps Transformation</a> provides IT and business decision makers an industry backed, data-driven foundational basis for measuring their investment in DevOps. We found that money saved from DevOps transformation varies from $10M to $259M a year with a return on investment of approximately 30 days.

      <title>Understanding Firestore performance with Key Visualizer</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/understanding-firestore-performance-with-key-visualizer/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cloud/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/all-you-need-know-about-firestore-cheatsheet&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Firestore&lt;/a&gt; is a serverless, scalable, NoSQL document database. It is ideal for rapid and flexible web and mobile application development, and uniquely supports real-time client device syncing to the database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the best performance out of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/firestore&#34;&gt;Firestore&lt;/a&gt;, while also making the most out of Firestore&#39;s automatic scaling and load balancing features, you need to make sure the data layout of your application allows requests to be processed optimally, particularly as your user traffic increases. There are some subtleties to be aware of when it comes to what could happen when traffic ramps up, and to help make this easier to identify, we’re announcing the General Availability of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/key-visualizer&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key Visualizer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an interactive, performance monitoring tool for Firestore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Visualizer generates visual reports based on Firestore documents accessed over time, that will help you understand and optimize the access patterns of your database, as well as troubleshoot performance issues. With Key Visualizer, you can iteratively design a data model or improve your existing application’s data usage pattern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tip: While Key Visualizer can be used with production databases, it’s best to identify performance issues prior to rolling out changes in production. Consider running application load tests with Firestore in a pre-production environment, and using Key Visualizer to identify potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Viewing a visualization&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Key Visualizer tool is available to all Firestore customers. Visualizations are generated at every hour boundary, covering data for the preceding two hours. Visualizations are generated as long as overall database traffic during a selected period meets the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/key-visualizer#scan_eligibility&#34;&gt;scan eligibility&lt;/a&gt; criteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get an overview of activity using Key Visualizer, first select a two-hour time period and review the heatmap for the &#34;Total ops/s&#34; metric. This view estimates the number of operations per second and how they are distributed across your database. Total ops/s is an estimated sum of write, lookup, and query operations averaged by seconds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firestore automatically scales using a technique called range sharding. When using Firestore, you model data in the form of documents stored in hierarchies of collections. The collection hierarchy and document ID is translated to a single key for each document. Documents are logically stored and ordered lexicographically by this key. We use the term &#34;key range&#34; to refer to a range of keys. The full key range is then automatically split up as-needed, driven by storage and traffic load, and served by many replicated servers inside of Firestore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following example of Key Visualizer visualization shows a heatmap where there are some major differences in the usage pattern across the database. The X-axis is time, and the Y-axis is the key range for your database, broken down into buckets by traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranges shown in dark colors have little or no activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ranges in bright colors have significantly more activity. In the example below, you can see the &#34;Bar&#34; and &#34;Qux&#34; collections going beyond 50 operations per second for some period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;1 Firestore.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_Firestore.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional methods of interpreting Key Visualizer visualizations are detailed in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/keyvis-patterns&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the total number of operations, Key Visualizer also provides views with metrics for ops per second, average latency, and tail latency, where traffic is broken down for writes and deletes, lookups, and queries. This capability allows you to identify issues with your data layout or poorly balanced traffic that may be contributing to increased latencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Hotspots and heatmap patterns&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Visualizer gives you insight into how your traffic is distributed, and lets you understand if latency increases correlate with a hotspot, thus providing you with information to determine what parts of your application need to change. We refer to a &#34;hotspot&#34; as a case where traffic is poorly balanced across the database&#39;s keyspace. For the best performance, requests should be distributed evenly across a keyspace. The effect of a hotspot can vary, but typically hotspotting causes higher latency and in some cases, even failed operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firestore automatically splits a key range into smaller pieces and distributes the work of serving traffic to more servers when needed. However, this has some limitations. Splitting storage and load takes time, and ramping up traffic too fast may cause hotspots while the service adjusts. The best practice is to distribute operations across the key range, while &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/best-practices#ramping_up_traffic&#34;&gt;ramping up traffic&lt;/a&gt; on a cold database with 500 operations per second, and then increasing traffic by up to 50% every 5 minutes. This is called the &#34;500/50/5&#34; rule, and allows you to rapidly warm up a cold database safely. For example, ramping to 1,000,000 ops/s can be achieved in under two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firestore can automatically split a key range until it is serving a single document using a dedicated set of replicated servers. Once this threshold is hit, Firestore is unable to create further splits beyond a single document. As a result, high and sustained volumes of concurrent operations on a single document may result in elevated latencies. You can observe these high latencies using Key Visualizer’s average and tail latency metrics. If you encounter sustained high latencies on a single document, you should consider modifying your data model to split or replicate the data across multiple documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key Visualizer will also help you identify additional traffic patterns:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph_with_image&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--wrap-small &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;2 Firestore.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2_Firestore.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evenly distributed usage&lt;/b&gt;: If a heatmap shows a fine-grained mix of dark and bright colors, then reads and writes are evenly distributed throughout the database. This heatmap represents an effective usage pattern for Firestore, and no additional action is required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph_with_image&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--wrap-small &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;3 Firestore.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/3_Firestore.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sequential Keys&lt;/b&gt;: A heatmap with a single bright diagonal line can indicate a special hotspotting case where the database is using strictly increasing or decreasing keys (document IDs). Sequential keys are an anti-pattern in Firestore, which will result in elevated latency especially at higher operations per second. In this case, the document IDs that are generated and utilized should be randomized. To learn more, see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.devsite.corp.google.com/firestore/docs/best-practices#high_read_write_and_delete_rates_to_a_narrow_document_range&#34;&gt;best practices page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph_with_image&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--wrap-small &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;4 Firestore.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/4_Firestore.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sudden traffic increase&lt;/b&gt;: A heatmap with a key range that suddenly changes from dark to bright indicates a sudden spike in load. If the load increase isn’t well distributed across the key range, and exceeds the 500/50/5 rule best practice, the database can experience elevated latency in the operations. In this case, the data layout should be modified to reflect a better distribution of usage and traffic across the keyspace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Next steps&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firestore Key Visualizer is a performance monitoring tool available to administrators and developers to better understand how their applications interact with Firestore.

The X-axis is time, and the Y-axis is the key range for your database, broken down into buckets by traffic.</p><ul><li><p>Ranges shown in dark colors have little or no activity.</p></li><li><p>Ranges in bright colors have significantly more activity. In the example below, you can see the &#34;Bar&#34; and &#34;Qux&#34; collections going beyond 50 operations per second for some period of time.</p></li></ul></div></paragraph-block></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A cloud built for developers — 2021 year in review</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/a-cloud-built-for-developers-2021-year-in-review/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;2021 was a seminal year for software developers. Every company accelerated their digital and online efforts, while simultaneously moving to remote development. Innovation by driving developer productivity was top of mind for nearly every IT executive we spoke to. Many asked us about Alphabet&#39;s long track record of innovation. From Google search to Waymo’s driverless cars,  is there a secret to developing the next big thing? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple: 10X thinking. Look for solutions that help customers drive 10X improvements, through a series of smaller increments that compound to a large impact over time. At Google Cloud, we follow a similar philosophy to help our customers become innovative technology companies. In recent times, we’ve worked closely with partners, customers, and developers on services that help unlock 10X improvements in developer productivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, we introduced a managed Kubernetes service, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This year, we added &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-gke-autopilot&#34;&gt;GKE Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;, which revolutionized Kubernetes management by eliminating all node management operations. Likewise, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/run&#34;&gt;Cloud Run&lt;/a&gt; serverless platform was the first service of its kind, allowing developers to go beyond running small bits of code and run full applications in a serverless environment. From September 2020 to September 2021, Cloud Run deployments more than quadrupled. More recently, we co-founded the &lt;a href=&#34;https://openssf.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Source Security Foundation&lt;/a&gt; and began working on secure continuous Integration and delivery (CI/CD) services a year or so ahead of the cybersecurity threats that made it to headlines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are the top developer challenges that customers asked us to solve in 2021: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driving distributed developer productivity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Securing the software supply chain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplifying running of cloud-native applications &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on for more insights. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Driving distributed developer productivity&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A critical prerequisite for innovation is time. Investments in developer productivity free developers to work on the important things. Traditionally, developers have spent hours downloading and installing tools to their local environments, updating them with the latest versions, or dependencies. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/editor-overview&#34;&gt;Cloud Shell Editor&lt;/a&gt; is a full remote development environment with a growing set of built in security capabilities. It comes with developer tools pre-installed, including MySql, Kubernetes, Docker, minikube, Skaffold, etc. Developers just needed a web browser and internet connection to be productive. Developers now have access to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/cloud-shell-tutorials/tutorials&#34;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt; right from Cloud Shell Editor, and can try code samples directly in &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/run-code-samples-directly-google-cloud-documentation&#34;&gt;our documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, with support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/building/containers&#34;&gt;buildpacks&lt;/a&gt;, developers can create container images &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/build-and-deploy-an-app-to-cloud-run-with-a-single-command&#34;&gt;directly from source code&lt;/a&gt;, without knowing anything about docker or containers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Securing the software supply chain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software supply chain vulnerabilities had far reaching consequences in 2021, with events such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/12/17/cyberattacks-cybersecurity-solarwinds-fireeye/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SolarWinds&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mimecast.com/blog/important-update-from-mimecast/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mimecast/Microsoft Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Log4j&lt;/a&gt;affecting businesses, daily life, and entire &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cyberscoop.com/dhs-cyber-alert-subpoena-us/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;governments&lt;/a&gt;. President Biden even issued an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; to strengthen software supply-chain security standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solving the software supply chain problem requires players across industries to work together. This is why we co-founded the&lt;a href=&#34;https://openssf.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Source Security Foundation&lt;/a&gt; (Open SSF).

      <title>Postmortems at Loon: a guiding force for rapid development</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/loon-sre-use-postmortems-to-launch-and-iterate/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Founded by Google SRE alumni, it is no surprise that Loon&#39;s Production Engineering/SRE team instituted a culture of blameless postmortems that became a key feature of Loon&#39;s approach to incident response. Blameless postmortems originated as an aerospace practice in the mid-20th century, so it was particularly fitting that they came full circle to be used at a company that melded cutting edge aerospace work with the development of a communications platform and the world&#39;s first stratospheric temporospatial software defined network. The use of postmortems became a standardizing factor across Loon&#39;s teams— from avionics and manufacturing, to flight operations, to software platforms and network service. This blog post discusses how Loon moved from a heterogeneous approach to postmortems to eventually standardize and share this practice across the organization— a shift that helped the company move from R&amp;amp;D to commercial service in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Postmortems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many industries have adopted the use of postmortems— they are fairly common in high-risk fields where mistakes can be fatal or extremely expensive. Postmortems are also widespread in industries and projects where bad processes or assumptions can incur expensive project development costs and avoiding repeat mistakes is a priority. Individual industries and organizations often develop their own postmortem standards or templates so that postmortems are easier to create and digest across teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blameless postmortems likely originated in the healthcare and aerospace industries in the mid-20th century. Because of the high cost of failure, these industries needed to create a culture of transparency and continuous improvement that could only come from openly discussing failure. As the original SRE book states, blameless postmortems are key to &#34;an environment where every &#39;mistake&#39; is seen as an opportunity to strengthen the system.&#34; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of a postmortem is to document an incident or event in order to foster learning from it, both among the affected teams and beyond. The postmortem usually includes a timeline of what happened, the solutions implemented, the incident&#39;s impact, the investigation into root causes, and changes or follow-ups to stop it from happening again. To facilitate learning, SRE&#39;s postmortem format includes both what went well— acknowledging the successes that should be maintained and expanded— and what went poorly and needs to be changed. In this way, postmortem action items are key to prioritizing work that ensures the same failures don&#39;t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loon aimed to supply internet access to unserved and underserved populations around the world by providing connectivity via stratospheric balloons. These high altitude “flying cell towers” covered a much wider footprint than a terrestrial tower, and could be deployed (and repositioned) into the most remote corners of the earth without expensive overland transportation and installation. As the first company to attempt anything like this, Loon dealt with a number of systems that were complex, challenging, or novel: superpressure balloons designed to stay aloft for hundreds of days, wind-dependant steering, a software defined network consisting of constantly moving nodes, and extremes of temperature and weather at 20km above Earth&#39;s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prod Team&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial high-risk operations of Loon&#39;s mission were avionic: could we launch and steer balloons carrying a networking payload long enough to reach and serve the targeted region? As such, the earliest failure reports within Loon (which weren&#39;t officially called &#34;postmortems&#34; at the time) mostly involved balloon construction or flight, and drew on the experience of team members who had worked in the Avionics, Reliability Engineering, and/or Flight Safety fields. As Loon&#39;s systems evolved and matured, they started to require operational reliability, as well. Just before graduating from a purely R&amp;amp;D project in Google&#39;s &#34;moonshot factory&#34; incubator X to a company with commercial goals, Loon started building a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team known internally as Prod Team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to effectively offer internet connectivity to users, Loon had to solve network serving failures with the same rigor as hardware failures. Prod Team took the lead on a number of practices to improve network reliability. The Prod Team had three primary goals: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that the fleet&#39;s automation, management, and safety-critical systems were built and operated to meet the high safety bar of the aviation industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead the integration of the communications services (e.g., LTE) end to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Own the mission of fielding and providing a reliable commercial service (Loon Library) in the real world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Postmortems at Loon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Early Days&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postmortems were one tool for reaching Prod Team&#39;s (SRE&#39;s) goals. Prod Team often interacted with SREs in other infrastructure support teams that the Loon service connected to, such as the team developing the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), our telco partner counterparts, and teams that handle edge network connectivity. Postmortems provided a common tool for sharing incident information across all these teams, and could even span multiple companies when upstream problems impacted customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Loon, postmortems served the following goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Document and transcribe the events, actions, and remedies related to an incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide a feedback loop to rectify problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicate where to build better safeguards and alerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Break down silos between teams in order to facilitate cross-functional knowledge sharing and accelerate development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify macro themes and blind spots over the longer term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of aerospace and high tech brought two strong practices of writing postmortems, but also the challenge of how to own, investigate, or follow up on problems that crossed those boundaries, or when it wasn&#39;t clear where the system fault lay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loon&#39;s teams across hardware, software, and operations orgs used postmortems, as was standard practice in their fields for incident response. The Flight Operations Team, which handled the day-to-day operations of steering launched balloons, captured in-flight issues in a tracking system. The tracking system was part of the anomaly resolution system devised to identify and resolve root cause problems. Seeking to complement the anomaly resolution system, the Flight Operations Team incorporated the SRE software team&#39;s postmortem format for incidents that needed further investigation— for example, failure to avoid a storm system, deviations from the simulated (expected) flight path that led to an incident, and flight operator actions that directly or indirectly caused an incident. Given that most incidents spanned multiple teams (e.g., when automation failed to catch an incorrect command sent by a flight operator, which resulted in a hardware failure), utilizing a consistent postmortem format across teams simplified collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Aviation and Systems Safety Team, which focused on safety related to the flight system and flight process, also brought their own tradition and best practices of postmortems. Their motto, &#34;Own our Safety&#34;, brought a commitment to continually improving safety performance and building a positive safety culture across the company. This was one of the strengths of Loon&#39;s culture: all the organizations were aligned not just on our audacious vision to &#34;connect people everywhere&#34;, but also on doing so safely and effectively. However, because industry standards for postmortems and how to handle different types of problems varied across teams, there was some divergence in process. We proactively encouraged teams to share postmortems between teams, between orgs, and across the company so that anyone could provide feedback and insight into an incident. In that way, anyone at Loon could contribute to a postmortem, see how an incident was handled, and learn about the breadth of challenges that Loon was solving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While everyone agreed that postmortems were an important practice, in a fast moving start-up culture, it was a struggle to comprehensively follow through on action items. This probably comes as no surprise to developers in similar environments— when the platform or services that require investment are rapidly changing or being replaced, it&#39;s hard to spend resources on not repeating the same mistakes. Ideally, we would have prioritized postmortems that focused on best practices and learnings that were applicable to multiple generations of the platform, but those weren&#39;t easy to identify at the time of each incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the company was not especially large, the novelty of Loon&#39;s platform and interconnectedness of its operations made determining which team was responsible for writing a postmortem and investigating root causes difficult. For example, a 20 minute service disruption on the ground might be caused by a loss of connectivity from the balloon to the backhaul network, a pointing error with the antennae on the payload, insufficient battery levels, or wind that temporarily blew the balloon out of range. Actual causes could be quite nuanced, and often were attributable to interactions between multiple sub-systems. Thus, we had a chicken-and-egg problem: which team should start the postmortem and investigation, and when should they hand off the postmortem to the teams that likely owned the faulty system or process? Not all teams had a culture of postmortems, so the process could stall depending on the system where the root cause originated. For that reason, Loon&#39;s Prod Team/SREs advocated for a company-wide blameless postmortem culture. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of how Loon used postmortems, especially in software development and Prod Team, was in line with SRE industry standards. In the early days of Loon, however, there were no service level objectives or agreements (SLO/As). As Loon was an R&amp;amp;D project, we wrote postmortems when a test network failed to boot after launch, or when performance didn&#39;t meet the team&#39;s predictions, rather than for &#34;service outages&#34;. Later on, when Loon supplied commercial service in disaster relief areas in Peru and Kenya, the Prod Team could more clearly identify the types of user-facing incidents that required postmortems due to failure to meet SLAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Improving and Standardizing Loon&#39;s Postmortem Processes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving Loon from an R&amp;amp;D model to the model of reliability and safety necessary for a commercial offering required more than simply performing postmortems. Sharing the postmortems openly and widely across Loon was critical to building a culture of continuous improvement and addressing root causes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To increase cross-team awareness of incidents, in 2019 we instituted a Postmortem Working Group. In addition to reading and discussing recent postmortems from across the company, the goals of the working group were to make it easier to write postmortems, promote the practice of writing postmortems, increase sharing across teams, and discuss the findings of these incidents in order to learn the patterns of failure. Its founding goal was to &#34;&lt;i&gt;Cultivate a postmortem culture in Loon to encourage thoughtful risk taking, to take advantage of mistakes, and to provide structure to support improvement over time.&lt;/i&gt;&#34; While the volume of postmortems could ebb and flow across weeks and months, over multiple years of commercial service we expected to be able to identify macro-trends that needed to be addressed with the cooperation of multiple teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Postmortem Working Group, we also created a postmortem mailing list and a repository of all postmortems, and presented a &#34;Lunch &amp;amp; Learn&#34; on blameless postmortems (see example slide below). Prod Team and several other teams&#39; meetings had a standing agenda item to review postmortems of interest from across the company, and we sent a semi-annual email celebrating Loon&#39;s &#34;best-of&#34; recent incidents: the most interesting or educational outages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;loon.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/loon.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we had a standardized postmortem template in place, we could adopt and reuse it to document commercial service field tests. By recording a timeline and incidents, defining a process and space to determine root causes of problems, recording measurements and metrics, and providing the structure for action item tracking, we brought the benefits of postmortem retrospectives to prospective tasks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Loon began commercial trials in countries like Peru and Kenya, we conducted numerous field tests. These tests required engineers from Loon and/or the telco partner to travel to remote locations to measure the strength of the LTE signal on the ground. Prod Team proactively used the postmortem template to document the field tests. It provided a useful format to record the log of test events, results that did and did not match expectations, and links to further investigations into those failures. As a cutting edge project in a highly variable operating environment, using the postmortem template as our default testing template was an acknowledgement that we were in a state of constant and rapid iteration and improvement. These trials took place in early to mid 2020, under the sudden specter of Covid and the subsequent shift towards working from home. The structured communications at the core of Loon&#39;s postmortem structure were particularly helpful as we moved from in-person coordination rooms to WFH.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Loon Learned from Standardizing Postmortems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postmortems are widely used in various industries because they are effective. At Loon, we saw that even fast moving startups and R&amp;amp;D projects should invest early in a transparent and blameless postmortem culture. That culture should include a clear process for writing postmortems, clear guidelines for when to conduct a postmortem, and a staffed commitment to follow up on action items. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meta-reviews across postmortems and outages revealed several trends. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The many points of failure we observed across the range of postmortems were indicative of both the complexity of Loon&#39;s systems and the complexity of some of its supporting infrastructure. Postmortems are equally adept at finding flaky tests and fragile processes vs. hardware failures or satellite network outages. These are complexities familiar to many startups, where postmortems can help manage the tradeoff between making changes safely vs. moving quickly and trying many new things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loon was still operating a superhero culture: across a wide range of issues, a small set of experts were repeatedly called upon to fix the system. This dynamic is common in startups, and not meant as a pejorative, but was markedly different from the system maturity that many of Prod Team/SRE were used to. Once we identified this pattern, our plan for commercial service was to staff a 24x7 oncall rotation, complemented by Program Managers driving intention processes to de-risk production&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postmortems provided a space to ask questions like, &#34;What other issues could pop up in this realm?&#34;, which prompted us to solve for the broader case of problems rather than specific problems we&#39;d already seen. This practice also stopped people from brushing off problems in the name of development speed, or from dismissing issues because they &#34;just concerned a prototype&#34;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips and Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the specifics of Loon&#39;s journey to standardize postmortems tell the story of one company, we have some tips and takeaways that should be applicable at most organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tip 1: Adopting a blameless postmortem culture requires everyone to participate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the initiative of writing postmortems often originates with a software team, if you want every team to adopt the practice, we suggest trying the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give a talk about postmortems and how and why they could benefit all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Form a postmortem working group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invite people representing different teams to be part of the postmortem working group. They will give insights into what could work better for their respective teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t make the postmortem working group responsible for writing the postmortems— this approach doesn&#39;t scale. Reviewing and consulting on postmortems may be in scope of their duties, especially while new teams are adopting this practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tip 2: Define a lightweight postmortem process&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Especially during adoption, you want teams to see the benefits of postmortems, not the burden of writing them. Creating a postmortem template with minimum requirements can be helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tip 3: Define a clear owner for postmortems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who should write a postmortem and when? For software teams with an oncall rotation, the answer is clear: the person who was oncall during the incident is the owner, and we write postmortems when a service interruption breached SLOs. But when the service has no SLOs, or when a team doesn&#39;t have an oncall rotation, you need defined criteria. Bonus points if the outage involves multiple systems and teams. The following exercises can help in this area:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflect on these topics from the point of view of each team, and from the point of view of the interaction between teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each team, define what type of incident(s) should trigger a postmortem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the team, define who should own writing each postmortem. Avoid putting the entire burden on the same person frequently; consider forming a rotation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Tip 4: Encourage blameless postmortems and make people proud of them&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider some activities that can help foster the blameless postmortem culture:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write a report of the best postmortems over a given period and circulate them broadly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conduct training on how to write postmortems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Train managers and encourage them to prioritize postmortems on their teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Loon shut down, addressing all these points was still a work in progress. We don&#39;t have a teachable moment of “this postmortem process will solve your failures”, because postmortems don&#39;t do that. However, we could see where postmortems stopped us from needing to deal with the same failures repeatedly… and where sometimes we did experience repeat incidents because the AIs from the first postmortem weren&#39;t prioritized enough. And so this piece of writing— effectively, a postmortem on Loon&#39;s postmortems—serves up a familiar lesson: postmortems work, but only as well as they are widely accepted and adhered to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><paragraph-block _nghost-c67=""><div _ngcontent-c67="" innerhtml="&lt;p&gt;Founded by Google SRE alumni, it is no surprise that Loon&#39;s Production Engineering/SRE team instituted a culture of blameless postmortems that became a key feature of Loon&#39;s approach to incident response. Blameless postmortems originated as an aerospace practice in the mid-20th century, so it was particularly fitting that they came full circle to be used at a company that melded cutting edge aerospace work with the development of a communications platform and the world&#39;s first stratospheric temporospatial software defined network. The use of postmortems became a standardizing factor across Loon&#39;s teams&amp;#8212; from avionics and manufacturing, to flight operations, to software platforms and network service. This blog post discusses how Loon moved from a heterogeneous approach to postmortems to eventually standardize and share this practice across the organization&amp;#8212; a shift that helped the company move from R&amp;amp;D to commercial service in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Postmortems&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many industries have adopted the use of postmortems&amp;#8212; they are fairly common in high-risk fields where mistakes can be fatal or extremely expensive. Postmortems are also widespread in industries and projects where bad processes or assumptions can incur expensive project development costs and avoiding repeat mistakes is a priority. Individual industries and organizations often develop their own postmortem standards or templates so that postmortems are easier to create and digest across teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blameless postmortems likely originated in the healthcare and aerospace industries in the mid-20th century. Because of the high cost of failure, these industries needed to create a culture of transparency and continuous improvement that could only come from openly discussing failure. As the original SRE book states, blameless postmortems are key to &amp;#34;an environment where every &#39;mistake&#39; is seen as an opportunity to strengthen the system.&amp;#34;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of a postmortem is to document an incident or event in order to foster learning from it, both among the affected teams and beyond. The postmortem usually includes a timeline of what happened, the solutions implemented, the incident&#39;s impact, the investigation into root causes, and changes or follow-ups to stop it from happening again. To facilitate learning, SRE&#39;s postmortem format includes both what went well&amp;#8212; acknowledging the successes that should be maintained and expanded&amp;#8212; and what went poorly and needs to be changed. In this way, postmortem action items are key to prioritizing work that ensures the same failures don&#39;t happen again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Loon&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loon aimed to supply internet access to unserved and underserved populations around the world by providing connectivity via stratospheric balloons. These high altitude &amp;#8220;flying cell towers&amp;#8221; covered a much wider footprint than a terrestrial tower, and could be deployed (and repositioned) into the most remote corners of the earth without expensive overland transportation and installation. As the first company to attempt anything like this, Loon dealt with a number of systems that were complex, challenging, or novel: superpressure balloons designed to stay aloft for hundreds of days, wind-dependant steering, a software defined network consisting of constantly moving nodes, and extremes of temperature and weather at 20km above Earth&#39;s surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Prod Team&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial high-risk operations of Loon&#39;s mission were avionic: could we launch and steer balloons carrying a networking payload long enough to reach and serve the targeted region? As such, the earliest failure reports within Loon (which weren&#39;t officially called &amp;#34;postmortems&amp;#34; at the time) mostly involved balloon construction or flight, and drew on the experience of team members who had worked in the Avionics, Reliability Engineering, and/or Flight Safety fields. As Loon&#39;s systems evolved and matured, they started to require operational reliability, as well. Just before graduating from a purely R&amp;amp;D project in Google&#39;s &amp;#34;moonshot factory&amp;#34; incubator X to a company with commercial goals, Loon started building a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team known internally as Prod Team.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to effectively offer internet connectivity to users, Loon had to solve network serving failures with the same rigor as hardware failures. Prod Team took the lead on a number of practices to improve network reliability. The Prod Team had three primary goals:&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that the fleet&#39;s automation, management, and safety-critical systems were built and operated to meet the high safety bar of the aviation industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lead the integration of the communications services (e.g., LTE) end to end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Own the mission of fielding and providing a reliable commercial service (Loon Library) in the real world.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Postmortems at Loon&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Early Days&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Postmortems were one tool for reaching Prod Team&#39;s (SRE&#39;s) goals. Prod Team often interacted with SREs in other infrastructure support teams that the Loon service connected to, such as the team developing the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), our telco partner counterparts, and teams that handle edge network connectivity. Postmortems provided a common tool for sharing incident information across all these teams, and could even span multiple companies when upstream problems impacted customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Loon, postmortems served the following goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Document and transcribe the events, actions, and remedies related to an incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provide a feedback loop to rectify problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicate where to build better safeguards and alerts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Break down silos between teams in order to facilitate cross-functional knowledge sharing and accelerate development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identify macro themes and blind spots over the longer term.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of aerospace and high tech brought two strong practices of writing postmortems, but also the challenge of how to own, investigate, or follow up on problems that crossed those boundaries, or when it wasn&#39;t clear where the system fault lay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loon&#39;s teams across hardware, software, and operations orgs used postmortems, as was standard practice in their fields for incident response. The Flight Operations Team, which handled the day-to-day operations of steering launched balloons, captured in-flight issues in a tracking system. The tracking system was part of the anomaly resolution system devised to identify and resolve root cause problems. Seeking to complement the anomaly resolution system, the Flight Operations Team incorporated the SRE software team&#39;s postmortem format for incidents that needed further investigation&amp;#8212; for example, failure to avoid a storm system, deviations from the simulated (expected) flight path that led to an incident, and flight operator actions that directly or indirectly caused an incident. Given that most incidents spanned multiple teams (e.g., when automation failed to catch an incorrect command sent by a flight operator, which resulted in a hardware failure), utilizing a consistent postmortem format across teams simplified collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Aviation and Systems Safety Team, which focused on safety related to the flight system and flight process, also brought their own tradition and best practices of postmortems. Their motto, &amp;#34;Own our Safety&amp;#34;, brought a commitment to continually improving safety performance and building a positive safety culture across the company. This was one of the strengths of Loon&#39;s culture: all the organizations were aligned not just on our audacious vision to &amp;#34;connect people everywhere&amp;#34;, but also on doing so safely and effectively. However, because industry standards for postmortems and how to handle different types of problems varied across teams, there was some divergence in process. We proactively encouraged teams to share postmortems between teams, between orgs, and across the company so that anyone could provide feedback and insight into an incident. In that way, anyone at Loon could contribute to a postmortem, see how an incident was handled, and learn about the breadth of challenges that Loon was solving.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While everyone agreed that postmortems were an important practice, in a fast moving start-up culture, it was a struggle to comprehensively follow through on action items. This probably comes as no surprise to developers in similar environments&amp;#8212; when the platform or services that require investment are rapidly changing or being replaced, it&#39;s hard to spend resources on not repeating the same mistakes. Ideally, we would have prioritized postmortems that focused on best practices and learnings that were applicable to multiple generations of the platform, but those weren&#39;t easy to identify at the time of each incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the company was not especially large, the novelty of Loon&#39;s platform and interconnectedness of its operations made determining which team was responsible for writing a postmortem and investigating root causes difficult. For example, a 20 minute service disruption on the ground might be caused by a loss of connectivity from the balloon to the backhaul network, a pointing error with the antennae on the payload, insufficient battery levels, or wind that temporarily blew the balloon out of range. Actual causes could be quite nuanced, and often were attributable to interactions between multiple sub-systems. Thus, we had a chicken-and-egg problem: which team should start the postmortem and investigation, and when should they hand off the postmortem to the teams that likely owned the faulty system or process? Not all teams had a culture of postmortems, so the process could stall depending on the system where the root cause originated. For that reason, Loon&#39;s Prod Team/SREs advocated for a company-wide blameless postmortem culture.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of how Loon used postmortems, especially in software development and Prod Team, was in line with SRE industry standards. In the early days of Loon, however, there were no service level objectives or agreements (SLO/As). As Loon was an R&amp;amp;D project, we wrote postmortems when a test network failed to boot after launch, or when performance didn&#39;t meet the team&#39;s predictions, rather than for &amp;#34;service outages&amp;#34;. Later on, when Loon supplied commercial service in disaster relief areas in Peru and Kenya, the Prod Team could more clearly identify the types of user-facing incidents that required postmortems due to failure to meet SLAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Improving and Standardizing Loon&#39;s Postmortem Processes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving Loon from an R&amp;amp;D model to the model of reliability and safety necessary for a commercial offering required more than simply performing postmortems. Sharing the postmortems openly and widely across Loon was critical to building a culture of continuous improvement and addressing root causes.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To increase cross-team awareness of incidents, in 2019 we instituted a Postmortem Working Group. In addition to reading and discussing recent postmortems from across the company, the goals of the working group were to make it easier to write postmortems, promote the practice of writing postmortems, increase sharing across teams, and discuss the findings of these incidents in order to learn the patterns of failure. Its founding goal was to &amp;#34;&lt;i&gt;Cultivate a postmortem culture in Loon to encourage thoughtful risk taking, to take advantage of mistakes, and to provide structure to support improvement over time.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#34; While the volume of postmortems could ebb and flow across weeks and months, over multiple years of commercial service we expected to be able to identify macro-trends that needed to be addressed with the cooperation of multiple teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Postmortem Working Group, we also created a postmortem mailing list and a repository of all postmortems, and presented a &amp;#34;Lunch &amp;amp; Learn&amp;#34; on blameless postmortems (see example slide below). Prod Team and several other teams&#39; meetings had a standing agenda item to review postmortems of interest from across the company, and we sent a semi-annual email celebrating Loon&#39;s &amp;#34;best-of&amp;#34; recent incidents: the most interesting or educational outages.&lt;/p&gt;"><p>Founded by Google SRE alumni, it is no surprise that Loon&#39;s Production Engineering/SRE team instituted a culture of blameless postmortems that became a key feature of Loon&#39;s approach to incident response.

      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt; is an open source Infrastructure as Code tool that is popular with platform developers building reusable cloud automation. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt; continues to add support for the latest Google Cloud features, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/using-terraform-to-enable-config-sync-on-a-gke-cluster&#34;&gt;Anthos on GKE&lt;/a&gt;, and our teams continue to expand Terraform integrations including &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/foundation-toolkit&#34;&gt;Cloud Foundation Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/terraform-validator#terraform-validator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform Validator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do teams use Terraform on Google Cloud? While the simplest approach is to run &lt;code&gt;terraform init&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; directly from your terminal,  it cannot be recommended for automating your production deployments. First, there is a decision on how to store your Terraform &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; in a way that is secure, compliant and enables team collaboration. Secondly there’s a question of scale and reliability. Over the course of even the simplest cloud deployment, Terraform can end up making thousands of Create/Read/Update/Delete API calls to the endpoints used by the Terraform providers, some of which will inevitably hit quota issues or need to be retried for other reasons. For platform administrators, who are looking to ensure the best deployment practices for their curated Terraform solutions,  while benefiting from the simplicity of Google Cloud Console, there’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/private-catalog-uses-terraform-to-update-available-solutions&#34;&gt;Terraform Private Catalog integration&lt;/a&gt; that we enabled earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of Private Catalog, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/build&#34;&gt;Cloud Build&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/storage&#34;&gt;Cloud Storage&lt;/a&gt; have been the recommended approach to use Terraform on Google Cloud. Using a remote&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;backend&lt;/a&gt; prevents race conditions and simplifies sharing reusable modules between different configurations. With Cloud Build you can configure a GitOps CI/CD pipeline to automatically &lt;code&gt;plan&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;apply&lt;/code&gt; your Terraform configuration when changes are pushed into the repo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are widely popularized benefits explored in &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/architecture/managing-infrastructure-as-code&#34;&gt;Managing infrastructure as code with Terraform, Cloud Build, and GitOps&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, there are lesser known advantages of Cloud Build, particularly for enterprise customers: Cloud Build’s concurrency capabilities and VPC-SC support, Cloud Storage versioning, security and compliance. Let’s explore these benefits in more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Build’s ability to scale makes it capable to process multiple Terraform deployments across the regions globally and simultaneously. By default, Cloud Build supports 30 concurrent builds, with additional builds queued and processed after the running builds complete. In some cases it may not be enough. Customers who initiate parallel deployments to multiple zones, or, those who provision infrastructure on behalf of multiple tenants, often require running more concurrent deployments to complete all of them within the allotted deployment window. Cloud Build private pool feature allows up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/build/quotas&#34;&gt;100 concurrent builds&lt;/a&gt; which may be further adjusted upon request. This is an example of creating a private pool and then using it when submitting a build:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A full step by step example of creating a private pool and submitting 80+ Terraform deployments with Cloud Build simultaneously is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/terraform/examples/infra_at_scale&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Cloud Build removes the need to build a custom high-scale Terraform provisioning service and provides &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/view-build-results&#34;&gt;observability and diagnostics&lt;/a&gt; for each of the build instances launched and their results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Cloud Build with private pools enables recommended security features, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/private-pools/using-vpc-service-controls&#34;&gt;VPC Service Controls&lt;/a&gt;that allows setting secure perimeter to protect against data exfiltration, with additional restrictions to further restrict it to using the specified private pools. This makes it unnecessary to configure a dedicated &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;bastion host&lt;/a&gt; inside the perimeter, which improves the overall security posture.&lt;/p&gt;Beyond just using Cloud Storage for remote storage, additional reasons to use Cloud Storage include versioning, security and compliance. Enabling versioning protects against state file corruption and allows you to view earlier versions. Versioning can be enabled with &lt;code&gt;gsutil&lt;/code&gt; command:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to versioning, you can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/security/encryption/customer-supplied-encryption-keys&#34;&gt;Customer-Supplied Encryption Keys&lt;/a&gt; to encrypt the Terraform state file. After you generated the key you can specify it as encryption_key parameter of your backend object:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once encrypted you can still view the contents of your state by &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/customer-supplied-keys#gsutil&#34;&gt;adding encryption_key option to boto configuration file&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, Cloud Storage is one of the Google Cloud services covered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance/fedramp&#34;&gt;FedRAMP High&lt;/a&gt;, which is important for enterprises  that are seeking their own FedRAMP on top of Google Cloud (for more details see &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/security/compliance&#34;&gt;Compliance resource center&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To summarize, using Cloud Build and Cloud Storage for your Terraform deployments enable high scalability, security and compliance with simpler configuration and via familiar &lt;code&gt;gcloud&lt;/code&gt; and Google Cloud console interface.

      <title>Want to supercharge your DevOps practice? Research says try SRE</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/supercharge-your-devops-practice-with-sre-principles/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliability matters. When users can’t access your application, if it’s slow to respond, or it behaves unexpectedly, they don’t get the value that you intend to provide. That’s why at Google we like to say that &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/workbook/reaching-beyond/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;reliability is the most important feature of any system&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Its impact can be seen all the way to the bottom line, as downtime comes with steep costs—to revenue, to reputation, and to user loyalty. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devops-research.com/research.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DevOps Research and Assessment&lt;/a&gt; (DORA) project, we’ve recognized the importance of delivering a consistent experience to users. We measure this with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance&#34;&gt;Four Key&lt;/a&gt; metrics—two metrics that track the velocity of deploying new releases, balanced against two that capture the initial stability of those releases. A team that rates well on all four metrics is not only good at shipping code, they’re shipping code that’s good. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, these four signals, which focus on the path to a deployment and its immediate effects, are less diagnostic of subsequent success throughout the lifespan of a release. In 2018, DORA began to study the ongoing stability of software delivered as a service (as typified by web applications), which we captured in an additional metric for availability, to explore the impact of technical operations on organizational performance. This year, we expanded our inquiry into this area, starting by renaming availability to reliability. Reliability (sometimes abbreviated as r9y) is a more general term that encompasses dimensions including response latency and content validity, as well as availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/&#34;&gt;2021 State of DevOps Report’s&lt;/a&gt; cluster analysis, teams were segmented into four groups based on the Four Key metrics of software delivery. At first glance, we found that the application of reliability practices is not directly correlated to software delivery performance —  teams that score well on delivery metrics may not be the same as those who consistently practice modern operations. However, in combination, software delivery performance and reliability engineering exert a powerful influence on organizational outcomes: elite software delivery teams that also meet their reliability goals are 1.8 times more likely to report better business outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;SRE.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/SRE.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How Google achieves reliability: SRE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Google’s early days, we took a traditional approach to technical operations; the bulk of the work involved manual interventions in reaction to discrete problems. However, as our products began to rapidly acquire users across the globe, we realized that this approach wasn’t sustainable. It couldn’t scale to match the increasing size and complexity of our systems, and even attempting to keep up would require an untenable investment in our operations workforce. So, for the past 15+ years, we’ve been practicing and iterating on an approach called &lt;a href=&#34;http://sre.google&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Site Reliability Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (SRE). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SRE provides a framework for measurement, prioritization, and information sharing to help teams balance between the velocity of feature releases and the predictable behavior of deployed services. It emphasizes the use of automation to reduce risk and to free up engineering capacity for strategic work. This may sound a lot like a description of DevOps; indeed, these disciplines have many shared values. That similarity meant that when, in 2016, Google published the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sre.google/books&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;first book on Site Reliability Engineering&lt;/a&gt;, it made waves in the DevOps community as practitioners recognized a like-minded movement. It also caused some confusion: some have framed DevOps and SRE as being in conflict or competition with each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our view is that, having arisen from similar challenges and espousing similar objectives, DevOps and SRE can be mutually compatible. We posited that, metaphorically, “&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/uTEL8Ff1Zvk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;class SRE implements DevOps&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#39;&#39;—SRE provides a way to realize DevOps objectives. Inspired by these communities’ continued growth and ongoing exchange of ideas, we sought to investigate their relationship further. This year, we expanded the scope of data collection to assess the extent of SRE adoption across the industry, and to learn how such modern operational practices interact with DORA’s model of software delivery performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://sre.google/books&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;published literature on SRE&lt;/a&gt;, we added the key elements of the framework as items in our survey of practitioners. We took care to avoid as much as possible any jargon, instead preferring plain language to describe how modern operations teams go about their work. Respondents reported on such practices as: defining reliability in terms of user-visible behavior; the use of automation to allow engineers to focus on strategic work; and having well-defined, well-practiced protocols for incident response. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along the way, we found that using SRE to implement DevOps is much more widely practiced than we thought. SRE, and related disciplines like Facebook’s Production Engineering, have a reputation for being niche disciplines, practiced only by a handful of tech giants. To the contrary, we found that SRE is used in some capacity by a majority of the teams in the DORA survey, with 52% of respondents reporting the use of one or more SRE practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SRE is a force multiplier for software delivery excellence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph_with_image&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--wrap-medium &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;SRE 1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/SRE_1.1203064715921295.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the results, we found compelling evidence that SRE is an effective approach to modern operations across the spectrum of organizations. In addition to driving better business outcomes, SRE helps focus efforts—teams that achieve their reliability goals report that they are able to spend more time coding, as they’re less consumed by reacting to incidents. These findings are consistent with the observation that &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/resources/roi-of-devops-transformation-whitepaper&#34;&gt;having reliable services can directly impact revenue&lt;/a&gt;, as well as offering engineers greater flexibility to use their time to improve their systems, rather than simply repairing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while SRE is widely used and has demonstrable benefits, few respondents indicated that their teams have fully implemented every SRE technique we examined. Increased application of SRE has benefits at all levels: within every cluster of software delivery performance, teams that also meet their reliability goals outperform other members of their cluster in regard to business outcomes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;On the SRE road to DevOps excellence&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SRE is more than a toolset; it’s also a cultural mindset about the role of operations staff. SRE is a learning discipline, aimed at understanding information and continuously iterating in response. Accordingly, adopting SRE takes time, and success requires starting small, and applying an iterative approach to SRE itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some ways to get started:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find free books and articles at &lt;a href=&#34;http://sre.google&#34;&gt;sre.google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join a conversation with fellow practitioners, at all different stages of SRE implementation, at &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/reliability-discuss&#34;&gt;bit.ly/reliability-discuss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speak to your GCP account manager about our professional service offerings &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Apply to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/awards/devops/?eligible_for_cloud_free_trial=true&#34;&gt;DevOps awards&lt;/a&gt; to show how your organization is implementing award winning SRE practices along with the DORA principles!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

      <title>Empowering DevOps to foster customer loyalty in modern retail with MongoDB Atlas on Google Cloud</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/retail/unlocking-the-power-of-modern-devops/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer demands are becoming more complex, driven by high expectations for personalized experiences that strike the right chord at the perfect time. One study from McKinsey found that&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-value-of-getting-personalization-right-or-wrong-is-multiplying&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;nearly three-quarters of consumers demand personalization&lt;/a&gt; when interacting with retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers old and new of any size must embrace the challenges head on and learn to capture customer loyalty. While each business has a unique journey toward modernizing its business, all of them share something in common: Effective approaches to DevOps and data analytics underpin their success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Retailers sometimes struggle to change previous retail models into the much more intimate, personalized, and real-time retail experiences that consumers now want, whether shopping in-store or online. At the same time, retailers and many newcomers are jumping all in, and devising exceptional experiences that transform shopper experiences and elevate expectations even further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MongoDB and Google Cloud have been helping retailers of all sizes better address quickly changing market opportunities. As retailers continue to need more powerful systems of engagement and data analytics, the combination of MongoDB Atlas and Google Cloud solutions offer retailers such as 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. a solid mix of proven IT infrastructure and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Maximizing data value for developers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;DevOps is increasingly tasked with creating experiences that will bring customers to a retail website, and guide them through the purchasing process. Along the way, they need to build in steps that keep customers fully engaged in the buying process and discourage things like cart abandonment. A successful build depends a lot on how much quality data is available about customer shopping experiences and how easy it is for DevOps teams to derive insights from that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud is very much a developer’s cloud, and we at MongoDB are very much a developer’s database. We like the breadth of Google Cloud services, which pair well with our products. Our collaboration with Google Cloud feels very natural both in terms of the technology we develop and how we are approaching serving our clients’ needs. Together, we give DevOps teams at retailers a modern toolkit to maximize the value of their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cloud-based environment supported by Google Cloud and MongoDB Atlas increases the speed and success of experimentation and ultimately delivers solutions with the greatest impact. With agile environments like ours, teams experiment much faster, leading to more innovative shopping experiences that differentiate a retailer from their competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any cloud solution has to be usable for retailers of all sizes so that they can develop services according to their unique needs, expertise, and visions. The goal should be to empower a retailer’s DevOps team to be as self-sufficient as possible, and not have to rely on a third-party every time changes need to be made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an industry facing extremely tight margins—and where a two percent efficiency gain or 2x acceleration of time to market can make or break the success of a project—gaining any edge is essential for retailers. Google Cloud and MongoDB provide that edge to retailers, as well as to other companies across industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cultivating a vision at 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. is an exceptional example of what can be achieved when going all in with modern data and DevOps solutions. Chief Technology Officer Abi Sachdeva, has pursued emerging technologies to support its business teams with the latest technologies to drive value for its customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abi has been laser-focused on delivering new personalized experiences by continually innovating customer-facing services. Driven by a commitment to foster engagement across its industry-leading brands through a centralized customer experience, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. built an e-commerce platform that is inclusive of both products and resources aimed at improving how people express themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To best manage all the eCommerce environments associated and ensure outstanding customer service, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc. with MongoDB and Google Cloud to revolutionize its DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“With the help of MongoDB and Google Cloud, we transformed people, processes, and our technology. It has been a very stable experience requiring little administrative work,” says Abi. “Traditional technologies weighed us down in the past. MongoDB and Google Cloud deliver data models and DevOps solutions that accelerate our development and deployment.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MongoDB Atlas , Inc. with aggregation pipelines and a distributed system design that help it to scale quickly, while Google Cloud made its new approach to agile and DevOps a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;he speed and agility that come with cloud services, companies like 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.  keep up with the constantly changing customer preferences. With proven cloud solutions that at once increase overall IT effectiveness and decrease the burdens on IT teams, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.  is better positioned to constantly experiment, innovate, and deliver experiences that delight customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The fully managed MongoDB Atlas database on Google Cloud has unlocked tremendous potential in our IT architecture,” says Abi. “From agility in scaling and improved resource management to seamless global clusters and premium monitoring, MongoDB and Google Cloud reduce complexity and allow our teams to stay lean and focused on innovation rather than infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking toward the holidays and beyond&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The very same systems that encourage experimentation and innovation can position retailers and other companies to excel in during and long after the holiday season. Companies need elasticity, scalability, and agility to facilitate experimentation and to navigate the turbulent external factors across their marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every holiday season is challenging for retailers, but current supply chain concerns combined with massive changes to how people shop as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will make 2021 a particularly important year for the industry. I believe that companies that have increased their backend elasticity and improved their DevOps culture will fare especially well amid the market upheaval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As organizations modernize IT, it will be increasingly important to pair the possibilities of software and infrastructure to enable smaller DevOps teams to act independently and quickly. This improves culture across the business as people are more empowered and supported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, I encourage DevOps professionals to place more importance on understanding customers, business values, and to be people-first in their approaches to work. By combining this level of business experience with great coding skills, smaller teams can bolster a retailer’s performance this holiday season and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are proud to work with Google Cloud to develop and deliver new ways for DevOps in retail and other industries to experiment, innovate, and deploy groundbreaking experiences that transform how people achieve their goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the future of retail innovation,&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waNVXeHtzOs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;watch this video&lt;/a&gt; featuring members of the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., MongoDB, and Google Cloud teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/topics/retail/how-one-retailer-migrated-its-ecommerce-platform-to-google-cloud/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/google_flowers.max-500x500.jpg&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;Delivering smiles and sparking innovation at 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;See how gift retailer 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., migrated its customer touchpoints to cloud, including GKE and BigQuery, to build a microse...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

With proven cloud solutions that at once increase overall IT effectiveness and decrease the burdens on IT teams, 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc.  is better positioned to constantly experiment, innovate, and deliver experiences that delight customers.</p><p>“The fully managed MongoDB Atlas database on Google Cloud has unlocked tremendous potential in our IT architecture,” says Abi. “From agility in scaling and improved resource management to seamless global clusters and premium monitoring, MongoDB and Google Cloud reduce complexity and allow our teams to stay lean and focused on innovation rather than infrastructure.”</p><h3>Looking toward the holidays and beyond</h3><p>The very same systems that encourage experimentation and innovation can position retailers and other companies to excel in during and long after the holiday season. Companies need elasticity, scalability, and agility to facilitate experimentation and to navigate the turbulent external factors across their marketplace.</p><p>Every holiday season is challenging for retailers, but current supply chain concerns combined with massive changes to how people shop as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic will make 2021 a particularly important year for the industry. I believe that companies that have increased their backend elasticity and improved their DevOps culture will fare especially well amid the market upheaval.</p><p>As organizations modernize IT, it will be increasingly important to pair the possibilities of software and infrastructure to enable smaller DevOps teams to act independently and quickly. This improves culture across the business as people are more empowered and supported.</p><p>In addition, I encourage DevOps professionals to place more importance on understanding customers, business values, and to be people-first in their approaches to work. By combining this level of business experience with great coding skills, smaller teams can bolster a retailer’s performance this holiday season and beyond.</p><p>We are proud to work with Google Cloud to develop and deliver new ways for DevOps in retail and other industries to experiment, innovate, and deploy groundbreaking experiences that transform how people achieve their goals.</p><p>To learn more about the future of retail innovation,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waNVXeHtzOs" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="2" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://www.youtube.com" track-metadata-module="post"> watch this video</a> featuring members of the 1-800-FLOWERS.COM, Inc., MongoDB, and Google Cloud teams.</p></div></paragraph-block></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How Sabre is using SRE to lead a successful digital transformation</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sabre-leverages-google-cloud-and-site-reliability-engineering/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/b&gt;: Today we hear from Kenny Kon, an SRE Director at Sabre. Kenny shares about how they have been able to successfully adopt Google’s SRE framework by leveraging their partnership with Google Cloud. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a leader in the travel industry, Sabre Corporation is driving innovation in the global travel industry and developing solutions that help airlines, hotels, and travel agencies transform the traveler experience and satisfy the ever-evolving needs of its customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to build these solutions, we joined forces with Google Cloud as our preferred cloud provider to accelerate our digital transformation. We chose Google because they understand the industry we are in as they also manage travel products such as Google Travel. Google also created &lt;a href=&#34;http://cloud.google.com/sre&#34;&gt;SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)&lt;/a&gt;, and operates with SRE principles at the Google scale, which is what intrigued us the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially we started with a multi-cloud model, but that didn’t help us move faster so we consolidated to just Google Cloud. To speed our transformation along, we have adopted Google SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) practices which enables us to balance reliability and speed. We have been able to make this transformation with the direct help of Google Cloud’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/consulting&#34;&gt;Professional Services Organization (PSO)&lt;/a&gt; along with Google Cloud’s tooling, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/monitoring&#34;&gt;Cloud Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging&#34;&gt;Cloud Logging&lt;/a&gt;, and operating on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/spanner&#34;&gt;Cloud Spanner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In adopting SRE at Sabre, we’d like to highlight three key takeaways from the journey: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Find colleagues who are also passionate about shifting culture and adopting SRE&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a community within your organization who is dedicated to the SRE journey and motivated to make things happen. As we adopted SRE at Sabre I saw more and more people rallying and coming together to support the culture change. With some momentum built it was great to bring shared experiences to the team as we all spoke in the same language talking about SLOs, SLIs, and about how we measure things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the ways in which we built our community was by hosting monthly brown bag sessions. This is an informal gathering where teams come in and share their experiences and challenges, or teach on specific SRE topics such as SLOs or toil. We also created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-cloud-southlake/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;public Google Developer Group (GDG)&lt;/a&gt; and have hosted several Google SRE subject matter experts to speak on SRE principles and best practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Get your mid level leadership stakeholders on board&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know how important &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-success-starts-with-getting-leadership-on-board&#34;&gt;getting leadership buy in&lt;/a&gt; is to creating a successful SRE movement within an organization. That top-level buy-in is highly important to get resources and drive transformation across the organization, but what is sometimes missed is making it a priority to get mid-level leadership on board as well. It’s difficult to enact change from the ground up starting with practitioners at the bottom, and it’s also difficult to just have leadership buy in, as once it gets down to the middle, things may fall apart. It is imperative to have mid-level leaders on board as well, as they directly affect the culture and decisions of their teams. To avoid resistance, it is also important that the mid-level leadership (product, operations and engineering managers), i.e. people managers, will understand the motivations behind change so they will be onboard. Without that understanding, it will hinder mid-level leadership’s ability to communicate changes to the practitioners level and can impact the teams&#39; goal and allocated bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Don’t be afraid to get help from professionals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adopting SRE at a large organization is no simple feat. Partnering with &lt;a href=&#34;https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/pso_sre_google_cloud.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google’s SRE consulting experts&lt;/a&gt; has brought about a huge shift at Sabre. The value PSO brings is not just training, it&#39;s also listening. We’ve had experienced Googlers who understand our problems and have been at our stage in the SRE journey listen, analyze and tailor the approach specific to our team&#39;s goals. PSO helped us by shifting our engineering teams to be more customer centric, and aligning our product, operations, and development teams. But most importantly, they’ve helped to make our current teams happier, because they&#39;re not spinning their wheels, waiting around on blocked requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we partnered with PSO we were aware of who the key stakeholders in our organization are: the mid-level leadership and people managers. We made sure to bring them into our PSO discussions and decision making sessions and as a result, helped us to get more traction and solve the gap we had, enabling the middle-level and bringing them on board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the actions we have taken with help from our PSO SRE partners include adding a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/how-sre-teams-are-organized-and-how-to-get-started&#34;&gt;tiers of service&lt;/a&gt; approach, improving incident management through &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/shrinking-the-time-to-mitigate-production-incidents&#34;&gt;wheels of misfortune (WoM)&lt;/a&gt;, defining &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/practical-guide-to-setting-slos&#34;&gt;critical user journeys (CUJs)&lt;/a&gt;, and implementing &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/sre-error-budgets-and-maintenance-windows&#34;&gt;error budgets&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since putting these SRE practices into place, our business is more aligned to customer experience. We now invest org resources according to the needs of our customers and with that have reduced silos across our teams. Our Ops team is much happier since they can move faster and not have to block requests. SRE has taught us a common language, a common framework. Moreover, it gives this whole discipline a culture and meaning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/devops-sre/four-steps-to-jumpstarting-your-sre-practice/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/DevOps_BlogHeader_B_Rnd3.max-500x500.jpg&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;Four steps to jumpstarting your SRE practice&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;Once you have leadership buy-in, there are some things you can do to get the SRE ball rolling, fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

      <title>Foundations of a scalable website on GCP</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/networking/hosting-a-website-on-google-cloud-from-start-to-finish/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting a website can be hard, we get it. There are many vendors you have to work with and steps to tie together. What DNS records do I need to add? How do I enable DNSSEC? Is my website secure and safe from cyber attacks? These types of questions plague millions of website operators globally. We are excited to share that it is possible to manage all of these steps in one location using Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud offers you the ability to manage the entire lifecycle of a website from start to finish. You no longer have to worry about managing different subscriptions and understanding the integration between vendors. Leveraging the Google Cloud offering will allow for you to have a scalable, reliable, and safe deployment. Additionally, there are extra benefits that you can take advantage of, like getting Google Managed SSL certificates for free and taking advantage of best in class DDoS protection with our Cloud Armor solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Architecture diagram&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following architecture diagram illustrates all of the components of the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;architecture diagram.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/architecture_diagram.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key components of the solution:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Domains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud DNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compute and Storage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global HTTPs Load Balancer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Armor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud CDN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Buying a Domain on Google Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purchasing and verifying a domain can be a tricky process with many steps. Cloud Domains makes this easy and straightforward to manage. Cloud Domains integrates seamlessly with Cloud DNS making the management even easier. There is full API support which allows for programmatic management if you are managing a larger portfolio. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Managing DNS with Google Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Cloud DNS solution is a managed DNS infrastructure which is scalable and highly available. Easy management of private and public DNS zones makes this a one stop shop for DNS management. Public DNS records are anycasted globally using Google’s distributed network. It is easy and straightforward to enable DNSSEC which will help protect your end users from malicious actors.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Initializing Compute and setting up static object storage&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Running your backends on Google Cloud compute has numerous advantages. You can use a managed instance group to run your websites. Managed instance groups allow for a highly scalable and efficient deployment. When demand goes up the number of instances will scale seamlessly, and likewise if demand falls the active compute can scale down. This allows for you to only be running what you need at a given moment. You can easily create multi-zone deployments which increases reliability and performance. With full API support, automation and management is easy and fast. Using a managed instance group allows for you to automatically and safely deploy updates with a variety of customizations available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For static objects you can store them in our Cloud Storage solution. This is perfect for content like images and videos which are not constantly changing. You can store large quantities of data which is available worldwide. It is easy to transfer content into Cloud Storage with multiple tools available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Setting up an external https load balancer&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The external https load balancer is a global proxy-based layer 7 solution that serves as the entry point for all of your traffic onto Google’s network. Our advanced load balancing solution allows for integrated traffic management and is highly customizable to fit your needs. You can leverage a Google managed SSL certificate for easy deployment and ongoing management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Securing your traffic with Cloud Armor&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Armor is Google’s best in class DDoS defense solution and Web Application Firewall (WAF). You can rest easier knowing that Google’s network has your back. We have a long history of mitigating some of the most complicated and largest DDoS attacks on record ( blog link). With Cloud Armor you can additionally take advantage of preconfigured WAF rules (Mod Security Rule Set 3.02), adaptive protection, and recently rate limiting. All of this ensures that your website stays online and is protected from attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Caching static content with Cloud CDN&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For content that is cacheable like images or short videos, you can use Cloud CDN to enable fast and cost efficient delivery. Google has Cloud CDN pops all over the world which will help ensure that users from the regions that matter to you have a seamless and fast experience. Cloud CDN is easy to enable and get started with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Youtube video&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to see a further overview of the architecture and components of this solution as well as a detailed configuration walkthrough please check out this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5qLiG0vIGE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on any of these solutions please check out their respective documentation hubs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/domains/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Cloud Domains&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/overview/&#34;&gt;Cloud DNS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-groups&#34;&gt;Managed Instance Group&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs&#34;&gt;Cloud Storage&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https&#34;&gt;External HTTPs Load Balancer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/armor/docs&#34;&gt;Cloud Armor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Cloud CDN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/networking/cloud-domains-is-generally-available/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/google_domain.max-500x500.jpg&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;Cloud Domains, now GA, makes it easy to register and manage custom domains&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;Cloud Domains, now generally available, makes performing domain-related tasks in Google Cloud simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

      <title>Introducing Anthos for VMs and tools to simplify the developer experience</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/hybrid-cloud/introducing-anthos-for-vms-and-other-app-modernization-tools/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to software development using Google Cloud, we have three guiding principles. First, developing on Google Cloud needs to be open—we rely heavily on open-source technologies so that it&#39;s easier to move apps between environments, recruit skilled developers, and access the latest innovations sooner. Second, developing for Google Cloud should also be easy—we strive to offer intuitive, integrated tools that run well wherever you build your code, while minimizing your operational overhead. Finally, running on Google Cloud should be transformative—we offer services that help unleash your imagination, along with best practices and professional services to help you bring your ideas to life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, at &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Next ‘21&lt;/a&gt;, we announced a variety of new tools and capabilities to deliver on those principles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Opening Anthos to virtual machines &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since announcing Anthos, our open-source-based platform for hybrid and mutlicloud deployments in 2018, we have continued to receive strong reception from customers and partners. In fact, in Q2 2021, Anthos compute under management grew more than 500% year-over-year. Anthos unifies the management of infrastructure and applications across on-premises, edge, and multiple public clouds, as well as ensuring consistent operation at scale. Based on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Anthos was originally designed to run applications in containers. To help you make that transition, we automated the process to migrate and modernize existing apps using &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/migrate/anthos&#34;&gt;Migrate for Anthos and GKE&lt;/a&gt; from various virtual machine environments to containers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we have seen many customers make the leap to containerization, some are not quite ready to move completely off of virtual machines (VMs). They want a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in both containers and VMs in a common, shared environment. Today, we are announcing &lt;a href=&#34;http://cloud.google.com/anthos&#34;&gt;Anthos for Virtual Machines&lt;/a&gt; in preview, allowing you to standardize on Kubernetes while continuing to run some workloads that cannot be easily containerized in virtual machines. Anthos for VMs will help platform developers standardize on an operation model, process and tooling; enable incremental modernization efforts; and support traditional workloads like Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) or stateful monolithic workloads. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can take advantage of Anthos for VMs in two ways – either by attaching your vSphere VMs, or shifting your VMs as-is. For customers with active VMware environments, the Anthos control plane can now connect to your vSphere environment and attach your vSphere VMs, allowing you to apply consistent security and policies across clusters, gain visibility into the health and performance of your services, and manage traffic for both VMs and containers. Alternately, Anthos for VMs allows you to shift VMs as-is onto Anthos with &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubevirt.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;KubeVirt&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source virtualization API for Kubernetes. Now you can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in both application containers as well as VMs on a common, shared Anthos environment. This is a great option for organizations that prefer to use open-source virtualization, as those same organizations often prefer to run &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal/1.6/concepts/about-bare-metal&#34;&gt;Anthos on bare metal&lt;/a&gt;. To help get started, we provide you with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos&#34;&gt;fit assessment tool&lt;/a&gt; to identify which approach to take. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Taking your Anthos experience further&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re also making it easier for you to manage containerized workloads already running in other clouds through Anthos. While you can already run containers in AWS and Azure from Anthos, we’re taking this a step further with the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/multi-cloud&#34;&gt;Anthos Multi-Cloud API&lt;/a&gt;. Generally available in Q4 ‘21, this new API lets you provision and manage GKE clusters running on AWS or Azure infrastructure directly from the command line interface or the Google Cloud Console, all while being managed by a central control plane. This gives you a single API to manage all your container deployments regardless of which major public cloud you&#39;re using, thus minimizing the time you spend jumping between user interfaces to accomplish day-to-day management tasks like creating, managing, and updating clusters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we’ve brought some of the innovations originally developed for hybrid and multicloud use cases in Anthos back to GKE running in Google Cloud. Specifically, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/config-management&#34;&gt;Anthos Config Management&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/service-mesh&#34;&gt;Anthos Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt; are now generally available for GKE as standalone services with pay-as-you-go pricing. GKE customers can now use Anthos Config Management to take advantage of config and policy automation at a low incremental per-cluster cost, and use Anthos Service Mesh to enable next-level security and networking on container-based microservices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we are excited to announce that starting today, Anthos Service Mesh is generally available to support a hybrid mesh. This gives you the flexibility to have a common mesh that spans both your Google Cloud and on-prem deployments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.westerndigital.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Western Digital&lt;/a&gt; have already experienced many benefits from adopting Anthos as their application modernization platform:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#34;As a global storage leader with sophisticated manufacturing facilities around the world, Western Digital sees cloud technology as an enabler of our key business priorities: reducing time to deliver products and services, rationalizing our entire application footprint, and meeting customer demand for IoT and edge applications,”&lt;/i&gt; said Jahidul Khandaker, senior vice president and CIO, Western Digital. &lt;i&gt;“Anthos is our unified management platform of choice—it gives us insights across our Google Cloud and on-premises environments, while keeping the doors open for a multi-cloud future. Anthos has delivered several advantages for our developers: a richer user experience, greater security, and enhanced flexibility to manage factory applications—no matter where they reside—on-prem, in the cloud or a mix of both.&#34;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Easy does it&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being an open platform, we strive to make Google Cloud easy to use for operators as well as developers. For example, earlier this year &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-gke-autopilot&#34;&gt;we introduced GKE Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;, a mode of operations in GKE that empowers you to simplify operations by offloading the management of infrastructure, control plane, and nodes. With GKE Autopilot, customers like &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/customers/ubie&#34;&gt;Ubie&lt;/a&gt;, a Japanese-based healthcare technology company, have eliminated the need to configure and maintain infrastructure, which helped their development teams focus on making healthcare more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Cloud Run, our serverless compute platform, you can abstract away infrastructure management entirely. This year, our focus has been on bringing the simplicity of Cloud Run to more workloads, like traditional applications written in Java Spring Boot, ASP.NET, and Django, among others. Along with a new second generation execution environment for enhanced network and CPU performance, we’ve added &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/introducing-committed-use-discounts-for-cloud-run&#34;&gt;committed-use discounts&lt;/a&gt; and introduced &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-run-gets-always-on-cpu-allocation&#34;&gt;new CPU allocation controls and price&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to save up to 17% and 25%, respectively, on your compute bill. New &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/introducing-new-connectors-workflows&#34;&gt;connectors&lt;/a&gt; for Workflows, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-functions-integrates-with-google-secret-manager&#34;&gt;integration&lt;/a&gt; between Cloud Functions and Secret Manager, and support for &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-functions-supports-min-instances&#34;&gt;min instances&lt;/a&gt; are just a few of the other ways we’ve made it easier to build modern, serverless apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Easy for developers &lt;/h3&gt;Developers spend a lot of time inside their integrated development environments (IDEs), writing code. Last year we announced &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/shell&#34;&gt;Cloud Shell Editor&lt;/a&gt;, which makes the process of writing code as seamless as possible. It comes with your favorite developer tools (e.g., docker, minikube, skaffold, and many more) preinstalled, and this year, we added ~100 live tutorials to it—no more switching between the documentation, the terminal, and your code! &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once that code is ready, you want building it and deploying it to be as seamless as possible. Today we are announcing &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/hybrid/overview&#34;&gt;Cloud Build Hybrid&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you build, test, and deploy across clouds and on-prem systems, so developers get consistent CI/CD tooling across their environments, and platform engineers don&#39;t have to worry about maintaining and scaling their systems. Cloud Build is also integrated with &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z4vYdjF66UTOJgIpaDlDnXOuDCV6YulMhvNDjgoFiYo/edit?resourcekey=0-Vxxrly14dbfaBHg21HnOfg#&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Artifact Registry&lt;/a&gt;, which now allows you to store not only in containers, but also language-specific artifacts in one place. Finally, with the recently launched &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt;, which is a managed, continuous delivery service initially for GKE, we’re making it easy to scale your pipelines across your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Easy for operators&lt;/h3&gt;When your applications are up and running, you need to observe and analyze them for better operations and business insights. While we already offer a fully managed metrics and alerting service with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/monitoring&#34;&gt;Cloud Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;, some Kubernetes users want to continue using open-source Prometheus without the scaling and management headaches. This is precisely why today we are announcing the preview of &lt;a href=&#34;http://cloud.google.com/monitoring&#34;&gt;Managed Service for Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;, helping you avoid vendor lock-in and delivering compatibility with your existing Prometheus alerts, workflows, and Grafana dashboards. Now you have all of the benefits of Prometheus, minus the management hassle. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give you easy diagnostics and deeper insights from across your business and systems, today we also combined &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging&#34;&gt;Cloud Logging&lt;/a&gt; with the performance and power of BigQuery to introduce &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/log-analytics&#34;&gt;Log Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. Currently in preview, Log Analytics allows you to rapidly store, manage, and analyze log data. This enables you to effectively move your operations from a reactive to proactive model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Zero-trust simplified for application developers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also make it easy for developers to build secure applications from the get-go, whether they’re writing code, running it through the CI/CD pipeline, or in production. This zero-trust software supply chain is made possible by fully managed services that provide you with a consistent way to define and enforce policy, establish provenance, and prevent modification or tampering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we’re continuing to enhance our &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/applying-zero-trust-to-user-access-and-production-services&#34;&gt;zero-trust software supply chain capabilities&lt;/a&gt; with new features. For example, developers can now scan &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/scan-for-vulnerabilities-early-to-shift-security-left-in-cicd&#34;&gt;containers for vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; using the simple “gcloud artifacts docker images scan” command. Now generally available, we’re also announcing that you can pair Cloud Run with Binary Authorization and, in a few clicks, ensure that only trusted container images make it to production. In addition, Binary Authorization now integrates with Cloud Build to automatically generate digital signatures and make it easy to set up deploy-time constraints that ensure only images signed by Cloud Build are sanctioned. Learn more about how we are making security easier &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/next21-how-google-cloud-secures-the-world&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Transform your cloud with Google&lt;/h3&gt;No matter where you are along the journey to transform your applications, we are here to partner with you. Whether its with the new product functionality we described today at Next, research and best practices such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/&#34;&gt;2021 Accelerate State of DevOps report&lt;/a&gt; from Cloud’s DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team, or professional services such as the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/camp&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Application Modernization Program (CAMP)&lt;/a&gt;, we’re here to help.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

Anthos unifies the management of infrastructure and applications across on-premises, edge, and multiple public clouds, as well as ensuring consistent operation at scale. Based on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Anthos was originally designed to run applications in containers. To help you make that transition, we automated the process to migrate and modernize existing apps using &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/migrate/anthos&#34;&gt;Migrate for Anthos and GKE&lt;/a&gt; from various virtual machine environments to containers.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we have seen many customers make the leap to containerization, some are not quite ready to move completely off of virtual machines (VMs). They want a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in both containers and VMs in a common, shared environment. Today, we are announcing &lt;a href=&#34;http://cloud.google.com/anthos&#34;&gt;Anthos for Virtual Machines&lt;/a&gt; in preview, allowing you to standardize on Kubernetes while continuing to run some workloads that cannot be easily containerized in virtual machines. Anthos for VMs will help platform developers standardize on an operation model, process and tooling; enable incremental modernization efforts; and support traditional workloads like Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) or stateful monolithic workloads.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can take advantage of Anthos for VMs in two ways &amp;#8211; either by attaching your vSphere VMs, or shifting your VMs as-is. For customers with active VMware environments, the Anthos control plane can now connect to your vSphere environment and attach your vSphere VMs, allowing you to apply consistent security and policies across clusters, gain visibility into the health and performance of your services, and manage traffic for both VMs and containers. Alternately, Anthos for VMs allows you to shift VMs as-is onto Anthos with &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubevirt.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;KubeVirt&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source virtualization API for Kubernetes. Now you can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in both application containers as well as VMs on a common, shared Anthos environment. This is a great option for organizations that prefer to use open-source virtualization, as those same organizations often prefer to run &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal/1.6/concepts/about-bare-metal&#34;&gt;Anthos on bare metal&lt;/a&gt;. To help get started, we provide you with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos&#34;&gt;fit assessment tool&lt;/a&gt; to identify which approach to take.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Taking your Anthos experience further&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re also making it easier for you to manage containerized workloads already running in other clouds through Anthos. While you can already run containers in AWS and Azure from Anthos, we&amp;#8217;re taking this a step further with the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/multi-cloud&#34;&gt;Anthos Multi-Cloud API&lt;/a&gt;. Generally available in Q4 &amp;#8216;21, this new API lets you provision and manage GKE clusters running on AWS or Azure infrastructure directly from the command line interface or the Google Cloud Console, all while being managed by a central control plane. This gives you a single API to manage all your container deployments regardless of which major public cloud you&#39;re using, thus minimizing the time you spend jumping between user interfaces to accomplish day-to-day management tasks like creating, managing, and updating clusters.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, we&amp;#8217;ve brought some of the innovations originally developed for hybrid and multicloud use cases in Anthos back to GKE running in Google Cloud. Specifically, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/config-management&#34;&gt;Anthos Config Management&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/service-mesh&#34;&gt;Anthos Service Mesh&lt;/a&gt; are now generally available for GKE as standalone services with pay-as-you-go pricing. GKE customers can now use Anthos Config Management to take advantage of config and policy automation at a low incremental per-cluster cost, and use Anthos Service Mesh to enable next-level security and networking on container-based microservices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, we are excited to announce that starting today, Anthos Service Mesh is generally available to support a hybrid mesh. This gives you the flexibility to have a common mesh that spans both your Google Cloud and on-prem deployments.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.westerndigital.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Western Digital&lt;/a&gt; have already experienced many benefits from adopting Anthos as their application modernization platform:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;#34;As a global storage leader with sophisticated manufacturing facilities around the world, Western Digital sees cloud technology as an enabler of our key business priorities: reducing time to deliver products and services, rationalizing our entire application footprint, and meeting customer demand for IoT and edge applications,&amp;#8221;&lt;/i&gt; said Jahidul Khandaker, senior vice president and CIO, Western Digital. &lt;i&gt;&amp;#8220;Anthos is our unified management platform of choice&amp;#8212;it gives us insights across our Google Cloud and on-premises environments, while keeping the doors open for a multi-cloud future. Anthos has delivered several advantages for our developers: a richer user experience, greater security, and enhanced flexibility to manage factory applications&amp;#8212;no matter where they reside&amp;#8212;on-prem, in the cloud or a mix of both.&amp;#34;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Easy does it&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to being an open platform, we strive to make Google Cloud easy to use for operators as well as developers. For example, earlier this year&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-gke-autopilot&#34;&gt;we introduced GKE Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;, a mode of operations in GKE that empowers you to simplify operations by offloading the management of infrastructure, control plane, and nodes. With GKE Autopilot, customers like&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/customers/ubie&#34;&gt;Ubie&lt;/a&gt;, a Japanese-based healthcare technology company, have eliminated the need to configure and maintain infrastructure, which helped their development teams focus on making healthcare more accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Cloud Run, our serverless compute platform, you can abstract away infrastructure management entirely. This year, our focus has been on bringing the simplicity of Cloud Run to more workloads, like traditional applications written in Java Spring Boot, ASP.NET, and Django, among others. Along with a new second generation execution environment for enhanced network and CPU performance, we&amp;#8217;ve added&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/introducing-committed-use-discounts-for-cloud-run&#34;&gt;committed-use discounts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;and introduced&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-run-gets-always-on-cpu-allocation&#34;&gt;new CPU allocation controls and price&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to save up to 17% and 25%, respectively, on your compute bill. New&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/introducing-new-connectors-workflows&#34;&gt;connectors&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;for Workflows,&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-functions-integrates-with-google-secret-manager&#34;&gt;integration&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;between Cloud Functions and Secret Manager, and support for&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-functions-supports-min-instances&#34;&gt;min instances&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;are just a few of the other ways we&amp;#8217;ve made it easier to build modern, serverless apps.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Easy for developers&amp;#160;&lt;/h3&gt;Developers spend a lot of time inside their integrated development environments (IDEs), writing code. Last year we announced&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/shell&#34;&gt;Cloud Shell Editor&lt;/a&gt;, which makes the process of writing code as seamless as possible. It comes with your favorite developer tools (e.g., docker, minikube, skaffold, and many more) preinstalled, and this year, we added ~100 live tutorials to it&amp;#8212;no more switching between the documentation, the terminal, and your code!&amp;#160;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once that code is ready, you want building it and deploying it to be as seamless as possible. Today we are announcing&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/hybrid/overview&#34;&gt;Cloud Build Hybrid&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you build, test, and deploy across clouds and on-prem systems, so developers get consistent CI/CD tooling across their environments, and platform engineers don&#39;t have to worry about maintaining and scaling their systems. Cloud Build is also integrated with&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z4vYdjF66UTOJgIpaDlDnXOuDCV6YulMhvNDjgoFiYo/edit?resourcekey=0-Vxxrly14dbfaBHg21HnOfg#&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Artifact Registry&lt;/a&gt;, which now allows you to store not only in containers, but also language-specific artifacts in one place. Finally, with the recently launched&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt;, which is a managed, continuous delivery service initially for GKE, we&amp;#8217;re making it easy to scale your pipelines across your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Easy for operators&lt;/h3&gt;When your applications are up and running, you need to observe and analyze them for better operations and business insights. While we already offer a fully managed metrics and alerting service with&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/monitoring&#34;&gt;Cloud Monitoring&lt;/a&gt;, some Kubernetes users want to continue using open-source Prometheus without the scaling and management headaches. This is precisely why today we are announcing the preview of&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;http://cloud.google.com/monitoring&#34;&gt;Managed Service for Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;, helping you avoid vendor lock-in and delivering compatibility with your existing Prometheus alerts, workflows, and Grafana dashboards. Now you have all of the benefits of Prometheus, minus the management hassle.&amp;#160;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give you easy diagnostics and deeper insights from across your business and systems, today we also combined&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging&#34;&gt;Cloud Logging&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;with the performance and power of BigQuery to introduce&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/log-analytics&#34;&gt;Log Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. Currently in preview, Log Analytics allows you to rapidly store, manage, and analyze log data. This enables you to effectively move your operations from a reactive to proactive model.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Zero-trust simplified for application developers&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also make it easy for developers to build secure applications from the get-go, whether they&amp;#8217;re writing code, running it through the CI/CD pipeline, or in production. This zero-trust software supply chain is made possible by fully managed services that provide you with a consistent way to define and enforce policy, establish provenance, and prevent modification or tampering.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we&amp;#8217;re continuing to enhance our&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/applying-zero-trust-to-user-access-and-production-services&#34;&gt;zero-trust software supply chain capabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;with new features. For example, developers can now scan&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/scan-for-vulnerabilities-early-to-shift-security-left-in-cicd&#34;&gt;containers for vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;using the simple &amp;#8220;gcloud artifacts docker images scan&amp;#8221; command. Now generally available, we&amp;#8217;re also announcing that you can pair Cloud Run with Binary Authorization and, in a few clicks, ensure that only trusted container images make it to production. In addition, Binary Authorization now integrates with Cloud Build to automatically generate digital signatures and make it easy to set up deploy-time constraints that ensure only images signed by Cloud Build are sanctioned.

Whether its with the new product functionality we described today at Next, research and best practices such as the&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/&#34;&gt;2021 Accelerate State of DevOps report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#160;from Cloud&amp;#8217;s DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team, or professional services such as the&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/camp&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Application Modernization Program (CAMP)&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#8217;re here to help.&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" _nghost-c20=""><p>When it comes to software development using Google Cloud, we have three guiding principles. First, developing on Google Cloud needs to be open—we rely heavily on open-source technologies so that it&#39;s easier to move apps between environments, recruit skilled developers, and access the latest innovations sooner. Second, developing for Google Cloud should also be easy—we strive to offer intuitive, integrated tools that run well wherever you build your code, while minimizing your operational overhead. Finally, running on Google Cloud should be transformative—we offer services that help unleash your imagination, along with best practices and professional services to help you bring your ideas to life. </p><p>Today, at <a href="https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="1" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://cloud.withgoogle.com" track-metadata-module="post">Google Cloud Next ‘21</a>, we announced a variety of new tools and capabilities to deliver on those principles. </p><h3>Opening Anthos to virtual machines </h3><p>Since announcing Anthos, our open-source-based platform for hybrid and mutlicloud deployments in 2018, we have continued to receive strong reception from customers and partners.

By using the same formats and tools as you would in the open-source ecosystem, you can leverage the same advantages, simplify your build, and keep your business logic and applications secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Language repository formats, now generally available&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of today, support for language repositories in &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/&#34;&gt;Artifact Registry is now generally available&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to store all your language-specific artifacts in one place. Supported package types include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/java&#34;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt; packages  (using the Maven repository format)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/nodejs&#34;&gt;Node.js&lt;/a&gt; packages (using the npm repository format)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/python&#34;&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt; packages (using the PyPI repository format)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;OS repository formats in preview&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, support for new repository formats for Linux distributions is in public preview, allowing developers to create private internal-only packages and securely use them across multiple applications deployed to Linux environments. New supported artifact formats include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/os-packages/debian&#34;&gt;Debian&lt;/a&gt; packages (using the Apt repository format)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/os-packages/rpm&#34;&gt;RPM&lt;/a&gt; packages (using the Yum repository format)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is in addition to existing container images and Helm charts (using the Docker repository format). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your own secure supply chain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storing your packages in Artifact Registry not only enables code reuse, but also simplifies and secures your existing build pipeline. In addition to bringing your internal packages to a managed repository, using Artifact Registry also allows you to take additional steps to improve the security of your software delivery pipeline:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/docs/container-scanning-overview&#34;&gt;Container Analysis&lt;/a&gt; to scan containers that use your private packages for vulnerabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Include your repositories in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/vpc&#34;&gt;Virtual Private Cloud&lt;/a&gt; to control access&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Monitor repository usage with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/audit&#34;&gt;Cloud Audit Logs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/binauthz-attestation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;binauthz-attestation&lt;/a&gt; builder with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/build&#34;&gt;Cloud Build&lt;/a&gt; to create attestations that &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization&#34;&gt;Binary Authorization&lt;/a&gt; verifies before allowing container deployment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use  Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) for &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control&#34;&gt;repository access control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Seamless authentication&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With credential helpers to authenticate access for installers based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/iam&#34;&gt;Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM)&lt;/a&gt; permissions, using Artifact Registry to host your packages makes authentication to private repositories easy. By managing IAM groups, administrators can control access to repositories via the same tools used across Google Cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Regional repositories lower cost and enable data compliance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artifact Registry provides &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/repo-locations&#34;&gt;regional support&lt;/a&gt;, enabling you to manage and host artifacts in the regions where your deployments occur, reducing latency and cost. By implementing regional repositories, you can also comply with your local data sovereignty and security requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get started today&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These repository formats are now generally available to all Artifact Registry customers.

      <title>Deploy Anthos on GKE with Terraform Part 3: Enabling Cloud Resources Provisioning</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/using-terraform-to-enable-config-connector-on-a-gke-cluster/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the previous two parts of the series (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/using-terraform-to-enable-config-sync-on-a-gke-cluster&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/using-terraform-to-enable-policy-controller-on-a-gke-cluster&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;) we discussed how new features in &lt;a href=&#34;https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform Provider for GCP&lt;/a&gt; make it easier for platform administrators to extend their Terraform automation to add &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/config-management&#34;&gt;Anthos Config Management (ACM)&lt;/a&gt; features to their GKE clusters. Using familiar Terraform resource syntax, you can add &lt;code&gt;google_gke_hub_feature&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;google_gke_hub_feature_membership&lt;/code&gt; resource with &lt;code&gt;configmanagement&lt;/code&gt; section to enable Config Sync for GitOps integration and &lt;code&gt;policy_controller&lt;/code&gt; section for policy validation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far the cluster in our example was only used to host the configuration consisting of Kubernetes native resources - containerized Wordpress application powered by in-cluster MySQL database. We are getting all the advantages of Kubernetes: continuous &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/concepts/reconciliation&#34;&gt;reconciliation&lt;/a&gt; and drift correction, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;eventual consistency,&lt;/a&gt; order independence and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;idempotence&lt;/a&gt;. We are also deriving benefits from GitOps approach using the repo as the source of truth, enabling reviewable and version-controlled workflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let’s take it even further. &lt;b&gt;We’ll demonstrate how&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/build-platform-krm-part-1-whats-platform&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;the same model&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b&gt;can be expanded to create and manage not just native Kubernetes resources (Kubernetes service accounts, pods, deployments) but also GCP cloud resources - Cloud databases, storage buckets, VM instances and&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/overview&#34;&gt;many other GCP resources&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Config Connector&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/config-connector-bridges-kubernetes-gcp-resources&#34;&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in 2020, many Kuberentes shops have embraced its convenient way of managing GCP resources. Now that we have enabled Terraform support for Anthos features, combined with a Terraform configuration &lt;a href=&#34;https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/container_cluster#config_connector_config&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;option&lt;/a&gt; to install Config Connector on the cluster,  the full GitOps workflow and Kubernetes lifecycle spanning native and cloud resources can be enabled during cluster creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine/blob/master/examples/acm-terraform-blog-part3/terraform/gke.tf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;, we are enabling Config Connector using the &lt;code&gt;config_connector&lt;/code&gt; setting in the &lt;code&gt;gke&lt;/code&gt; Terraform module. We also use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;workload-identity&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; module to create a GCP service account that will be used to make the changes to K8s resources and bind it to Kubernetes Service Account (&lt;code&gt;cnrm-controller-manager&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;cnrm-system namespace&lt;/code&gt;). You can choose the appropriate permissions to GCP service account -  in our examples we are giving it the &lt;code&gt;owner&lt;/code&gt; role for simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s review what changed in this part in the repo that is synchronized with our cluster via Config Sync. In  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine/tree/master/examples/acm-terraform-blog-part1/config-root&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the first part&lt;/a&gt;, we added a collection of configs, all native Kubernetes objects. These configs provisioned an in-cluster Wordpress application with an in-cluster MySQL database. In the second part, we added a set of rules used by PolicyController to audit our cluster. In this part, we start by  adding a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine/blob/master/examples/acm-terraform-blog-part3/config-root/configconnector.yaml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;config&lt;/a&gt; representing an instance of the Config Connector addon. While the addon is enabled on the cluster, this config instance is required to activate it. It specifies the settings, such as &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; (cluster or namespace) and GCP service account, linking it to the cnrmsa account that we created above using the &lt;code&gt;workload-identity&lt;/code&gt; module.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now we can create GCP resources in addition to in-cluster native resources directly in our K8s configuration. We are configuring an &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/sql/sqldatabase&#34;&gt;SQLDatabase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/sql/sqlinstance&#34;&gt;SQLInstance&lt;/a&gt; resources:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/sql/sqluser&#34;&gt;SQLUser&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/iam/iampolicy&#34;&gt;IAMPolicy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/resource-docs/iam/iampolicymember&#34;&gt;IAMPolicyMember&lt;/a&gt; (see complete example &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine/blob/master/examples/acm-terraform-blog-part3/config-root/wordpress-bundle.yaml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Overall, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/overview&#34;&gt;more than 130 resources are now supported with Config Connector&lt;/a&gt; covering many of the most popular GCP configuration patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will notice that this configuration is expanded and parameterized for our specific project. How did we specify the parameter values? While many tools can be used, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://helm.sh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://kustomize.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kustomize&lt;/a&gt; and some of them used together, we recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/architecture/managing-cloud-infrastructure-using-kpt&#34;&gt;Kpt&lt;/a&gt; that fully embraces the principles of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/understanding-configuration-as-data-in-kubernetes&#34;&gt;configuration-as-data&lt;/a&gt;. In this example we used set-project-id kpt function to specify project id on the config-root directory before submitting the change to Git.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine/tree/master/examples/acm-terraform-blog-part3&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; provides a complete example of provisioning a cluster that is synchronized with a repo that contains a WordPress configuration powered, this time, by GCP MySQL database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was the third and the final article of the three part series that showcased Terraform support for ACM features and how it simplifies cluster provisioning for platform administrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/topics/anthos/using-terraform-to-enable-config-sync-on-a-gke-cluster/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Anthos.max-500x500.png&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;Deploy Anthos on GKE with Terraform part 1: GitOps with Config Sync&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;It is now simple to use Terraform to configure Anthos features on your GKE clusters.

      <title>Introducing Google Cloud Deploy: Managed continuous delivery to GKE</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/google-cloud-deploy-automates-deploys-to-gke/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is frequently top-of-mind for organizations adopting &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/a&gt; (GKE). However, continuous delivery —deploying container image artifacts into your various environments—remains complex, particularly in Kubernetes environments. With little in the way of accepted best practices, building and scaling continuous delivery tooling, pipelines, and repeatable processes is hard work that requires a lot of on-the-job experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way. &lt;/p&gt;Today, we are pleased to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt;, a managed, opinionated continuous delivery service that makes continuous delivery to GKE easier, faster, and more reliable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 2.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solving for continuous delivery challenges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy is the product of discussions with more than 50 customers to better understand the challenges they face doing continuous delivery to GKE. From cloud-native to more traditional businesses, three themes consistently emerged: cost of ownership, security and audit, and integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a deeper look at these challenges and how we address them with Google Cloud Deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost of ownership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time and again we heard that the operational cost of Kubernetes continuous delivery is high. Identifying best and repeatable practices, scaling delivery tooling and pipelines, and staying current—to say nothing of maintenance—is resource-intensive and takes time away from the core business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We can’t afford to be innovating in continuous delivery,” one customer told us. “We want an opinionated product that supports best practices out of the box.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy addresses cost of ownership head-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a managed service, Google Cloud Deploy eliminates the scaling and maintenance responsibilities that typically come with self-managed continuous delivery solutions. Now you can reclaim the time spent maintaining your continuous delivery tooling and spend it delivering value to your customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy also provides structure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#delivery_pipeline&#34;&gt;Delivery pipelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology&#34;&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; are defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/config-files&#34;&gt;declaratively&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/pipeline-instances&#34;&gt;stored alongside each release&lt;/a&gt;. That means if your delivery pipeline changes, the release’s path to production remains durable.

To help, Google Cloud Deploy  leverages &lt;a href=&#34;https://skaffold.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skaffold&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/skaffold&#34;&gt;standardize your configuration&lt;/a&gt; between development and production environments. Organizations new to Kubernetes typically deploy using raw manifests, but as they become more sophisticated, may want to use more advanced tooling (&lt;a href=&#34;https://helm.sh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kustomize.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kustomize&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kpt.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kpt&lt;/a&gt;). The combination of Google Cloud Deploy and Skaffold lets you transition to these tools without impacting your delivery pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to facilitate other integrations, such as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_automated_testing&#34;&gt;post-deployment test execution&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_third-party_workflow_management&#34;&gt;third party approval workflows&lt;/a&gt;, Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/subscribe-deploy-notifications&#34;&gt;emits Pub/Sub messages&lt;/a&gt; throughout a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/architecture#how_they_fit_together_to_deliver_your_release&#34;&gt;release’s lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive, easy-to-use, and cost-effective DevOps tools are key to building an efficient software development team, and it’s our hope that Google Cloud Deploy will help you complete your CI/CD pipelines.

      <title>Introducing Google Cloud Deploy: Managed continuous delivery to GKE</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/google-cloud-deploy-automates-deploys-to-gke/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is frequently top-of-mind for organizations adopting &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/a&gt; (GKE). However, continuous delivery —deploying container image artifacts into your various environments—remains complex, particularly in Kubernetes environments. With little in the way of accepted best practices, building and scaling continuous delivery tooling, pipelines, and repeatable processes is hard work that requires a lot of on-the-job experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way. &lt;/p&gt;Today, we are pleased to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt;, a managed, opinionated continuous delivery service that makes continuous delivery to GKE easier, faster, and more reliable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 2.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solving for continuous delivery challenges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy is the product of discussions with more than 50 customers to better understand the challenges they face doing continuous delivery to GKE. From cloud-native to more traditional businesses, three themes consistently emerged: cost of ownership, security and audit, and integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a deeper look at these challenges and how we address them with Google Cloud Deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost of ownership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time and again we heard that the operational cost of Kubernetes continuous delivery is high. Identifying best and repeatable practices, scaling delivery tooling and pipelines, and staying current—to say nothing of maintenance—is resource-intensive and takes time away from the core business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We can’t afford to be innovating in continuous delivery,” one customer told us. “We want an opinionated product that supports best practices out of the box.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy addresses cost of ownership head-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a managed service, Google Cloud Deploy eliminates the scaling and maintenance responsibilities that typically come with self-managed continuous delivery solutions. Now you can reclaim the time spent maintaining your continuous delivery tooling and spend it delivering value to your customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy also provides structure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#delivery_pipeline&#34;&gt;Delivery pipelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology&#34;&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; are defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/config-files&#34;&gt;declaratively&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/pipeline-instances&#34;&gt;stored alongside each release&lt;/a&gt;. That means if your delivery pipeline changes, the release’s path to production remains durable. No more time lost troubleshooting issues on in-flight releases caused by changes made to the delivery pipeline.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy GIF&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have found that a variety of GKE roles and personas interact with continuous delivery processes. A DevOps engineer may be focused on release &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploying-application&#34;&gt;promotion and rollback&lt;/a&gt; decisions, while a business decision maker thinks about delivery pipeline health and velocity. Google Cloud Deploy’s user experience keeps these multiple perspectives in mind, making it easier for various personas to perform contextualized reviews and make decisions, improving efficiency and reducing cost of ownership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;Contextualized deployment approvals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security and audit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of different users interact with a continuous delivery system, making a variety of decisions.

      <title>Introducing Google Cloud Deploy: Managed continuous delivery to GKE</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/google-cloud-deploy-automates-deploys-to-gke/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is frequently top-of-mind for organizations adopting &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/a&gt; (GKE). However, continuous delivery —deploying container image artifacts into your various environments—remains complex, particularly in Kubernetes environments. With little in the way of accepted best practices, building and scaling continuous delivery tooling, pipelines, and repeatable processes is hard work that requires a lot of on-the-job experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way. &lt;/p&gt;Today, we are pleased to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt;, a managed, opinionated continuous delivery service that makes continuous delivery to GKE easier, faster, and more reliable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 2.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solving for continuous delivery challenges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy is the product of discussions with more than 50 customers to better understand the challenges they face doing continuous delivery to GKE. From cloud-native to more traditional businesses, three themes consistently emerged: cost of ownership, security and audit, and integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a deeper look at these challenges and how we address them with Google Cloud Deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost of ownership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time and again we heard that the operational cost of Kubernetes continuous delivery is high. Identifying best and repeatable practices, scaling delivery tooling and pipelines, and staying current—to say nothing of maintenance—is resource-intensive and takes time away from the core business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We can’t afford to be innovating in continuous delivery,” one customer told us. “We want an opinionated product that supports best practices out of the box.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy addresses cost of ownership head-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a managed service, Google Cloud Deploy eliminates the scaling and maintenance responsibilities that typically come with self-managed continuous delivery solutions. Now you can reclaim the time spent maintaining your continuous delivery tooling and spend it delivering value to your customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy also provides structure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#delivery_pipeline&#34;&gt;Delivery pipelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology&#34;&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; are defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/config-files&#34;&gt;declaratively&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/pipeline-instances&#34;&gt;stored alongside each release&lt;/a&gt;. That means if your delivery pipeline changes, the release’s path to production remains durable. No more time lost troubleshooting issues on in-flight releases caused by changes made to the delivery pipeline.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy GIF&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have found that a variety of GKE roles and personas interact with continuous delivery processes. A DevOps engineer may be focused on release &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploying-application&#34;&gt;promotion and rollback&lt;/a&gt; decisions, while a business decision maker thinks about delivery pipeline health and velocity. Google Cloud Deploy’s user experience keeps these multiple perspectives in mind, making it easier for various personas to perform contextualized reviews and make decisions, improving efficiency and reducing cost of ownership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;Contextualized deployment approvals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security and audit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of different users interact with a continuous delivery system, making a variety of decisions. Not all users and decisions carry the same authority, however. Being able to define a delivery pipeline and make updates doesn’t always mean you can create releases, for example, nor does being able to promote a release to staging mean you can approve it to production. Modern continuous delivery is full of security and audit considerations. Restricting who can access what, where, and how is necessary to maintain release integrity and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Google Cloud Deploy enables fine-grained restriction, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/iam-roles-permissions&#34;&gt;discrete resource access control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/execution-environment&#34;&gt;execution-level security&lt;/a&gt;. For additional safeguards against unwanted approvals, you can also take advantage of flow management features such as release promotion, rollback, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/managing-delivery-pipeline#requiring_approval&#34;&gt;approvals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auditing with Google Cloud Deploy works just like it does for other Google Cloud services. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/audit-logs&#34;&gt;Cloud Audit Logs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/audit-logs&#34;&gt;audits&lt;/a&gt; user-invoked Google Cloud Deploy activities, providing centralized awareness into who promoted a specific release or made an update to a delivery pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you already have continuous delivery capabilities, you likely already have continuous integration (CI), approval and/or operation workflows, and other systems that intersect with your software delivery practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating&#34;&gt;embraces the GKE delivery tooling ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; in three ways: connectivity to CI systems, support for leading configuration (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#render&#34;&gt;rendering&lt;/a&gt;) tooling, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub&#34;&gt;Pub/Sub&lt;/a&gt; notifications to enable third-party integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_your_ci_system&#34;&gt;Connecting Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt; to existing CI tools is straightforward. After you build your containers, Google Cloud Deploy creates a delivery pipeline release that initiates the Kubernetes manifest configuration (render) and deployment process to the first environment in a progression sequence. Whether you are using Jenkins, Cloud Build, or another CI tool, this is usually a simple &lt;i&gt;`&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;gcloud beta deploy releases create`.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deployt_3_efyUGIq.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 3.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deployt_3_efyUGIq.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivering to Kubernetes often changes over time. To help, Google Cloud Deploy  leverages &lt;a href=&#34;https://skaffold.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skaffold&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/skaffold&#34;&gt;standardize your configuration&lt;/a&gt; between development and production environments. Organizations new to Kubernetes typically deploy using raw manifests, but as they become more sophisticated, may want to use more advanced tooling (&lt;a href=&#34;https://helm.sh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kustomize.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kustomize&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kpt.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kpt&lt;/a&gt;). The combination of Google Cloud Deploy and Skaffold lets you transition to these tools without impacting your delivery pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to facilitate other integrations, such as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_automated_testing&#34;&gt;post-deployment test execution&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_third-party_workflow_management&#34;&gt;third party approval workflows&lt;/a&gt;, Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/subscribe-deploy-notifications&#34;&gt;emits Pub/Sub messages&lt;/a&gt; throughout a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/architecture#how_they_fit_together_to_deliver_your_release&#34;&gt;release’s lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive, easy-to-use, and cost-effective DevOps tools are key to building an efficient software development team, and it’s our hope that Google Cloud Deploy will help you complete your CI/CD pipelines. And we’re just getting started! Stay tuned as we continue to introduce exciting new capabilities and features to Google Cloud Deploy in the months and quarters to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, to get started with the Preview, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy&#34;&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/quickstart-basic&#34;&gt;quickstart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/tutorials&#34;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.

From cloud-native to more traditional businesses, three themes consistently emerged: cost of ownership, security and audit, and integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a deeper look at these challenges and how we address them with Google Cloud Deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost of ownership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time and again we heard that the operational cost of Kubernetes continuous delivery is high. Identifying best and repeatable practices, scaling delivery tooling and pipelines, and staying current—to say nothing of maintenance—is resource-intensive and takes time away from the core business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We can’t afford to be innovating in continuous delivery,” one customer told us. “We want an opinionated product that supports best practices out of the box.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy addresses cost of ownership head-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a managed service, Google Cloud Deploy eliminates the scaling and maintenance responsibilities that typically come with self-managed continuous delivery solutions. Now you can reclaim the time spent maintaining your continuous delivery tooling and spend it delivering value to your customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy also provides structure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#delivery_pipeline&#34;&gt;Delivery pipelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology&#34;&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; are defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/config-files&#34;&gt;declaratively&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/pipeline-instances&#34;&gt;stored alongside each release&lt;/a&gt;. That means if your delivery pipeline changes, the release’s path to production remains durable. No more time lost troubleshooting issues on in-flight releases caused by changes made to the delivery pipeline.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy GIF&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have found that a variety of GKE roles and personas interact with continuous delivery processes. A DevOps engineer may be focused on release &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploying-application&#34;&gt;promotion and rollback&lt;/a&gt; decisions, while a business decision maker thinks about delivery pipeline health and velocity. Google Cloud Deploy’s user experience keeps these multiple perspectives in mind, making it easier for various personas to perform contextualized reviews and make decisions, improving efficiency and reducing cost of ownership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;Contextualized deployment approvals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security and audit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of different users interact with a continuous delivery system, making a variety of decisions. Not all users and decisions carry the same authority, however. Being able to define a delivery pipeline and make updates doesn’t always mean you can create releases, for example, nor does being able to promote a release to staging mean you can approve it to production. Modern continuous delivery is full of security and audit considerations. Restricting who can access what, where, and how is necessary to maintain release integrity and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Google Cloud Deploy enables fine-grained restriction, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/iam-roles-permissions&#34;&gt;discrete resource access control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/execution-environment&#34;&gt;execution-level security&lt;/a&gt;. For additional safeguards against unwanted approvals, you can also take advantage of flow management features such as release promotion, rollback, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/managing-delivery-pipeline#requiring_approval&#34;&gt;approvals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auditing with Google Cloud Deploy works just like it does for other Google Cloud services. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/audit-logs&#34;&gt;Cloud Audit Logs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/audit-logs&#34;&gt;audits&lt;/a&gt; user-invoked Google Cloud Deploy activities, providing centralized awareness into who promoted a specific release or made an update to a delivery pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you already have continuous delivery capabilities, you likely already have continuous integration (CI), approval and/or operation workflows, and other systems that intersect with your software delivery practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating&#34;&gt;embraces the GKE delivery tooling ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; in three ways: connectivity to CI systems, support for leading configuration (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#render&#34;&gt;rendering&lt;/a&gt;) tooling, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub&#34;&gt;Pub/Sub&lt;/a&gt; notifications to enable third-party integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_your_ci_system&#34;&gt;Connecting Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt; to existing CI tools is straightforward. After you build your containers, Google Cloud Deploy creates a delivery pipeline release that initiates the Kubernetes manifest configuration (render) and deployment process to the first environment in a progression sequence. Whether you are using Jenkins, Cloud Build, or another CI tool, this is usually a simple &lt;i&gt;`&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;gcloud beta deploy releases create`.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deployt_3_efyUGIq.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 3.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deployt_3_efyUGIq.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivering to Kubernetes often changes over time. To help, Google Cloud Deploy  leverages &lt;a href=&#34;https://skaffold.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skaffold&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/skaffold&#34;&gt;standardize your configuration&lt;/a&gt; between development and production environments. Organizations new to Kubernetes typically deploy using raw manifests, but as they become more sophisticated, may want to use more advanced tooling (&lt;a href=&#34;https://helm.sh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kustomize.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kustomize&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kpt.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kpt&lt;/a&gt;). The combination of Google Cloud Deploy and Skaffold lets you transition to these tools without impacting your delivery pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to facilitate other integrations, such as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_automated_testing&#34;&gt;post-deployment test execution&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_third-party_workflow_management&#34;&gt;third party approval workflows&lt;/a&gt;, Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/subscribe-deploy-notifications&#34;&gt;emits Pub/Sub messages&lt;/a&gt; throughout a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/architecture#how_they_fit_together_to_deliver_your_release&#34;&gt;release’s lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive, easy-to-use, and cost-effective DevOps tools are key to building an efficient software development team, and it’s our hope that Google Cloud Deploy will help you complete your CI/CD pipelines. And we’re just getting started! Stay tuned as we continue to introduce exciting new capabilities and features to Google Cloud Deploy in the months and quarters to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meantime, to get started with the Preview, check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy&#34;&gt;product page&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/quickstart-basic&#34;&gt;quickstart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/tutorials&#34;&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>What’s your org’s reliability mindset? Insights from Google SREs</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/the-five-phases-of-organizational-reliability/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Editor’s note: There’s more to ensuring a product’s reliability than following a bunch of prescriptive rules. Today, we hear from some Google SREs—Vartika Agarwal, Senior Technical Program Manager, Development; Tracy Ferrell, Senior SRE Manager; Mahesh Palekar, Director SRE; and Magi Agrama, Senior Technical Program Manager, SRE—about how to evaluate your team’s current reliability mindset, and what you want it to be.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a reliable software product can improve users’ trust in your organization, the effectiveness of your development processes, and the quality of your products overall. More than ever, product reliability is front and center, as outages negatively impact customers and their businesses. But in an effort to develop new features, many organizations limit their reliability efforts to what happens after an outage, and tactically solve for the immediate problems that sparked it. They often fail to realize that they can move quickly while still improving their product’s reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Google, we’ve given a lot of thought to product reliability—and several of its aspects are well understood, for example product or system design. What people think about less is the culture and the mindset of the organization that creates a reliable product in the first place. We believe that the reliability of a product is a property of the architecture of its system, processes, culture, as well as the mindset of the product team or organization that built it. In other words, reliability should be woven into the fabric of an organization, not just the result of a strong design ethos. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we discuss the lessons we’ve learned relevant to organizational or product leads who have the ability to influence the culture of the entire product team, from (but not limited to) engineering, product management, marketing, reliability engineering, and support organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Goals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reliability should be woven into the fabric of how an organization executes. At Google, we’ve developed a terminology to categorize and describe your organization’s reliability mindset, to help you understand how intentional your organization is in this respect. Our ultimate goal is to help you improve and adopt product reliability practices that will permeate the ethos of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By identifying these reliability phases, we do not mean to offer a prescriptive list of things to do that will improve your product’s reliability. Nor should they be read as a set of mandated principles that everyone should apply, or be used to publicly label a team, spurring competition between teams. Rather, leaders should consider these phases as a way to help them develop their team’s culture, on the road to sustainably building reliable products.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The organizational reliability continuum&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on our observations here at Google, there are five basic stages of organizational reliability, and they are based on the classic organizational model of absent, reactive, proactive, strategic and visionary. These phases describe the mindset of an organization at a point in time, and each one of them is characterized by a series of attributes, and is appropriate for different classes of workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Absent: Reliability is a secondary consideration for the organization. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A feature launch is the key organizational metric and is the focus for incentives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of issues are found by users or testers. This organization is not aware of their long-term reliability risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developer velocity is rarely exchanged for reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This reliability phase maybe appropriate for products and projects that are still under development.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reactive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;Responses to reliability issues/risks are tied to recent outages with sporadic follow-through and rarely are there longer-term investments in fixing system issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teams have some reliability metrics defined and react when required.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They write postmortems for outages and create action items for tactical fixes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reasonable availability is maintained through heroic efforts by a few individuals or teams &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Developer productivity is throttled due to a temporary shift in priority on reliability work due to outages. Feature development may be frozen for a short period of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This level is appropriate for products/projects in pre-launch or in a stable long-term maintenance phase.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proactive:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Potential reliability risks are identified and addressed through regular organizational processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Risks are regularly reviewed and prioritized.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teams proactively manage dependencies and review their reliability metrics (SLOs)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New designs are assessed for known risks and failure modes early on. Graceful degradation is a basic requirement.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The business understands the need to continuously invest in reliability and maintain its balance with developer velocity. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Most services/products should be at this level; particularly if they have a large blast radius or are critical to the business.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Strategic:&lt;/b&gt;Organizations at this level manage classes of risk via systemic changes to  architectures, products and processes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reliability is inherent and ingrained in how the organization designs, operates and develops software. Reliability is systemic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Complexity is addressed holistically through product architecture. Dependencies are constantly reduced or improved.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cross-functional organization can sustain reliability and developer velocity simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Organizations widely celebrate quality and stability milestones.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This level is appropriate for services and products that need very high availability to meet business-critical needs.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Visionary:&lt;/b&gt;The organization has reached the highest order of reliability and is able to drive broader reliability efforts within and outside the company (e.g., writing papers, sharing knowledge), based on their best practices and experiences. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reliability knowledge exists broadly across all engineers and teams at a fairly advanced level and is carried forward as they move across organizations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Systems are self-healing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Architectural improvements for reliability positively impact productivity (release velocity) due to reduction of maintenance work/toil.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Very few services or products are at this level, and when they are, are industry leading.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where should you be on the reliability spectrum?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is very important to understand your organization does not necessarily need to be at the strategic or visionary phase. There is a significant cost associated with moving from one phase to another and a cost to remain very high on this curve. In our experience, being proactive is a healthy level to target and is ideal for most products. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;i&gt;To illustrate this point, here is a simple graph of where various Google product teams are on the organizational reliability spectrum; as you can see, it produces a standard bell-curve distribution. While many Google’s product teams have a reactive or proactive reliability culture, most can be described as proactive. You, as an organizational leader, must consciously decide to be at a level based on the product requirements and client expectations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Googles_Reliability_culture.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Google’s Reliability culture.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Googles_Reliability_culture.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, it’s common to have attributes across several phases, for example, an organization may be largely reactive with a few proactive attributes. Team culture will wax and wane between phases, as it takes effort to maintain a strategic reliability culture. However, as more of the organization embraces and celebrates reliability as a key feature, the cost of maintenance decreases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to success is making an honest assessment of what phase you’re in, and then doing concerted work to move to the phase that makes sense for your product. If your organization is in the absent or reactive phase, remember that many products in nascent stages of their life cycle may be comfortable there (in both the startup and long term maintenance of a stable product).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reliability phases in action&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the reliability phases in practice, it is interesting to look at examples of organizations and how they have progressed or regressed through them.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that all companies and teams are different and the progress through these phases can take varying amounts of time. It is not uncommon to take two to three years to move into a truly proactive state. In a proactive state all parts of the organization contribute to reliability without worrying that it will negatively impact feature velocity. Staying in the proactive phase also takes time and effort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nobody can be a hero forever&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One infrastructure services team started small with a few well understood APIs. One key member of the team, a product architect, understood the system well and ensured that things ran smoothly by ensuring design decisions were sound and being at each major incident to rapidly mitigate the issue. This was the one person who understood the entire system and was able to predict what can and cannot impact its stability. But when they left the team, the system complexity grew by leaps and bounds. Suddenly there were many critical user-facing and internal outages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Organizational leaders initiated both short and long-term reliability programs to restore stability. They focused on reducing the blast radius and the impact of global outages. Leadership recognized that to sustain this trajectory, they recognized that they had to go beyond engineering solutions and implement cultural changes such as recognizing reliability as their number-one feature. This led to broad training around reliability best practices, incorporating reliability in architectural/design reviews and recognizing and rewarding reliability beyond hero moments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the organization evolved from a reactive to a strategic reliability mindset, aided by setting reliability as their number-one feature, recognizing and rewarding long-term reliability improvements, and adopting the systemic belief that reliability is everyone’s responsibility—not just that of a few heroes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Googles_Reliability_culture_4.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Google’s Reliability culture 4.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Googles_Reliability_culture_4.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;If you think you are done, think again&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;End users are highly dependent on the reliability of this product and it ties directly to user trust. For this reason, reliability was top of mind for one Google organization for years, and the product was held as the gold standard of reliability by other Google teams. The org was deemed visionary in its reliability processes and work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, over the years, new products were added to the base service. The high level of reliability did not come as freely and easily as it did with the simpler product. Reliability was impacted at the cost of developer velocity and the organization moved to a more reactive reliability mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To turn the ship around, the organization’s leaders had to be intentional about their reliability posture and overall practices, for example, how much they thought about and prioritized reliability. It took several years to move the team back to a strategic mindset. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Googles_Reliability_culture_3.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Google’s Reliability culture 3.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Googles_Reliability_culture_3.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Embrace reliability principles from the start&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another team with a new user-facing product was focused on adding features and growing their user base. Before they knew it, the product took off and saw exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, their laser-focus on managing user requirements and growing user adoption led to high technical debt and reliability issues. Since the service didn’t start off with reliability as a primary focus, it was very hard to incorporate it after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the code had to be re-written and re-architected to reach a sustainable state. The team’s leaders incentivized attention to reliability throughout the organization, from product management through to development and UX domains, constantly reminding the organization about the importance of reliability to the long-term success of the product. This mindshift took years to set in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Google’s Reliability culture 2.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Googles_Reliability_culture_2.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is important that cross-functional organizations be honest about their reliability journeys and determine what is appropriate for their business and product. It is not uncommon for organizations to move from one level to another and then back again as the product matures, stabilizes and then is sunset for the next generation. Getting to a strategic level can be 4+ years in the making and require very high levels of investment from all aspects of the business.  Leaders should ensure their product requires this level of continued investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to study your culture of reliability, assess what phase you are in, determine where you should be on the continuum and carefully and thoughtfully move there. Changing culture is hard and can not be done by edicts or penalties. Most of all, remember that this is a journey and the business is ever-evolving; you cannot set reliability on the shelf and expect it to maintain itself in perpetuity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/devops-sre/evaluating-where-your-team-lies-on-the-sre-spectrum/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/DevOps.max-500x500.jpg&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;Are we there yet?

      <title>Introducing Google Cloud Deploy: Managed continuous delivery to GKE</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/google-cloud-deploy-automates-deploys-to-gke/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is frequently top-of-mind for organizations adopting &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/a&gt; (GKE). However, continuous delivery —deploying container image artifacts into your various environments—remains complex, particularly in Kubernetes environments. With little in the way of accepted best practices, building and scaling continuous delivery tooling, pipelines, and repeatable processes is hard work that requires a lot of on-the-job experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way. &lt;/p&gt;Today, we are pleased to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt;, a managed, opinionated continuous delivery service that makes continuous delivery to GKE easier, faster, and more reliable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 2.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solving for continuous delivery challenges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy is the product of discussions with more than 50 customers to better understand the challenges they face doing continuous delivery to GKE. From cloud-native to more traditional businesses, three themes consistently emerged: cost of ownership, security and audit, and integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a deeper look at these challenges and how we address them with Google Cloud Deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost of ownership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time and again we heard that the operational cost of Kubernetes continuous delivery is high. Identifying best and repeatable practices, scaling delivery tooling and pipelines, and staying current—to say nothing of maintenance—is resource-intensive and takes time away from the core business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We can’t afford to be innovating in continuous delivery,” one customer told us. “We want an opinionated product that supports best practices out of the box.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy addresses cost of ownership head-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a managed service, Google Cloud Deploy eliminates the scaling and maintenance responsibilities that typically come with self-managed continuous delivery solutions. Now you can reclaim the time spent maintaining your continuous delivery tooling and spend it delivering value to your customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy also provides structure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#delivery_pipeline&#34;&gt;Delivery pipelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology&#34;&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; are defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/config-files&#34;&gt;declaratively&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/pipeline-instances&#34;&gt;stored alongside each release&lt;/a&gt;. That means if your delivery pipeline changes, the release’s path to production remains durable. No more time lost troubleshooting issues on in-flight releases caused by changes made to the delivery pipeline.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy GIF&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have found that a variety of GKE roles and personas interact with continuous delivery processes. A DevOps engineer may be focused on release &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploying-application&#34;&gt;promotion and rollback&lt;/a&gt; decisions, while a business decision maker thinks about delivery pipeline health and velocity. Google Cloud Deploy’s user experience keeps these multiple perspectives in mind, making it easier for various personas to perform contextualized reviews and make decisions, improving efficiency and reducing cost of ownership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;Contextualized deployment approvals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security and audit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of different users interact with a continuous delivery system, making a variety of decisions. Not all users and decisions carry the same authority, however. Being able to define a delivery pipeline and make updates doesn’t always mean you can create releases, for example, nor does being able to promote a release to staging mean you can approve it to production. Modern continuous delivery is full of security and audit considerations. Restricting who can access what, where, and how is necessary to maintain release integrity and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Google Cloud Deploy enables fine-grained restriction, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/iam-roles-permissions&#34;&gt;discrete resource access control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/execution-environment&#34;&gt;execution-level security&lt;/a&gt;. For additional safeguards against unwanted approvals, you can also take advantage of flow management features such as release promotion, rollback, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/managing-delivery-pipeline#requiring_approval&#34;&gt;approvals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auditing with Google Cloud Deploy works just like it does for other Google Cloud services. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/audit-logs&#34;&gt;Cloud Audit Logs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/audit-logs&#34;&gt;audits&lt;/a&gt; user-invoked Google Cloud Deploy activities, providing centralized awareness into who promoted a specific release or made an update to a delivery pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you already have continuous delivery capabilities, you likely already have continuous integration (CI), approval and/or operation workflows, and other systems that intersect with your software delivery practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating&#34;&gt;embraces the GKE delivery tooling ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; in three ways: connectivity to CI systems, support for leading configuration (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#render&#34;&gt;rendering&lt;/a&gt;) tooling, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub&#34;&gt;Pub/Sub&lt;/a&gt; notifications to enable third-party integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_your_ci_system&#34;&gt;Connecting Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt; to existing CI tools is straightforward. After you build your containers, Google Cloud Deploy creates a delivery pipeline release that initiates the Kubernetes manifest configuration (render) and deployment process to the first environment in a progression sequence. Whether you are using Jenkins, Cloud Build, or another CI tool, this is usually a simple &lt;i&gt;`&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;gcloud beta deploy releases create`.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deployt_3_efyUGIq.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 3.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deployt_3_efyUGIq.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivering to Kubernetes often changes over time. To help, Google Cloud Deploy  leverages &lt;a href=&#34;https://skaffold.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skaffold&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/skaffold&#34;&gt;standardize your configuration&lt;/a&gt; between development and production environments. Organizations new to Kubernetes typically deploy using raw manifests, but as they become more sophisticated, may want to use more advanced tooling (&lt;a href=&#34;https://helm.sh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kustomize.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kustomize&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kpt.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kpt&lt;/a&gt;). The combination of Google Cloud Deploy and Skaffold lets you transition to these tools without impacting your delivery pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to facilitate other integrations, such as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_automated_testing&#34;&gt;post-deployment test execution&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_third-party_workflow_management&#34;&gt;third party approval workflows&lt;/a&gt;, Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/subscribe-deploy-notifications&#34;&gt;emits Pub/Sub messages&lt;/a&gt; throughout a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/architecture#how_they_fit_together_to_deliver_your_release&#34;&gt;release’s lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive, easy-to-use, and cost-effective DevOps tools are key to building an efficient software development team, and it’s our hope that Google Cloud Deploy will help you complete your CI/CD pipelines. And we’re just getting started!

      <title>Introducing Google Cloud Deploy: Managed continuous delivery to GKE</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/google-cloud-deploy-automates-deploys-to-gke/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is frequently top-of-mind for organizations adopting &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/a&gt; (GKE). However, continuous delivery —deploying container image artifacts into your various environments—remains complex, particularly in Kubernetes environments. With little in the way of accepted best practices, building and scaling continuous delivery tooling, pipelines, and repeatable processes is hard work that requires a lot of on-the-job experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way. &lt;/p&gt;Today, we are pleased to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt;, a managed, opinionated continuous delivery service that makes continuous delivery to GKE easier, faster, and more reliable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 2.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solving for continuous delivery challenges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy is the product of discussions with more than 50 customers to better understand the challenges they face doing continuous delivery to GKE. From cloud-native to more traditional businesses, three themes consistently emerged: cost of ownership, security and audit, and integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a deeper look at these challenges and how we address them with Google Cloud Deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost of ownership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time and again we heard that the operational cost of Kubernetes continuous delivery is high. Identifying best and repeatable practices, scaling delivery tooling and pipelines, and staying current—to say nothing of maintenance—is resource-intensive and takes time away from the core business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We can’t afford to be innovating in continuous delivery,” one customer told us. “We want an opinionated product that supports best practices out of the box.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy addresses cost of ownership head-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a managed service, Google Cloud Deploy eliminates the scaling and maintenance responsibilities that typically come with self-managed continuous delivery solutions. Now you can reclaim the time spent maintaining your continuous delivery tooling and spend it delivering value to your customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy also provides structure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#delivery_pipeline&#34;&gt;Delivery pipelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology&#34;&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; are defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/config-files&#34;&gt;declaratively&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/pipeline-instances&#34;&gt;stored alongside each release&lt;/a&gt;. That means if your delivery pipeline changes, the release’s path to production remains durable. No more time lost troubleshooting issues on in-flight releases caused by changes made to the delivery pipeline.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy GIF&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have found that a variety of GKE roles and personas interact with continuous delivery processes. A DevOps engineer may be focused on release &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploying-application&#34;&gt;promotion and rollback&lt;/a&gt; decisions, while a business decision maker thinks about delivery pipeline health and velocity. Google Cloud Deploy’s user experience keeps these multiple perspectives in mind, making it easier for various personas to perform contextualized reviews and make decisions, improving efficiency and reducing cost of ownership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;Contextualized deployment approvals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security and audit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of different users interact with a continuous delivery system, making a variety of decisions. Not all users and decisions carry the same authority, however. Being able to define a delivery pipeline and make updates doesn’t always mean you can create releases, for example, nor does being able to promote a release to staging mean you can approve it to production. Modern continuous delivery is full of security and audit considerations. Restricting who can access what, where, and how is necessary to maintain release integrity and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Google Cloud Deploy enables fine-grained restriction, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/iam-roles-permissions&#34;&gt;discrete resource access control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/execution-environment&#34;&gt;execution-level security&lt;/a&gt;. For additional safeguards against unwanted approvals, you can also take advantage of flow management features such as release promotion, rollback, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/managing-delivery-pipeline#requiring_approval&#34;&gt;approvals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auditing with Google Cloud Deploy works just like it does for other Google Cloud services. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/audit-logs&#34;&gt;Cloud Audit Logs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/audit-logs&#34;&gt;audits&lt;/a&gt; user-invoked Google Cloud Deploy activities, providing centralized awareness into who promoted a specific release or made an update to a delivery pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you already have continuous delivery capabilities, you likely already have continuous integration (CI), approval and/or operation workflows, and other systems that intersect with your software delivery practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating&#34;&gt;embraces the GKE delivery tooling ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; in three ways: connectivity to CI systems, support for leading configuration (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#render&#34;&gt;rendering&lt;/a&gt;) tooling, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub&#34;&gt;Pub/Sub&lt;/a&gt; notifications to enable third-party integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_your_ci_system&#34;&gt;Connecting Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt; to existing CI tools is straightforward. After you build your containers, Google Cloud Deploy creates a delivery pipeline release that initiates the Kubernetes manifest configuration (render) and deployment process to the first environment in a progression sequence. Whether you are using Jenkins, Cloud Build, or another CI tool, this is usually a simple &lt;i&gt;`&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;gcloud beta deploy releases create`.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deployt_3_efyUGIq.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 3.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deployt_3_efyUGIq.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivering to Kubernetes often changes over time.

Now you can reclaim the time spent maintaining your continuous delivery tooling and spend it delivering value to your customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy also provides structure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#delivery_pipeline&#34;&gt;Delivery pipelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology&#34;&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; are defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/config-files&#34;&gt;declaratively&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/pipeline-instances&#34;&gt;stored alongside each release&lt;/a&gt;. That means if your delivery pipeline changes, the release’s path to production remains durable. No more time lost troubleshooting issues on in-flight releases caused by changes made to the delivery pipeline.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy GIF&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have found that a variety of GKE roles and personas interact with continuous delivery processes. A DevOps engineer may be focused on release &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploying-application&#34;&gt;promotion and rollback&lt;/a&gt; decisions, while a business decision maker thinks about delivery pipeline health and velocity. Google Cloud Deploy’s user experience keeps these multiple perspectives in mind, making it easier for various personas to perform contextualized reviews and make decisions, improving efficiency and reducing cost of ownership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;Contextualized deployment approvals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security and audit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of different users interact with a continuous delivery system, making a variety of decisions. Not all users and decisions carry the same authority, however. Being able to define a delivery pipeline and make updates doesn’t always mean you can create releases, for example, nor does being able to promote a release to staging mean you can approve it to production. Modern continuous delivery is full of security and audit considerations. Restricting who can access what, where, and how is necessary to maintain release integrity and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Google Cloud Deploy enables fine-grained restriction, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/iam-roles-permissions&#34;&gt;discrete resource access control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/execution-environment&#34;&gt;execution-level security&lt;/a&gt;. For additional safeguards against unwanted approvals, you can also take advantage of flow management features such as release promotion, rollback, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/managing-delivery-pipeline#requiring_approval&#34;&gt;approvals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auditing with Google Cloud Deploy works just like it does for other Google Cloud services. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/audit-logs&#34;&gt;Cloud Audit Logs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/audit-logs&#34;&gt;audits&lt;/a&gt; user-invoked Google Cloud Deploy activities, providing centralized awareness into who promoted a specific release or made an update to a delivery pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you already have continuous delivery capabilities, you likely already have continuous integration (CI), approval and/or operation workflows, and other systems that intersect with your software delivery practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating&#34;&gt;embraces the GKE delivery tooling ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; in three ways: connectivity to CI systems, support for leading configuration (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#render&#34;&gt;rendering&lt;/a&gt;) tooling, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub&#34;&gt;Pub/Sub&lt;/a&gt; notifications to enable third-party integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_your_ci_system&#34;&gt;Connecting Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt; to existing CI tools is straightforward. After you build your containers, Google Cloud Deploy creates a delivery pipeline release that initiates the Kubernetes manifest configuration (render) and deployment process to the first environment in a progression sequence. Whether you are using Jenkins, Cloud Build, or another CI tool, this is usually a simple &lt;i&gt;`&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;gcloud beta deploy releases create`.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deployt_3_efyUGIq.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 3.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deployt_3_efyUGIq.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivering to Kubernetes often changes over time. To help, Google Cloud Deploy  leverages &lt;a href=&#34;https://skaffold.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Skaffold&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/skaffold&#34;&gt;standardize your configuration&lt;/a&gt; between development and production environments. Organizations new to Kubernetes typically deploy using raw manifests, but as they become more sophisticated, may want to use more advanced tooling (&lt;a href=&#34;https://helm.sh/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kustomize.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kustomize&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://kpt.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;kpt&lt;/a&gt;). The combination of Google Cloud Deploy and Skaffold lets you transition to these tools without impacting your delivery pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, to facilitate other integrations, such as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_automated_testing&#34;&gt;post-deployment test execution&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_third-party_workflow_management&#34;&gt;third party approval workflows&lt;/a&gt;, Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/subscribe-deploy-notifications&#34;&gt;emits Pub/Sub messages&lt;/a&gt; throughout a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/architecture#how_they_fit_together_to_deliver_your_release&#34;&gt;release’s lifecycle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The future&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive, easy-to-use, and cost-effective DevOps tools are key to building an efficient software development team, and it’s our hope that Google Cloud Deploy will help you complete your CI/CD pipelines. And we’re just getting started!

      <title>Introducing Google Cloud Deploy: Managed continuous delivery to GKE</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/google-cloud-deploy-automates-deploys-to-gke/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery is frequently top-of-mind for organizations adopting &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/a&gt; (GKE). However, continuous delivery —deploying container image artifacts into your various environments—remains complex, particularly in Kubernetes environments. With little in the way of accepted best practices, building and scaling continuous delivery tooling, pipelines, and repeatable processes is hard work that requires a lot of on-the-job experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t have to be this way. &lt;/p&gt;Today, we are pleased to announce &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt;, a managed, opinionated continuous delivery service that makes continuous delivery to GKE easier, faster, and more reliable.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 2.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_2.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Solving for continuous delivery challenges&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy is the product of discussions with more than 50 customers to better understand the challenges they face doing continuous delivery to GKE. From cloud-native to more traditional businesses, three themes consistently emerged: cost of ownership, security and audit, and integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a deeper look at these challenges and how we address them with Google Cloud Deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cost of ownership&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time and again we heard that the operational cost of Kubernetes continuous delivery is high. Identifying best and repeatable practices, scaling delivery tooling and pipelines, and staying current—to say nothing of maintenance—is resource-intensive and takes time away from the core business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“We can’t afford to be innovating in continuous delivery,” one customer told us. “We want an opinionated product that supports best practices out of the box.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy addresses cost of ownership head-on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a managed service, Google Cloud Deploy eliminates the scaling and maintenance responsibilities that typically come with self-managed continuous delivery solutions. Now you can reclaim the time spent maintaining your continuous delivery tooling and spend it delivering value to your customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy also provides structure. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#delivery_pipeline&#34;&gt;Delivery pipelines&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology&#34;&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; are defined &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/config-files&#34;&gt;declaratively&lt;/a&gt; and are &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/pipeline-instances&#34;&gt;stored alongside each release&lt;/a&gt;. That means if your delivery pipeline changes, the release’s path to production remains durable. No more time lost troubleshooting issues on in-flight releases caused by changes made to the delivery pipeline.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy GIF&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/cloud-deploy-pp-blog-post-3.gif&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have found that a variety of GKE roles and personas interact with continuous delivery processes. A DevOps engineer may be focused on release &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/deploying-application&#34;&gt;promotion and rollback&lt;/a&gt; decisions, while a business decision maker thinks about delivery pipeline health and velocity. Google Cloud Deploy’s user experience keeps these multiple perspectives in mind, making it easier for various personas to perform contextualized reviews and make decisions, improving efficiency and reducing cost of ownership.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Deploy 1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Deploy_1.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;Contextualized deployment approvals&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security and audit&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of different users interact with a continuous delivery system, making a variety of decisions. Not all users and decisions carry the same authority, however. Being able to define a delivery pipeline and make updates doesn’t always mean you can create releases, for example, nor does being able to promote a release to staging mean you can approve it to production. Modern continuous delivery is full of security and audit considerations. Restricting who can access what, where, and how is necessary to maintain release integrity and safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout, Google Cloud Deploy enables fine-grained restriction, with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/iam-roles-permissions&#34;&gt;discrete resource access control&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/execution-environment&#34;&gt;execution-level security&lt;/a&gt;. For additional safeguards against unwanted approvals, you can also take advantage of flow management features such as release promotion, rollback, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/managing-delivery-pipeline#requiring_approval&#34;&gt;approvals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Auditing with Google Cloud Deploy works just like it does for other Google Cloud services. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/audit-logs&#34;&gt;Cloud Audit Logs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/audit-logs&#34;&gt;audits&lt;/a&gt; user-invoked Google Cloud Deploy activities, providing centralized awareness into who promoted a specific release or made an update to a delivery pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Integration&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you already have continuous delivery capabilities, you likely already have continuous integration (CI), approval and/or operation workflows, and other systems that intersect with your software delivery practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud Deploy &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating&#34;&gt;embraces the GKE delivery tooling ecosystems&lt;/a&gt; in three ways: connectivity to CI systems, support for leading configuration (&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/terminology#render&#34;&gt;rendering&lt;/a&gt;) tooling, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/pubsub&#34;&gt;Pub/Sub&lt;/a&gt; notifications to enable third-party integrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/integrating#integrating_with_your_ci_system&#34;&gt;Connecting Google Cloud Deploy&lt;/a&gt; to existing CI tools is straightforward.

      <title>2021 Accelerate State of DevOps report addresses burnout, team performance</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/announcing-dora-2021-accelerate-state-of-devops-report/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past seven years, more than 32,000 professionals worldwide have taken part in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops&#34;&gt;Accelerate State of DevOps reports&lt;/a&gt;, making it the largest and longest-running research of its kind. Year over year, the Accelerate State of DevOps reports provide data-driven industry insights that examine the capabilities and practices that drive software delivery as well as operational and organizational performance. That is why Google Cloud’s DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) team is very excited to announce our &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/&#34;&gt;2021 Accelerate State of DevOps Report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our research continues to illustrate that excellence in software delivery and operational performance drives organizational performance in technology transformations. This year we also investigated the effects of SRE best practices, a secure software supply chain, quality documentation, and multicloud—all while gaining a deeper understanding of how this past year affected team’s culture and burnout.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read below to find some of the new findings from this year’s report:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Software delivery performance metrics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on key findings from previous Accelerate State of DevOps reports, we again used &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance&#34;&gt;four metrics&lt;/a&gt; to classify teams as elite, high, medium or low performers based on their software delivery: deployment frequency, lead time for changes, mean-time-to-restore, and change fail rate. This year we saw that elite performers continue to accelerate their pace of software delivery, increasing their lead time for changes from less than one day to less than one hour. Not only that, but elite performers deploy 973x more frequently than low performers, have a 6570x faster lead time to deploy, a 3x lower change failure rate, and an impressive 6570x faster time-to-recover from incidents when failure does happen. You read that right: compared to low performers, elite performers are continually able to empirically demonstrate organizational success with DevOps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/SODR_2021_1.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;SODR_2021_1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/SODR_2021_1.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The fifth metric: from availability to reliability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Historically we have measured availability rather than reliability, but because availability is a specific focus of reliability engineering, we’ve expanded our measure to reliability so that availability, latency, performance, and scalability are more broadly represented. Specifically, we asked respondents to rate their ability to meet or exceed their reliability targets. We found that teams with varying degrees of delivery performance see better outcomes when they also prioritize operational performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2021 insights: the impact of reliability, COVID and secure software supply chains&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to measuring the impact of DevOps adoption on software delivery performance, this year’s DORA report also revealed many other new trends. Here’s a sampling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) A healthy team culture mitigates burnout during challenging times&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Respondents who worked from home because of the pandemic experienced more burnout than those who stayed in the office (a small portion of our sample). Inclusive teams with a generative culture were half as likely to experience burnout during the COVID-19 pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) The highest performers continue to raise the bar&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, high and elite performers make up two-thirds of respondents—compared to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops&#34;&gt;2019 report&lt;/a&gt; where low and medium performers made up 56% of respondents. We can confidently say that as the industry continues to accelerate its adoption of DevOps principles teams see meaningful benefits as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/SODR_2021_2.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;SODR_2021_2.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/SODR_2021_2.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3) SRE and DevOps are complementary philosophies &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extending from its core principles, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)&lt;/a&gt; provides practical techniques, including the service level indicator/service level objective (SLI/SLO) metrics framework. The SRE framework offers definitions on practices and tooling that can enhance a team’s ability to consistently keep promises to their users. Teams that prioritize both delivery and operational excellence report the highest organizational performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate this, we included &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/products/operations&#34;&gt;operations&lt;/a&gt; questions in the survey for the first time this year. The evidence from the survey indicated teams who excel at modern operational practices are 1.4 times more likely to report greater software delivery and operational (SDO) performance  performance, and 1.8 times more likely to report better business outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;4) Cloud adoption continues to drive performance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams continue to move workloads to the cloud and those that leverage &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/architecture/devops/devops-tech-cloud-infrastructure&#34;&gt;all five capabilities&lt;/a&gt; of cloud see increases in SDO performance, as well as in organizational performance. Multicloud adoption is also on the rise so that teams can leverage the unique capabilities of each provider. In fact, respondents who use hybrid or multicloud were 1.6 times more likely to exceed their organizational performance targets. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/SODR_2021_3.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;SODR_2021_3.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/SODR_2021_3.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5) A secure software supply chain is both essential and drives performance &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security can no longer be an afterthought—it must be integrated throughout every stage of the software development lifecycle to build a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/best-practices-and-tools-for-software-supply-chain-security&#34;&gt;secure software supply chain&lt;/a&gt;. Elite performers who met or exceeded their reliability targets were twice as likely to have shifted their security practices left, i.e., implemented security practices earlier on in the software development lifecycle, and deliver reliable software quickly, and safely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;6) Good documentation is foundational for successfully implementing DevOps capabilities&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the first time, we measured the quality of internal documentation and its effect on other capabilities and practices. We found documentation is foundational for successfully implementing DevOps capabilities. Teams with high-quality documentation are 3.8x more likely to implement security best practices and 2.5x more likely to fully leverage the cloud to its fullest potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Introducing the DevOps Awards&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have shared some of our DevOps best practices with you, we would love to hear about how you are transforming your organization with DevOps. In our first annual DevOps Awards, we’ll recognize Google Cloud customers that have improved their deployment frequency, successfully shifted left on security, or improved their change fail rate percentage, etc. Tell us about the positive impact that DevOps has had on your teams, customers, and organization. Enter your submission &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/awards/devops&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks to everyone who took our 2021 survey.

      <title>How Lowe’s SRE reduced its mean time to recovery (MTTR) by over 80 percent</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/how-lowes-improved-incident-response-processes-with-sre/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor’s Note:&lt;/b&gt;In a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/how-lowes-leverages-google-sre-practices&#34;&gt;previous blog&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed how home improvement retailer Lowe’s was able to increase the number of releases it supports by &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/sre&#34;&gt;adopting Google’s Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) framework on Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;. Lowe’s went from one release every two weeks to 20+ releases daily, helping meet its customer needs faster and more effectively. Today, the Lowe’s SRE team shares how they used SRE principles to decrease their mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) by over 80 percent.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes of managing Lowes.com have never been higher, and that means spotting, troubleshooting and recovering from incidents as quickly as possible, so that customers can continue to do business on our site. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do that, it’s crucial to have solid incident engineering practices in place. Resolving an incident means mitigating the impact and/or restoring the service to its previous condition. The average time it takes to do this is called mean time to recovery (MTTR). Tracking this metric helps us stay on top of the overall reliability of our systems at Lowe’s, while simultaneously improving the speed with which we recover. Our goal is to keep the MTTR metric as low as possible, so that failures don’t negatively impact our business. Here are the four areas we addressed to drive holistic improvement in our MTTR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lowe’s incident reporting process&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reduce MTTR, we created a seamless incident reporting process following SRE principles. Our incident reporting process is a workflow that starts at the time an incident occurs, and ends with an SRE captain who closes the action items after a postmortem report. With this approach, we are able to limit the number of critical incidents. The reporting process involves three core components: monitoring, alerting, and blameless postmortems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Monitoring and alerting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having proper monitoring and alerting in place is crucial when it comes to incident management. Monitoring and alerting tools let you detect issues as soon as they occur, and notify the right person in the shortest possible time to take action. From a measurement standpoint, we track this as our mean time to acknowledge (MTTA). This is the average time it takes from when an alert is triggered, to when work on the issue begins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of an incident, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/monitoring&#34;&gt;monitoring and alerting tools&lt;/a&gt; notify the on-call SRE first responder via &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/support/notification-options&#34;&gt;PagerDuty&lt;/a&gt; in the form of a phone call, text message and email. Our SRE software engineering team has done a lot of automation to enable various &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-fundamentals-sli-vs-slo-vs-sla&#34;&gt;Service Level Indicator (SLI) alerts and Service Level Agreement (SLA)&lt;/a&gt; notifications. The on-call SRE then initiates a triage call with our service/domain stakeholders to resolve the incident. As a result, we reduced our MTTA from 30 minutes in 2019, to one minute – a 97 percent decrease. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blameless postmortems: learning from incidents&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A postmortem is a written record of an incident, its impact, the actions taken to resolve it, the root cause and the follow-up actions to prevent the incident from recurring (&lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/example-postmortem/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;see example here&lt;/a&gt;). A blameless postmortem builds on that and is a core part of an SRE culture, and our culture at Lowe’s. We ensure that individuals are not singled out, and the outcome for all postmortems are directed toward learnings and process improvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us, the postmortem process is the biggest part of our incident workflow. When an SRE creates a new postmortem report, the first step is to conduct a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/getting-the-most-out-of-shared-postmortems-cre-life-lessons&#34;&gt;postmortem session&lt;/a&gt; with domain stakeholders to review the report. The postmortem then goes into the review stage and gets reviewed by more stakeholders in our weekly postmortem meeting. In the final stage of this process, the SRE captain will close the report once everyone in the weekly meeting agrees that the report is complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To conduct a successful postmortem, it is critical to keep the focus on identifying gaps and issues with the system and operations processes, rather than an individual, and generate concrete actions to address the problems we’ve identified. To ensure this, we follow a couple of best practices:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We start by gathering the facts from the person who identified the problem, and each SLI owner has to identify a gap or the next SLI upstream owner who created the impact for them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Every SLI owner is provided full opportunity to present their case, and identifying the issue is done as a community exercise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once action items and process changes are identified, an owner is nominated to complete the actions, or they will volunteer. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For easy reference, we publish and store postmortems in our incident knowledge base. This process helps SREs continuously improve as future incidents arise. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continuous Improvement &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Encouraging a culture of honest, transparent and direct feedback that you need for blameless postmortems is often an iterative process that needs sponsorship from executives, empowering incident captains to lead the entirety of the discussion and outcomes. Running successful postmortems, and completing action items from them, needs to be recognized and accounted for in SRE performance objective assessment. As shared in &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google’s SRE book&lt;/a&gt;, the best practice is to ensure that writing effective postmortems is a rewarded and celebrated practice, with leadership’s acknowledgement and participation. This is possibly the hardest part to accomplish in an effective postmortem during a cultural transformation unless you have full buy-in from leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it’s all well worth it. This process is a key part of how we were able to improve our MTTR over time—from two hours in 2019 to just 17 minutes! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our SRE incident reporting process has also transformed how our company solves issues. By streamlining this workflow from alerting, to solving an issue, to blameless postmortems, we have reduced our MTTR by 82 percent and our MTTA by 97 percent. Most importantly, our team is learning from every incident and becoming better engineers as a result.

      <title>Artifact Registry: the next generation of Container Registry</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/understanding-artifact-registry-vs-container-registry/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprise application teams need to manage more than just containers in their software supply chain. That’s why we created &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry&#34;&gt;Artifact Registry&lt;/a&gt;, a fully-managed service with support for both container images and non-container artifacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artifact Registry improves and extends upon the existing capabilities of &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/container-registry&#34;&gt;Container Registry&lt;/a&gt;, such as customer-managed encryption keys, VPC-SC support, Pub/Sub notifications, and more, providing a foundation for major upgrades in security, scalability and control. While Container Registry is still available and will continue to be supported as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/new-api-stability-tenets-govern-google-enterprise-apis&#34;&gt;Google Enterprise API&lt;/a&gt;, going forward new features will only be available in Artifact Registry, and Container Registry will only receive critical security fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we’ll highlight the key improvements Artifact Registry provides over Container Registry, as well as the steps to start using it today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A unified control plane for container, OS and language repositories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artifact Registry includes more than just container images: as a developer, you can store multiple artifact formats, including OS packages for Debian and RPM, as well as language packages for popular languages like Python, Java, and Node. In addition, you can manage them all from a single, unified interface. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A more granular permission model with Cloud IAM&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artifact Registry comes with fine-grained access control via &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/iam&#34;&gt;Cloud IAM&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike Container Registry, this allows you to control access on a per-repository basis, rather than all images stored in a project. This enables you to scope permissions as granularly as possible, for example to specific regions or environments as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Repositories in the region of your choice&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artifact Registry supports the creation of regional repositories, which allows you to put your artifacts and data directly in the location that they&#39;ll be used, allowing for higher availability and speed. In Container Registry, you’re limited to “multi-regions”: for example, the closest multi-region for Australia is Asia. However, with Artifact Registry’s regional support, you can create a repository directly in the Sydney data center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A pricing model that respects your region&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Artifact Registry’s pricing is still based on a combination of network egress and storage usage, support for regional repositories means that you can choose in what region to host your container repositories. Although per unit storage costs are higher for Artifact Registry, optimizing the locations of your repositories to be hosted in the same region where they are used can result in cost savings, because any network traffic within the same region is not considered egress and is thus free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Part of a secure supply chain&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artifact Registry was designed from the ground up to integrate into our suite of secure supply chain products. This means that it can optionally use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/container-analysis/&#34;&gt;Container Analysis&lt;/a&gt; to scan your container images for vulnerabilities as they’re uploaded to Artifact Registry, and works directly with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization&#34;&gt;Binary Authorization&lt;/a&gt; to secure your deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;We’re here to help you migrate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you already use Container Registry, you can take advantage of all the current and upcoming features of container image storage with Artifact Registry by migrating to it. To help, we’ve prepared the following guides:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/transition-from-gcr&#34;&gt;Transitioning from Container Registry&lt;/a&gt; provides an overview of how to use Artifact Registry instead of Container Registry in a backwards-compatible way&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/copy-from-gcr&#34;&gt;Copying images from Container Registry&lt;/a&gt; guide you to move container images from an existing repository to an Artifact Registry repository&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re currently hosting your container images with a third party, you can begin using Artifact Registry directly, by following the instructions in our guide, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/migrate-external-containers&#34;&gt;Migrating containers from a third-party registry&lt;/a&gt;, which shows you how to avoid rate limits on image pulls or third-party outages which can disrupt your builds and deployments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you&#39;re just getting started storing container images, you can begin using Artifact Registry as your image repository right away. To learn how, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/quickstart&#34;&gt;Artifact Registry quickstart for Docker&lt;/a&gt;, a guide to using Artifact Registry as a single location for managing private packages and Docker container images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Join our community &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Artifact Registry communities are also great resources to help answer your questions and for guidance on best practices: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask questions on Stack Overflow using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/google-artifact-registry&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;google-artifact-registry&lt;/a&gt; tag&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://googlecloud-community.slack.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Google Cloud Slack community&lt;/a&gt; and ask a question in the #artifact-registry channel.

      <title>Deploy Anthos on GKE with Terraform part 1: GitOps with Config Sync</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/anthos/using-terraform-to-enable-config-sync-on-a-gke-cluster/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/config-management&#34;&gt;Anthos Config Management (ACM)&lt;/a&gt;offers cloud platform administrators a variety of techniques to streamline cluster configuration. One ACM feature, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/config-sync-overview&#34;&gt;Config Sync&lt;/a&gt;, allows them to use a Git repository to create common configurations that are automatically applied on Kubernetes clusters in their fleet, bringing a familiar code review collaboration process to config management. Another ACM feature, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/policy-controller&#34;&gt;Policy Controller&lt;/a&gt;, enforces security guardrails in compliance with their organization’s requirements. This blog series explores these offerings and how to get started using them with Terraform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many platform administrators prefer &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/solutions/infrastructure-as-code&#34;&gt;Infrastructure as Code&lt;/a&gt; to achieve repeatable and predictable deployments. This also applies to configuring ACM features on Kubernetes clusters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, platform administrators who used Terraform lacked a smooth transition from HCL to modeling cluster configuration. They had to resort to manual processes that required additional temporary permissions granted to operators to complete provisioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/reference/rest/v1beta/projects.locations.features&#34;&gt;GKEHub API&lt;/a&gt; and new resources enabled in &lt;a href=&#34;https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform&lt;/a&gt; —&lt;a href=&#34;https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/gke_hub_feature&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;google_gke_hub_feature&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/gke_hub_feature_membership&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;google_hub_feature_membership&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/gke_hub_membership&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;google_gke_hub_membership—&lt;/a&gt;make it possible to automate last mile cluster configuration, including pointing it to a Git repository and turning on the Policy Controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For platform administrators, this solves previous challenges of modeling cluster configuration such as namespaces, services accounts, RBAC, in a Kubernetes idiomatic way, i.e. without the awkward Terraform HCL counterparts. Better still this natural, IaC approach improves auditability and transparency and reduces risk of misconfigurations or security gaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this 3 part blog series, we’ll show how you can enable Anthos features on GKE. We’ll start with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/config-sync-overview&#34;&gt;Config Sync&lt;/a&gt; to reconcile the cluster state with the specified Git repository. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on a GKE cluster resource in your Terraform configuration:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can then enable GKE Hub membership, and the &lt;b&gt;configmanagement&lt;/b&gt; feature:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional settings can then be configured for each of the features - &lt;b&gt;sync_repo&lt;/b&gt; to point at the repo storing your cluster configurations, &lt;b&gt;poliy_dir&lt;/b&gt; to point at the root of the repo to reconcile, and the specific &lt;b&gt;sync_branch&lt;/b&gt; in the repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying this configuration with Terraform will enable Config Sync and will automatically synchronize the state of the cluster with the repo, immediately creating the Kubernetes config objects on the cluster. Your pods, deployments, services and other native K8s objects will automatically be created. See this &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/configs&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for more details on how to organize configs in a repo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cluster now is fully provisioned and requires no “last mile” configuration steps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-google-kubernetes-engine/tree/master/examples/acm-terraform-blog-part1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;repo&lt;/a&gt; provides a complete example of provisioning a cluster that is synchronized with a repo that contains a popular WordPress configuration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next part of the series we’ll show you how you can use Terraform to configure another ACM feature - Policy Controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/containers-kubernetes/anthos-config-management-config-controller-available-on-gke/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/GCP_Kubernetes_A.max-500x500.jpg&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;Get in sync: Consistent Kubernetes with new Anthos Config Management features&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;Anthos Config Management and Config Controller bring Kubernetes-style declarative policy and config management to GKE environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From large digital-native powerhouses to midsized manufacturing firms, every company today is creating and deploying &lt;b&gt;more software to more places more often&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/config-management&#34;&gt;Anthos Config Management&lt;/a&gt; lets you set and enforce consistent configurations and policies for your Kubernetes resources—wherever you build and run them—and manage Google Cloud services the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, as a part of Anthos Config Management, we are introducing &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/config-controller-overview&#34;&gt;Config Controller&lt;/a&gt;, a hosted service to provision and orchestrate Google Cloud resources. This service offers an API endpoint that can provision, actuate, and orchestrate Google Cloud resources the same way it manages Kubernetes resources. You don’t have to install or manage the components—or be an expert in Kubernetes resource management or GitOps—because Google Cloud will manage them for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we’re also announcing that, in addition to using it for hybrid and multicloud use cases, Anthos Config Management is now available for Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) as a standalone service. GKE customers can now take advantage of config and policy automation in Google Cloud at a low incremental per-cluster cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These announcements deliver a whole new approach to config and policy management—one that’s descriptive or &lt;i&gt;declarative&lt;/i&gt;, rather than procedural or &lt;i&gt;imperative&lt;/i&gt;. Let’s take a closer look.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Let Kubernetes automate your configs and policies &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Development teams need stable and secure environments to build apps quickly and deploy them easily. Today, platform teams often scramble to provision and configure the necessary infrastructure components, apps, and cloud services the same way—in many different places—and keep them all up-to-date, patched, and secure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The struggle is real, and it’s not new. Platform administrators have been hand-crafting and partially automating configuration with new infrastructure-as-code languages and tools for years. We can spin up new containerized dev environments in minutes in the cloud and on-prem. We can push code to production hundreds of times a day with automated CI/CD processes. So why do configurations drift and fall out of sync with production? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because it takes time and toil to develop a &lt;b&gt;consistent and automated way to &lt;i&gt;describe&lt;/i&gt; what we want, &lt;i&gt;create&lt;/i&gt; what we need, and repair what we break.&lt;/b&gt; The declarative &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/understanding-configuration-as-data-in-kubernetes&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Resource Model (KRM)&lt;/a&gt; reduces this toil with a consistent way to define and update resources: describe what you want and Kubernetes makes it happen. ACM makes it even easier by adding &lt;b&gt;pre-built, opinionated config and policy automations&lt;/b&gt;, such as creating a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/tutorials/landing-zone&#34;&gt;secure landing zone&lt;/a&gt; and provisioning a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/tutorials/gke-cluster-blueprint&#34;&gt;GKE cluster from a blueprint&lt;/a&gt;. Blueprints help platform teams configure both Kubernetes and Google Cloud services the same way every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/GKE_cluster_from_a_blueprint.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;GKE cluster from a blueprint.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/GKE_cluster_from_a_blueprint.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Describe your intent with a single resource model&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kubernetes API server includes controllers that make sure your container infrastructure state always matches the state you declare in YAML. For example, Kubernetes can ensure that a load balancer and service proxy are always created, connected to the right pods, and configured properly. But KRM can manage more than just container infrastructure. You can use KRM to deploy and manage resources such as cloud databases, storage, and networks. It can also manage your custom-developed apps and services using &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;custom resource definitions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Create what you need from a single source of truth&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Anthos Config Management, you declare and set configurations once and forget them. You don’t have to be an expert in KRM or GitOps-style configuration because the hosted Config Controller service takes care of it. Config Controller provisions infrastructure, apps, and cloud services; configures them to meet your desired intent; monitors them for configuration drift; and applies changes every time you push a new resource declaration to your Git repository. Config changes are as easy as a git push—and easily integrate with your development workflows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthos Config Management uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/config-sync-overview&#34;&gt;Config Sync&lt;/a&gt; to continuously reconcile the state of your registered clusters and resources—that means any GKE, Anthos, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/multicluster-management/connect/registering-a-cluster&#34;&gt;other registered&lt;/a&gt; cluster—and makes sure unvetted changes are never pushed to live clusters. Anthos Config Management reduces the risk of dev or ops teams making any changes outside the Git source of truth by requiring code reviews and rolling back any breaking changes to a good working state. In short, using Anthos Config Management both encourages and enforces best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Repair what breaks for automated compliance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthos Config Management’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/policy-controller&#34;&gt;Policy Controller&lt;/a&gt; makes it easier to create and enforce fully programmable policies across all connected clusters. Policies act as guardrails to prevent any changes to configuration from violating your custom security, operational, or compliance controls. For example, you can set policies to actively block any non-compliant API requests, require every namespace to have a label, prevent pods from running privileged containers, restrict the types of storage volumes a container can mount, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy Controller is based on the open source &lt;a href=&#34;https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Open Policy Agent Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; project, augmented by Google Cloud with a ready-to-use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/reference/constraint-template-library&#34;&gt;library of pre-built policies&lt;/a&gt; for the most common security and compliance controls. Customers can establish a secure baseline easily without deep expertise and ACM applies policies to a single cluster (e.g. GKE) or to a distributed set of Anthos clusters on-prem or in other cloud platforms. You can audit and add your own custom policies by allowing your security-savvy experts to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/how-to/write-a-constraint-template&#34;&gt;create constraint templates&lt;/a&gt; which anyone &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/how-to/creating-constraints&#34;&gt;can invoke&lt;/a&gt; in different dev or production environments without learning how to write or manage policy code. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/how-to/auditing-constraints&#34;&gt;audit functionality&lt;/a&gt; included allows platform admins to audit all violations, simplifying compliance reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Configure and control every cluster consistently&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hosted service, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/config-controller-overview&#34;&gt;Config Controller&lt;/a&gt;, which runs Config Connector, Config Sync, and Policy Controller for you, is available in Preview. Config Controller leverages &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Config Connector,&lt;/a&gt; which lets you manage &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/reference/overview&#34;&gt;Google Cloud resources&lt;/a&gt; the same way you manage other Kubernetes resources, with continuous monitoring and self-healing. For example, you can ask Config Connector to create a Cloud SQL instance and a database. Config Connector can manage more than 60 Google Cloud resources, including Bigtable, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Spanner, Cloud Storage, and Cloud Load Balancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/anthos_config_manager.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;anthos config manager.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/anthos_config_manager.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve embraced a consistent resource model, using ACM to enforce configuration and policy automatically for individual resources, take the next step with blueprints. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/concepts/blueprints&#34;&gt;blueprint&lt;/a&gt; is a package of config and policy that documents an opinionated solution to deploy and manage &lt;b&gt;multiple&lt;/b&gt; resources at once. Blueprints capture best practices and policy guardrails, package them together, and let you deploy them as a complete solution to any Kubernetes clusters using Config Controller. Use Blueprints to manage multiple resources at once, or to create customized &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/tutorials/landing-zone&#34;&gt;landing zones&lt;/a&gt;—compliant, properly configured, and easily duplicated environments that meet your own best practice guidelines and that are properly networked and secured. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Vienna Insurance Group uses Anthos Config Management in its Viesure Innovation Center, which it credits with improving its compliance posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&#34;Google&#39;s Landing Zones and Config Controller equipped us with an extensive set of tools to set up our Google Cloud infrastructure quickly and securely. Their policy controllers are a powerful instrument for ensuring compliance for all our Google Cloud resources.&#34;&lt;/i&gt; —Rene Schakmann, Head of Technology at viesure innovation center GmbH&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Get started today&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anthos Config Management on GKE is generally available today. If you’re a GKE customer, you can also now use Anthos Config Management at a low incremental cost. By making it available to GKE customers, and offering it as a hosted, managed service for everyone, we’re making it easier than ever for you to leverage “KRM as a service” to simplify and secure Kubernetes resource management from the data center to the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To learn more about the technical details behind ACM, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetespodcast.com/episode/154-gatekeeper-and-policy-controller/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this recent episode&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetespodcast.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Kubernetes Podcast from Google&lt;/a&gt; with the TL for Policy Controller, Max Smythe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/containers-kubernetes/understanding-configuration-as-data-in-kubernetes/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Google_Cloud-01_xyGPYQS.max-500x500.png&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;I do declare!

      <title>Securing the software development lifecycle with Cloud Build and SLSA</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/google-introduces-slsa-framework/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges for software developers is the need to make informed choices about the external software and products they use in their own software systems. Evaluating whether a given system is appropriately secured can be challenging, especially if it’s external or owned by a third party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This so-called software supply chain has been under increasing scrutiny in recent years, with attacks on software systems being responsible for damages to both public and private interests. In collaboration with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://openssf.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;OpenSSF&lt;/a&gt;, Google has proposed Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA). The new &lt;a href=&#34;https://slsa.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SLSA&lt;/a&gt; framework formalizes criteria around software supply chain integrity, to help the industry and open-source ecosystem secure the software development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Secure your own software development lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLSA is not just for the public software supply chain. You can also apply these same levels, originally inspired by Google’s internal framework for secure software delivery, to your own software development life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;software development lifecycle.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/software_development_life.0480027109600294.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each level of SLSA represents an incremental step towards a more secure software supply chain, adding additional security guidelines to address the most common threats to source and build integrity. Nor are these guidelines Google-specific: they are developed by the security extended community and established by consensus to be adopted amongst the wider industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although SLSA is a new framework, many of the security guidelines it advocates for are already available for and adopted by consumers today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Understanding SLSA&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SLSA framework introduces a number of new tools and concepts for securing the software development lifecycle:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Artifact - any file produced as the result of a build pipeline, such as container images, language packages, compiled binaries, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provenance - metadata about how an artifact was built, including the build process, top-level source, and dependencies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digest - the result of a cryptographic hash function which produces a fixed-size value uniquely identifying an artifact, such as a SHA-256 hash of a container image&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attestation - a cryptographically signed file recording the provenance of the build pipeline at the time a specific artifact or set of artifacts was produced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attestor - any system or process that produces an attestation, often included as part of a build pipeline after artifact creation and prior to deployment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immutable references - an identifier, such as a URL, that is guaranteed to always point to the same, immutable artifact, such as a specific container image or language package&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build integrity - the verification of the output of a build pipeline via attestations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When used in combination, these represent a build pipeline that adheres to the standards set by the SLSA framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cloud Build supports SLSA 1&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/build&#34;&gt;Cloud Build&lt;/a&gt;, Google Cloud’s hosted CI/CD platform, you are likely already operating a software development lifecycle at SLSA 1, the first step in securing your software delivery pipeline. That’s because by default, Cloud Build allows you to create an automated build pipeline, and because any Cloud Build pipeline automatically generates provenance. While provenance for Cloud Build has been available for quite some time, it hasn’t been widely used to verify build pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a software supply chain at SLSA 1 does not entirely protect against tampering, but it does offer a basic level of code source identification and may aid in vulnerability management, protecting against software delivery that is not a product of the CI/CD system. At the same time, Cloud Build represents a foundation for a hosted software build system upon which you can reach higher SLSA levels, using techniques like verifiable source control, automatically verified provenance, and tools like &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/binary-authorization&#34;&gt;Binary Authorization&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You can start now&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;By creating a build process that’s fully automated, mandating the use of a build system for production workflows, and by building your software pipeline with Cloud Build, you can have a SLSA 1 supply chain right from the start. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get started today, you can follow the Cloud Build quickstart for &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/quickstart-build&#34;&gt;building a Docker image and pushing the image to Artifact Registry&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the quickstart for &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/quickstart-deploy&#34;&gt;deploying that containerized application to Cloud Run&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more details on SLSA, you can read more here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://slsa.dev/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SLSA: Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://security.googleblog.com/2021/06/introducing-slsa-end-to-end-framework.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Introducing SLSA, an End-to-End Framework for Supply Chain Integrity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Want to learn more about how you as a developer can help improve the security of your software?

      <title>Introducing Cloud Build private pools: Secure CI/CD for private networks</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/cloud-build-private-pools-offers-cicd-for-private-networks/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://devops.com/survey-shows-mounting-devops-frustration-and-costs/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; found that developers spend 39% of their time managing the DevOps infrastructure that powers their continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) pipelines. Unreliable availability, manual provisioning, limited scaling, breaking upgrades, long queue times, and high fixed costs all slow down development and take valuable time and focus away from DevOps teams. And while cloud-based CI/CD solutions can solve many of these friction points, they largely only work with cloud-hosted resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That’s why we’re excited to announce that starting today, you can take advantage of serverless build environments within your own private network, with new &lt;b&gt;Cloud Build private pools&lt;/b&gt;. Launched in 2018, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/build&#34;&gt;Cloud Build&lt;/a&gt; has helped thousands of customers modernize their CI/CD workloads to run on fully managed, secure, pay-as-you-go ‘workers’ with no infrastructure to manage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Build offers on-demand auto-scaling capabilities, active build minute billing, all with no infrastructure to manage. The new private pools feature augments Cloud Build with secure, fully managed CI/CD and DevOps workflow automation that uses network peering to connect into your private networks. Private pools also unlocks a host of new customization options such as new machine types, higher maximum concurrency, regional builds, and network configuration options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Cloud Build private pools, you get the benefits of a cloud-hosted, fully managed CI/CD product while meeting enterprise security and compliance requirements—even for highly regulated industries like finance, healthcare, retail, and others.

We recently launched the &lt;a href=&#34;https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cIb0SmhJPfm8H7n&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2021 State of DevOps survey&lt;/a&gt;, a 25-min survey for the DevOps community to share how they are using DevOps to improve software delivery performance. So if you haven’t taken the survey yet, this is your chance! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those unfamiliar with the State Of DevOps report, it is the largest and longest running research of its kind. It provides an independent view into how teams and companies can drive powerful business outcomes, no matter what stage of the DevOps journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops&#34;&gt;State of DevOps&lt;/a&gt; reports we aim to capture how teams and companies are driving excellence in technology delivery through the implementation of DevOps practices, no matter what stage of the DevOps journey your team is in. If you’re wondering how your team measures up in your industry take our &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devops-research.com/quickcheck.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DevOps Quick Check&lt;/a&gt; and discover which capabilities you should focus on to improve your performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To capture a diverse array of information on how those in the DevOps community are performing, our eight sponsors of the 2021 State of DevOps survey are focussed on helping organizations of all sizes and industries to develop and deliver software faster across the whole DevOps lifecycle. Captured below, you’ll find more information on our sponsors for this year and why they chose to sponsor the State Of the DevOps 2021 Report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.armory.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Armory&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;armory&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/armory.max-1000x1000.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armory enables enterprise companies to ship better software, faster through trusted, reliable, safe, and secure deployments -- at its core, Armory is powered by Spinnaker OSS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Armory exists to unlock innovation through software. To achieve this, we help enterprises reliably deploy software at scale, naturally aligning with DevOps practices to improve software delivery performance. Given this, we applaud efforts like the State of DevOps Report that provides an independent view into the practices and capabilities that organizations can employ to drive better performance.&#34; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Timm, Senior Director of Product Marketing at Armory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://circleci.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CircleCI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;circleci&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/circelci.max-1000x1000.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world’s best software teams deliver quality code, confidently, with CircleCI. The world’s best software teams use CircleCI to go from next-up to feature shipped, at the speed ambitious businesses require. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Though the DevOps space is only over a decade old, it moves incredibly quickly. Google’s State of DevOps report is both a reflection and projection of the industry, capturing how DevOps culture drives business results and where DevOps practitioners can look to improve. At CircleCI, we rely heavily on this survey data to glean valuable insights into our market and our customers overall. We also build upon these insights to guide our own research into how engineering teams move code through pipelines in our annual &lt;a href=&#34;https://circleci.com/resources/2020-state-of-software-delivery/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;State of Software Delivery report&lt;/a&gt;. Taken together, this research highlights teams’ reported and actual behavior and paints a vibrant picture of how technology-driven organizations drive for success.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emma Webb, VP, Corporate Communications, CircleCI &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cd.foundation/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Continuous Delivery Foundation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--medium h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--4 h-c-grid__col--offset-4 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;cdf&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/cdf.max-1000x1000.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;CD Foundation is an open-source community improving the world&#39;s ability to deliver software with security and speed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Good decision-making is based on good data. Open source is a critical piece of the technology roadmap for DevOps, and the 2021 State of DevOps Report will provide actionable information for high performing teams in organizations of all types and sizes. The report will show where open source and DevOps intersect, and in a space that is changing so quickly, new relevant data is critical,&#34; said Tracy Miranda, Continuous Delivery Foundation Executive Director. &#34;CD Foundation members are deeply involved with producing this annual report, with over 10 years of historic research. Thank you to Google and our other members who have worked so hard on it.

      <title>A blueprint for secure infrastructure on Google Cloud</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/blueprint-secure-infrastructure-google-cloud/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to infrastructure security, every stakeholder has the same goal: maintain the confidentiality and integrity of their company’s data and systems. Period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developing and operating in the Cloud provides the opportunity to achieve these goals by being more secure and having greater visibility and governance over your resources and data. This is due to the relatively uniform environment of cloud infrastructure (as compared with on-prem) and inherent service-centric architecture. In addition, cloud providers take on some of the key responsibilities for security doing their part in a shared responsibility model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, translating this shared goal into reality can be a complex endeavor for a few reasons. Firstly, administering security in public clouds is unlike what you may be used to as the infrastructure primitives (the building blocks available to you) and control abstractions (how you administer security policy) differ from on premise environments. Additionally, ensuring you make the right policy decisions in an area as high-stakes and ever-evolving as security means that you’ll likely spend hours researching and reading through documentation, perhaps even hiring experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/delivering-the-industrys-most-trusted-cloud&#34;&gt;partner with you&lt;/a&gt; and help address these challenges, Google Cloud built the security foundations blueprint to identify core security decisions and guide you with opinionated best practices for deploying a secured GCP environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What is the security foundations blueprint?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The security foundations blueprint is made up of two resources: the &lt;a href=&#34;https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;security foundations guide&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform automation repository&lt;/a&gt;. For each security decision, the security foundations guide provides opinionated best practices in order to help you build a secure starting point for your Google Cloud deployment, and can be read and used as a reference guide. The recommended policies and architecture outlined in the document can then be deployed through automation using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform repository&lt;/a&gt; available on GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Who is it for?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The security foundations blueprint was designed with the enterprise in mind, including those with the strongest security requirements. However, the best practices are applicable to any size cloud customer, and can be adapted or adopted in pieces as needed for your organization. As far as who in an organization is going to find it most useful, it is beneficial for many roles:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;CISOs and compliance officers&lt;/b&gt; will use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;security foundations guide&lt;/a&gt; as a reference to understand Google’s key principles for Cloud Security and how they can be applied and implemented to their deployments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security practitioners&lt;/b&gt; and&lt;b&gt;platform teams&lt;/b&gt; will follow the guide’s detailed instructions and accompanying Terraform templates for applying best practices so that they can actively set-up, configure, deploy, and operate their own security-centric infrastructure. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Application developers&lt;/b&gt; will deploy their workloads and applications on this foundational infrastructure through an automated application deployment pipeline provided in the blueprint. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What topics does it cover?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This security foundations blueprint continues to expand the topics it covers, with its most recent release in April 2021 including the following areas:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Google Cloud organization structure and policy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Authentication and authorization&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resource hierarchy and deployment&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Networking (segmentation and security)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key and secret management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logging&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Detective controls&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Billing setup&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Application security&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the security decisions addressed in these topics come with background and discussion to support your own understanding of the concepts, which in turn enables you to customize the deployment to your own specific use case (if needed).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The topics are useful separately, which makes it possible to pick-and-choose areas where you need recommendations, but they also work together. For example, by following the best practices for project and resource naming conventions, you will be set up for advanced monitoring capabilities, such as real-time notifications for compliance to custom policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How can I use it?&lt;/h3&gt;While the &lt;a href=&#34;https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;security foundations guide&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly valuable on its own, the real magic for a security practitioner or application developer comes from the ability to adopt, adapt, and deploy the best practices using templates in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for managing Infrastructure as Code (IaC). For anyone new to IaC, simply put, it allows you to automate your infrastructure through writing code that configures and provisions your infrastructure. By using IaC to minimize the amount of manual configuration, you also benefit through limiting the possibility of human error in enforcing these components of your security policy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Untitled_2.max-1000x1000.png&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;The Security Foundations Blueprint&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Untitled_2.max-1000x1000.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Security Foundations Blueprint as an automated deployment pipeline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform automation repo&lt;/a&gt; includes configuration that defines the environment outlined in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;. You can apply the repo end-to-end to deploy the full security foundations blueprint, or use the included modules individually and modify them so that you can adopt just portions of the blueprint. It’s important to note that there are a few differences between the policies for the sample organization outlined in the guide and what is deployed using the Terraform templates. Luckily, those few differences are outlined in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation/blob/master/ERRATA.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;errata pages&lt;/a&gt; that are part of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform automation repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;So what should I do next? &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope you’ll continue following the journey of this blog series where we’ll dive deeper into the best practices provided throughout the topical sections of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt;, discuss the different ways in which the blueprints have helped enterprises secure their own Cloud deployment, and take a look inside the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform templates&lt;/a&gt; to see how they can be adopted, adapted, and deployed. In the meantime, take a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide&#34;&gt;this recent Cloud blog post&lt;/a&gt; which announces the launch of the blueprint’s latest version and discusses the key security principles that steer the best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If you’re ready to dive straight into the &lt;a href=&#34;https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;security foundations guide&lt;/a&gt;, you can start at the beginning, or head to a topic in which you’re particularly interested. Reviewing the guide in this way, you will be able to see for yourself the level of detail and discussion, and most importantly, the direct path it provides to move beyond recommendations and into implementation. We don’t expect you to try and apply the blueprint to your security posture right away, but a great first step would be to fork the repo and deploy it in a new folder or organization. Go forth, deploy and stay safe out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/identity-security/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Google_Cloud_security.max-500x500.jpg&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;Build security into Google Cloud deployments with our updated security foundations blueprint&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;Get step by step guidance for creating a secured environment with Google Cloud with the security foundations guide and Terraform blueprin...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

Additionally, ensuring you make the right policy decisions in an area as high-stakes and ever-evolving as security means that you’ll likely spend hours researching and reading through documentation, perhaps even hiring experts. </p><p>To <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/delivering-the-industrys-most-trusted-cloud" track-type="inline link" track-name="1" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/delivering-the-industrys-most-trusted-cloud" track-metadata-module="post">partner with you</a> and help address these challenges, Google Cloud built the security foundations blueprint to identify core security decisions and guide you with opinionated best practices for deploying a secured GCP environment. </p><h3>What is the security foundations blueprint?</h3><p>The security foundations blueprint is made up of two resources: the <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="2" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://services.google.com" track-metadata-module="post">security foundations guide</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="3" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://github.com" track-metadata-module="post">Terraform automation repository</a>. For each security decision, the security foundations guide provides opinionated best practices in order to help you build a secure starting point for your Google Cloud deployment, and can be read and used as a reference guide. The recommended policies and architecture outlined in the document can then be deployed through automation using the <a href="https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="4" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://github.com" track-metadata-module="post">Terraform repository</a> available on GitHub. </p><h3>Who is it for?</h3><p>The security foundations blueprint was designed with the enterprise in mind, including those with the strongest security requirements. However, the best practices are applicable to any size cloud customer, and can be adapted or adopted in pieces as needed for your organization. As far as who in an organization is going to find it most useful, it is beneficial for many roles:</p><ul><li><b>CISOs and compliance officers</b> will use the <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="5" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://services.google.com" track-metadata-module="post">security foundations guide</a> as a reference to understand Google’s key principles for Cloud Security and how they can be applied and implemented to their deployments.</li><li><b>Security practitioners</b> and<b> platform teams</b> will follow the guide’s detailed instructions and accompanying Terraform templates for applying best practices so that they can actively set-up, configure, deploy, and operate their own security-centric infrastructure. </li><li><b>Application developers</b> will deploy their workloads and applications on this foundational infrastructure through an automated application deployment pipeline provided in the blueprint. </li></ul><h3>What topics does it cover?</h3><p>This security foundations blueprint continues to expand the topics it covers, with its most recent release in April 2021 including the following areas:</p><ul><li>Google Cloud organization structure and policy</li><li>Authentication and authorization</li><li>Resource hierarchy and deployment</li><li>Networking (segmentation and security)</li><li>Key and secret management</li><li>Logging</li><li>Detective controls</li><li>Billing setup</li><li>Application security</li></ul><p>Each of the security decisions addressed in these topics come with background and discussion to support your own understanding of the concepts, which in turn enables you to customize the deployment to your own specific use case (if needed).</p><p>The topics are useful separately, which makes it possible to pick-and-choose areas where you need recommendations, but they also work together. For example, by following the best practices for project and resource naming conventions, you will be set up for advanced monitoring capabilities, such as real-time notifications for compliance to custom policies.</p><h3>How can I use it?</h3><p>While the <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="6" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://services.google.com" track-metadata-module="post">security foundations guide</a> is incredibly valuable on its own, the real magic for a security practitioner or application developer comes from the ability to adopt, adapt, and deploy the best practices using templates in <a href="https://www.terraform.io/" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="7" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://www.terraform.io" track-metadata-module="post">Terraform</a>, a tool for managing Infrastructure as Code (IaC). For anyone new to IaC, simply put, it allows you to automate your infrastructure through writing code that configures and provisions your infrastructure. By using IaC to minimize the amount of manual configuration, you also benefit through limiting the possibility of human error in enforcing these components of your security policy.</p></div></paragraph-block></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Are we there yet? Thoughts on assessing an SRE team’s maturity</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/evaluating-where-your-team-lies-on-the-sre-spectrum/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One facet of our work as &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/introducing-a-new-era-of-customer-support-google-customer-reliability-engineering&#34;&gt;Customer Reliability Engineers&lt;/a&gt;—Google Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) tapped to help Google Cloud customers develop that practice in their own organizations—is advising operations or SRE teams to improve their operational maturity. We&#39;ve noticed a recurring question cropping up across many of these discussions, usually phrased along the lines of &#34;is what we&#39;re currently doing &lt;i&gt;&#39;SRE work&#39;?&#34;&lt;/i&gt; or, with a little more existential dread, &#34;can we call ourselves SREs yet?&#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve answered this question before with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/how-to-start-and-assess-your-sre-journey&#34;&gt;list of practices&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SRE workbook&lt;/a&gt;. But the list is long on the &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; and short on the &lt;i&gt;why&lt;/i&gt;, which can make it hard to digest for folks already suffering an identity crisis. Instead, we hope to help answer this question by discussing some principles we consider fundamental to how an SRE team operates. We&#39;ll examine why they&#39;re important and suggest questions that characterize a team&#39;s progress towards embodying them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are we there yet?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question is asked in different ways, for a myriad of different reasons, and it can be quite hard to answer due to the wide range of &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.devopstopologies.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;different circumstances&lt;/a&gt; that our customers operate in. Moreover, CRE, and Google in general, is not the final arbiter of what is and isn&#39;t &#34;SRE&#34; for your organization, so we can&#39;t provide an authoritative answer, if one even exists. We can only influence you and the community at large by expressing our opinions and experiences, in person or via our &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/books/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;books&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/cre-life-lessons&#34;&gt;blog posts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, discussions of this topic tend to be complicated by the fact that the term &#34;SRE&#34; is used interchangeably to mean three things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;job role&lt;/b&gt; primarily focused on maintaining the reliability of a service or product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;group of people&lt;/b&gt;working within an organization, usually in the above job role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;b&gt;set of principles and practices&lt;/b&gt; that the above people can utilize to improve service reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people ask &#34;can we call ourselves SREs yet?&#34; we could interpret it as a desire to link these three definitions together. A clearer restatement of this interpretation might be: &#34;Is our &lt;b&gt;group&lt;/b&gt; sufficiently advanced in our application of the &lt;b&gt;principles and practices&lt;/b&gt; that we can justifiably term our &lt;b&gt;job role&lt;/b&gt; SRE?&#34; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We should stress that we&#39;re not saying that you need a clearly defined &lt;b&gt;job role&lt;/b&gt;—or even a &lt;b&gt;team&lt;/b&gt;—before you can start utilizing the &lt;b&gt;principles and practices&lt;/b&gt; to do things that are recognizably SRE-like. Job roles and teams crystallize from a more fluid set of responsibilities as organizations grow larger. But as this process plays out, the people involved may feel less certain of the scope of their responsibilities, precipitating the ‘are we there yet?’ question. We suspect that&#39;s where the tone of existential dread comes from...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key SRE indicators&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the CRE team here at Google Cloud, the ‘are we there yet?’ question surfaced a wide variety of opinions about the core principles that should guide an SRE team. We did manage to reach a rough consensus, with one proviso—the answer is partially dependent on how a team engages with the services it supports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ve chosen to structure this post around a set of principles that we would broadly expect groups of people working as SREs that &lt;i&gt;directly support services in production&lt;/i&gt; to adhere to. As in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litmus#Uses&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;litmus test&lt;/a&gt;, this won&#39;t provide pin-point accuracy; but in our collective opinion at least, alignment with most of the principles laid out below is a good signal that a team is practicing something that can recognizably be termed &lt;i&gt;Site Reliability Engineering.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Directly engaged SRE teams are usually considered &lt;i&gt;Accountable&lt;/i&gt; (in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RACI terms&lt;/a&gt;) for the service’s reliability, with &lt;i&gt;Responsibility&lt;/i&gt; shared between the SRE and development teams. As a team provides less direct support these indicators may be less applicable. We hope those teams can still adapt the principles to their own circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate how you might do this, for each principle we&#39;ve given a counter-example of a team of SREs operating in an advisory capacity. They&#39;re subject-matter experts who are &lt;i&gt;Consulted&lt;/i&gt; by development teams who are themselves &lt;i&gt;Responsible&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Accountable&lt;/i&gt; for service reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever your engagement model lies on the spectrum, being perceived by the rest of the organization as jointly responsible for a service&#39;s reliability, or as reliability subject-matter experts, is a key indicator of SRE-hood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle #1: SREs mitigate present and &lt;i&gt;future&lt;/i&gt; incidents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This principle is the one that usually underlies the perception of &lt;b&gt;responsibility and accountability&lt;/b&gt; for a service&#39;s reliability. All the careful engineering and active regulation in the world can&#39;t guarantee reliability, especially in complex distributed systems—sometimes, things go wrong unexpectedly and the only thing left to do is react, mitigate, and fix. SREs have both the authority and the technical capability to act fast to restore service in these situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mitigating the immediate problem isn&#39;t enough. If it can happen again tomorrow, then tomorrow isn&#39;t better than today, so SREs should work to understand the precipitating factors of incidents and propose changes that remediate the entire class of problem in the infrastructure they are responsible for. Don&#39;t have the same outage again next month!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How unique are your outages? Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you mitigate the majority of the incidents without needing specialist knowledge from the development team?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you maintain training materials and practice incident response scenarios?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a major outage happens to your service, are you a key participant in blamelessly figuring out what &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; went wrong, and how to prevent future outages?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, for a counter example. In many organizations, SREs are a scarce resource and may add more value by developing platforms and best practices to uplift large swathes of the company, rather than being primarily focused on incident response. Thus, a consulting SRE team would probably not be directly involved in mitigating most incidents, though they may be called on to coordinate incident response for a widespread outage. Rather than authoring training materials and postmortems, they would be responsible for reviewing those created by the teams they advise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle #2: SREs actively regulate service reliability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reliability goals and feedback signals are fundamental for both motivating SRE work and influencing the prioritization of development work.&lt;/b&gt; At Google, we call our reliability goals &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Service Level Objectives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and our feedback signals &lt;i&gt;Error Budgets&lt;/i&gt;, and you can read more about how we use them in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Site Reliability Workbook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do your reliability signals affect your organization&#39;s priorities? Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you agree on goals for the reliability of the services you support with your organization, and track performance against those goals in real time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have an established feedback loop that moderates the behaviour of the organization based on recent service reliability?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have the influence to effect change within the organization in pursuit of the reliability goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(sociology)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;agency&lt;/a&gt; to refuse, or negotiate looser goals, when asked to make changes that may cause a service to miss its current reliability goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each question builds on the last. It is almost impossible to establish a data-driven feedback loop without a well-defined and measured reliability goal. For those goals to be meaningful, SREs must have the capability to defend them. Periods of lower service reliability should result in consequences that temporarily reduce the aggregate risk of future production changes and shift engineering priorities towards reliability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to a choice between service reliability and the rollout of new but unreliable features, SREs need to be able to say &#34;no&#34;. This should be a data driven decision—when there&#39;s not enough spare error budget, there needs to be a valid business reason for making users unhappy. Sometimes, of course, there will be, and this can be accommodated with new, lower SLO targets that reflect the relaxed reliability requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consultant SREs, in contrast, help teams draft their reliability goals and may develop shared monitoring infrastructure for measuring them across the organization. They are the de-facto regulators of the reliability feedback loop and maintain the policy documents that underpin it. Their connection to many teams and services gives them broader insights that can spark cross-functional reliability improvements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle #3: SREs engage early and comprehensively&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we said earlier, &lt;b&gt;SREs should be empowered to make tomorrow better than today.&lt;/b&gt; Without the ability to change the code and configuration of the services they support, they cannot fix problems as they encounter them. Involving SREs earlier in the design process can head off common reliability anti-patterns that are costly to correct &lt;i&gt;post-facto&lt;/i&gt;. And, with the ability to influence architectural decision making, SREs can drive convergence across an organization so that work to increase the reliability of one service can benefit the entire company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your team actively working to make tomorrow better than today? Ask yourself these questions, which go from fine detail to a broad, high-level scope:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you engineer your service &lt;b&gt;now&lt;/b&gt; to improve its reliability, e.g. by viewing and modifying the source code and/or configuration?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you involved in analysis and design of &lt;b&gt;future&lt;/b&gt; iterations of your service, providing a lens on reliability/operability/maintainability?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you influence your &lt;b&gt;organization’s&lt;/b&gt; wider architectural decision making?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advising other teams naturally shifts priorities away from directly modifying the configuration or code of individual services. But consultant SREs may still maintain frameworks or shared libraries providing core reliability features, like exporting common metrics or graceful service degradation. Their breadth of engagements across many teams makes them naturally suited for providing high-level architectural advice to improve reliability across an entire organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle #4: SREs automate anything repetitive&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, SREs believe that computers are fundamentally better suited to doing repetitive work than humans are. People often underestimate the &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/1205/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;returns on investment&lt;/a&gt; when considering whether to automate a routine task, and that&#39;s before factoring in the exponential growth curve that comes with running a large, successful service. Moreover, computers never become inattentive and make mistakes when doing the same task for the hundredth time, or become demoralized and quit. Hiring or &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/resources/practices-and-processes/training-site-reliability-engineers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;training SREs&lt;/a&gt; is expensive and time-consuming, so a successful SRE organization depends heavily on making computers do the grunt work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you sufficiently automating your work? Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you use—or create—automation and other tools to ensure that operational load won&#39;t scale linearly with organic growth or the number of services you support?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you try to measure repetitive work on your team, and reduce it over time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A call for reflection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most blog posts end with a call for action. We&#39;d rather you took time to reflect, instead of jumping up to make changes straight after reading. &lt;b&gt;There&#39;s a risk, when writing an opinionated piece like this, that the lines drawn in the sand are used to divide, not to grow and improve.&lt;/b&gt; We promise this isn&#39;t a deliberate effort to gatekeep SRE and exclude those who don&#39;t tick the boxes; we see no value in that. But in some ways gatekeeping is what job roles are &lt;i&gt;designed&lt;/i&gt; to do, because specialization and the division of labour is critical to the success of any organization, and this makes it hard to avoid drawing those lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who aspire to call themselves SREs, or are concerned that others may disagree with their characterization of themselves as SREs, perhaps these opinions can assuage some of that existential dread.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

They&#39;re subject-matter experts who are &lt;i&gt;Consulted&lt;/i&gt; by development teams who are themselves &lt;i&gt;Responsible&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Accountable&lt;/i&gt; for service reliability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever your engagement model lies on the spectrum, being perceived by the rest of the organization as jointly responsible for a service&#39;s reliability, or as reliability subject-matter experts, is a key indicator of SRE-hood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle #1: SREs mitigate present and &lt;i&gt;future&lt;/i&gt; incidents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This principle is the one that usually underlies the perception of &lt;b&gt;responsibility and accountability&lt;/b&gt; for a service&#39;s reliability. All the careful engineering and active regulation in the world can&#39;t guarantee reliability, especially in complex distributed systems&amp;#8212;sometimes, things go wrong unexpectedly and the only thing left to do is react, mitigate, and fix. SREs have both the authority and the technical capability to act fast to restore service in these situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But mitigating the immediate problem isn&#39;t enough. If it can happen again tomorrow, then tomorrow isn&#39;t better than today, so SREs should work to understand the precipitating factors of incidents and propose changes that remediate the entire class of problem in the infrastructure they are responsible for. Don&#39;t have the same outage again next month!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How unique are your outages? Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you mitigate the majority of the incidents without needing specialist knowledge from the development team?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you maintain training materials and practice incident response scenarios?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a major outage happens to your service, are you a key participant in blamelessly figuring out what &lt;b&gt;really&lt;/b&gt; went wrong, and how to prevent future outages?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, for a counter example. In many organizations, SREs are a scarce resource and may add more value by developing platforms and best practices to uplift large swathes of the company, rather than being primarily focused on incident response. Thus, a consulting SRE team would probably not be directly involved in mitigating most incidents, though they may be called on to coordinate incident response for a widespread outage. Rather than authoring training materials and postmortems, they would be responsible for reviewing those created by the teams they advise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle #2: SREs actively regulate service reliability&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reliability goals and feedback signals are fundamental for both motivating SRE work and influencing the prioritization of development work.&lt;/b&gt; At Google, we call our reliability goals &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Service Level Objectives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and our feedback signals &lt;i&gt;Error Budgets&lt;/i&gt;, and you can read more about how we use them in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/workbook/implementing-slos/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Site Reliability Workbook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do your reliability signals affect your organization&#39;s priorities? Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you agree on goals for the reliability of the services you support with your organization, and track performance against those goals in real time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have an established feedback loop that moderates the behaviour of the organization based on recent service reliability?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have the influence to effect change within the organization in pursuit of the reliability goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agency_(sociology)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;agency&lt;/a&gt; to refuse, or negotiate looser goals, when asked to make changes that may cause a service to miss its current reliability goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each question builds on the last. It is almost impossible to establish a data-driven feedback loop without a well-defined and measured reliability goal. For those goals to be meaningful, SREs must have the capability to defend them. Periods of lower service reliability should result in consequences that temporarily reduce the aggregate risk of future production changes and shift engineering priorities towards reliability.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes down to a choice between service reliability and the rollout of new but unreliable features, SREs need to be able to say &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;. This should be a data driven decision&amp;#8212;when there&#39;s not enough spare error budget, there needs to be a valid business reason for making users unhappy. Sometimes, of course, there will be, and this can be accommodated with new, lower SLO targets that reflect the relaxed reliability requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consultant SREs, in contrast, help teams draft their reliability goals and may develop shared monitoring infrastructure for measuring them across the organization. They are the de-facto regulators of the reliability feedback loop and maintain the policy documents that underpin it. Their connection to many teams and services gives them broader insights that can spark cross-functional reliability improvements.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle #3: SREs engage early and comprehensively&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we said earlier, &lt;b&gt;SREs should be empowered to make tomorrow better than today.&lt;/b&gt; Without the ability to change the code and configuration of the services they support, they cannot fix problems as they encounter them. Involving SREs earlier in the design process can head off common reliability anti-patterns that are costly to correct &lt;i&gt;post-facto&lt;/i&gt;. And, with the ability to influence architectural decision making, SREs can drive convergence across an organization so that work to increase the reliability of one service can benefit the entire company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your team actively working to make tomorrow better than today? Ask yourself these questions, which go from fine detail to a broad, high-level scope:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you engineer your service &lt;b&gt;now&lt;/b&gt; to improve its reliability, e.g. by viewing and modifying the source code and/or configuration?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you involved in analysis and design of &lt;b&gt;future&lt;/b&gt; iterations of your service, providing a lens on reliability/operability/maintainability?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can you influence your &lt;b&gt;organization&amp;#8217;s&lt;/b&gt; wider architectural decision making?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advising other teams naturally shifts priorities away from directly modifying the configuration or code of individual services. But consultant SREs may still maintain frameworks or shared libraries providing core reliability features, like exporting common metrics or graceful service degradation. Their breadth of engagements across many teams makes them naturally suited for providing high-level architectural advice to improve reliability across an entire organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Principle #4: SREs automate anything repetitive&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, SREs believe that computers are fundamentally better suited to doing repetitive work than humans are. People often underestimate the &lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/1205/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;returns on investment&lt;/a&gt; when considering whether to automate a routine task, and that&#39;s before factoring in the exponential growth curve that comes with running a large, successful service. Moreover, computers never become inattentive and make mistakes when doing the same task for the hundredth time, or become demoralized and quit. Hiring or &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/resources/practices-and-processes/training-site-reliability-engineers/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;training SREs&lt;/a&gt; is expensive and time-consuming, so a successful SRE organization depends heavily on making computers do the grunt work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you sufficiently automating your work? Ask yourself these questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you use&amp;#8212;or create&amp;#8212;automation and other tools to ensure that operational load won&#39;t scale linearly with organic growth or the number of services you support?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you try to measure repetitive work on your team, and reduce it over time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A call for reflection&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most blog posts end with a call for action. We&#39;d rather you took time to reflect, instead of jumping up to make changes straight after reading. &lt;b&gt;There&#39;s a risk, when writing an opinionated piece like this, that the lines drawn in the sand are used to divide, not to grow and improve.&lt;/b&gt; We promise this isn&#39;t a deliberate effort to gatekeep SRE and exclude those who don&#39;t tick the boxes; we see no value in that. But in some ways gatekeeping is what job roles are &lt;i&gt;designed&lt;/i&gt; to do, because specialization and the division of labour is critical to the success of any organization, and this makes it hard to avoid drawing those lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those who aspire to call themselves SREs, or are concerned that others may disagree with their characterization of themselves as SREs, perhaps these opinions can assuage some of that existential dread.&lt;/p&gt;" _nghost-c19=""><p>One facet of our work as <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/introducing-a-new-era-of-customer-support-google-customer-reliability-engineering" track-type="inline link" track-name="1" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/introducing-a-new-era-of-customer-support-google-customer-reliability-engineering" track-metadata-module="post">Customer Reliability Engineers</a>—Google Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) tapped to help Google Cloud customers develop that practice in their own organizations—is advising operations or SRE teams to improve their operational maturity. We&#39;ve noticed a recurring question cropping up across many of these discussions, usually phrased along the lines of &#34;is what we&#39;re currently doing <i>&#39;SRE work&#39;?&#34;</i> or, with a little more existential dread, &#34;can we call ourselves SREs yet?&#34;</p><p>We&#39;ve answered this question before with a <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/how-to-start-and-assess-your-sre-journey" track-type="inline link" track-name="2" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/how-to-start-and-assess-your-sre-journey" track-metadata-module="post">list of practices</a> from the <a href="https://sre.google/workbook/table-of-contents/" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="3" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://sre.google" track-metadata-module="post">SRE workbook</a>. But the list is long on the <i>what</i> and short on the <i>why</i>, which can make it hard to digest for folks already suffering an identity crisis. Instead, we hope to help answer this question by discussing some principles we consider fundamental to how an SRE team operates. We&#39;ll examine why they&#39;re important and suggest questions that characterize a team&#39;s progress towards embodying them. </p><h2>Are we there yet?</h2><p>This question is asked in different ways, for a myriad of different reasons, and it can be quite hard to answer due to the wide range of <a href="https://web.devopstopologies.com/" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="4" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://web.devopstopologies.com" track-metadata-module="post">different circumstances</a> that our customers operate in. Moreover, CRE, and Google in general, is not the final arbiter of what is and isn&#39;t &#34;SRE&#34; for your organization, so we can&#39;t provide an authoritative answer, if one even exists. We can only influence you and the community at large by expressing our opinions and experiences, in person or via our <a href="https://sre.google/books/" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="5" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://sre.google" track-metadata-module="post">books</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/cre-life-lessons" track-type="inline link" track-name="6" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/cre-life-lessons" track-metadata-module="post">blog posts</a>. </p><p>Further, discussions of this topic tend to be complicated by the fact that the term &#34;SRE&#34; is used interchangeably to mean three things:</p><ol><li><p>A <b>job role</b> primarily focused on maintaining the reliability of a service or product.</p></li><li><p>A <b>group of people </b>working within an organization, usually in the above job role.</p></li><li><p>A <b>set of principles and practices</b> that the above people can utilize to improve service reliability.</p></li></ol><p>When people ask &#34;can we call ourselves SREs yet?&#34; we could interpret it as a desire to link these three definitions together. A clearer restatement of this interpretation might be: &#34;Is our <b>group</b> sufficiently advanced in our application of the <b>principles and practices</b> that we can justifiably term our <b>job role</b> SRE?&#34; </p><p>We should stress that we&#39;re not saying that you need a clearly defined <b>job role</b>—or even a <b>team</b>—before you can start utilizing the <b>principles and practices</b> to do things that are recognizably SRE-like. Job roles and teams crystallize from a more fluid set of responsibilities as organizations grow larger. But as this process plays out, the people involved may feel less certain of the scope of their responsibilities, precipitating the ‘are we there yet?’ question. We suspect that&#39;s where the tone of existential dread comes from...</p><h2>Key SRE indicators</h2><p>Within the CRE team here at Google Cloud, the ‘are we there yet?’ question surfaced a wide variety of opinions about the core principles that should guide an SRE team. We did manage to reach a rough consensus, with one proviso—the answer is partially dependent on how a team engages with the services it supports.</p><p>We&#39;ve chosen to structure this post around a set of principles that we would broadly expect groups of people working as SREs that <i>directly support services in production</i> to adhere to. As in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litmus#Uses" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="7" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://en.wikipedia.org" track-metadata-module="post">litmus test</a>, this won&#39;t provide pin-point accuracy; but in our collective opinion at least, alignment with most of the principles laid out below is a good signal that a team is practicing something that can recognizably be termed <i>Site Reliability Engineering.</i></p><p>Directly engaged SRE teams are usually considered <i>Accountable</i> (in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="8" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://en.wikipedia.org" track-metadata-module="post">RACI terms</a>) for the service’s reliability, with <i>Responsibility</i> shared between the SRE and development teams. As a team provides less direct support these indicators may be less applicable. We hope those teams can still adapt the principles to their own circumstances. </p><p>To illustrate how you might do this, for each principle we&#39;ve given a counter-example of a team of SREs operating in an advisory capacity. They&#39;re subject-matter experts who are <i>Consulted</i> by development teams who are themselves <i>Responsible</i> and <i>Accountable</i> for service reliability.</p><p>Wherever your engagement model lies on the spectrum, being perceived by the rest of the organization as jointly responsible for a service&#39;s reliability, or as reliability subject-matter experts, is a key indicator of SRE-hood.</p><h3>Principle #1: SREs mitigate present and <i>future</i> incidents</h3><p>This principle is the one that usually underlies the perception of <b>responsibility and accountability</b> for a service&#39;s reliability. All the careful engineering and active regulation in the world can&#39;t guarantee reliability, especially in complex distributed systems—sometimes, things go wrong unexpectedly and the only thing left to do is react, mitigate, and fix. SREs have both the authority and the technical capability to act fast to restore service in these situations.</p><p>But mitigating the immediate problem isn&#39;t enough.

      <title>Node, Python and Java repositories now available in Artifact Registry</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/artifact-registry-adds-node-python-and-java-repositories/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a developer, you need a secure place to store all your stuff: container images of course, but also language packages that can enable code reuse across multiple applications. Today, we’re pleased to announce support for Node.js, Python and Java repositories for &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry&#34;&gt;Artifact Registry&lt;/a&gt; in Preview. With today’s announcement, you can not only use Artifact Registry to secure and distribute container images, but also manage and secure your other software artifacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the Artifact Registry managed service provides advantages over on-premises registries. As a fully serverless platform, it scales based on demand, so you only pay for what you actually use. Enterprise security features such as VPC-SC, CMEK, and granular IAM ensure you get greater control and security features for both container and non-container artifacts. You can also connect to tools you are already using as a part of a CI/CD workflow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at the features you’ll find in Artifact Registry, giving you a fully-managed tool to store, manage, and secure all your artifacts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Expanded repository formats&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;With support for new repository formats, you can streamline and get a consistent view across all your artifacts.

      <title>How Lowe’s meets customer demand with Google SRE practices</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/how-lowes-leverages-google-sre-practices/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor’s note:&lt;/b&gt; Today we hear from the Lowe’s SRE team. They share about how they have been able to increase the number of releases they can support by adopting Google’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Site Reliability Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (SRE) framework and leveraging their partnership with Google Cloud. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Lowe’s, we’ve made significant progress in our multiyear technology transformation. To modernize our systems and build new capabilities for our customers and associates, we leverage Google’s SRE framework and Google Cloud, which helps us meet their needs faster and more effectively. With these efforts, we’ve been able to go from one release every two weeks to 20+ releases daily—a 300x increase. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our SRE transformation didn’t happen overnight, though. Every step along the way brought some challenges. But looking back, we are excited to see how much we have accomplished for our customers as a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2018, before adopting SRE practices, we were more reactive than proactive, following an “eyes on glass” approach. On-call structures and incident management efficiency were not at optimal levels with too many repetitive and manual tasks, resulting in operational toil. Production concerns were not surfaced into the product roadmap, which resulted in delays in making fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bootstrapping SRE at Lowe’s&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we moved from on-prem to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to move from a monolithic- to microservices-based architecture. And to better manage this new architecture, we embarked on an SRE journey. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then as COVID-19 hit, we really had to accelerate this journey as customers increasingly moved to online ordering and delivery to meet their Total Home Improvement needs. To do so, we followed four key principles that allowed us to meet changing customer needs quickly and release fast and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Automate away toil &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;As we moved from traditional Ops to an SRE ecosystem, our biggest opportunity was &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reducing toil&lt;/a&gt;, so that engineers can spend time on activities that drive business impact and customer outcomes. We think of toil as work that is manual, repetitive,  tactical, devoid of enduring value—but automatable. So, to tackle toil, we focused on automating away the need for manual intervention. As an example, we made sure engineers were not the first point of contact for any alert. Any triage or resolution that an engineer can perform, a machine can be trained to do the same. We used supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to automate our toil. With a long-term goal of “no toil,” our SREs work on identifying and reducing toil to a manageable level across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engineer alignment through roadmaps&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Our goal is to maximize the engineering velocity of developer teams while keeping products reliable. We want an engagement model where product, SRE and development teams are closely aligned. A key way we’ve been able to create this alignment is by having our SREs embedded into domain and product teams. Each domain has an SRE, who is  involved at the beginning stages of product development to ensure that the domain stakeholders are in alignment with the SRE initiatives. As such, SREs are able to improve the reliability, performance, scalability and launch velocity of the services throughout all phases of the service lifecycle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adopt one-touch releases&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Our path to production used to contain many manual steps and validations, slowing the rate at which we released features. Additionally, we used to bulk all our releases together to deploy at once, which increased the risk of failure and created a longer feedback loop from production. To tackle this with an SRE mindset, we created a one-touch release process in which SREs review the product team’s pull requests. When approved, this triggers a DevSecOps pipeline that deploys the approved changes to production securely. This process created a safe, reliable and sustainable continuous delivery pipeline with quick feedback loops. Striking the right balance between speed, innovation and stability, we were able to increase our releases exponentially for the year, taking less than 30 minutes per release to deliver quality code, including various automated quality checks and processes, all in just one click. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Embrace capacity planning&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;To ensure our services have enough spare capacity to handle any surge in traffic patterns, our SREs emphasize capacity planning, making recommended capacity changes in the continuous delivery (CD) pipeline. They constantly &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/monitoring&#34;&gt;monitor performance&lt;/a&gt; to make sure the service is robust, stable and available. And when there’s a sudden surge beyond the forecasted volume, SREs change the capacity on demand and document changes for the performance and domain teams. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capacity planning is especially important for us during peak holiday times such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday (BFCM). We lay out our SRE stability plan three months in advance and surface into the domain team’s product roadmap. This way development teams are able to allocate sufficient engineering time to reliability. We do performance testing to ensure the environment is able to sustain increased load over long periods of time and also handle sudden surges in traffic. We also do region failover testing at a global scale to validate the automatic failover duration of service level agreements  (SLAs), SRE and domain readiness. Additionally, we conduct Black Friday and Cyber Monday-specific destructive testing to validate customer experience, reliability and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/solutions/retail&#34;&gt;white-glove service&lt;/a&gt; played a key role in ensuring our success in both BFCM 2019 and BFCM 2020. This service included on-site visits from Google’s Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE) team who reviewed Lowe’s web architecture, capacity planning, operations practices for event risks, and presented workshops on topics such as incident response best practices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is always room for improvement, and at Lowe’s we aim to continuously improve our SRE practices.

They share about how they have been able to increase the number of releases they can support by adopting Google&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Site Reliability Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (SRE) framework and leveraging their partnership with Google Cloud.&amp;#160;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Lowe&amp;#8217;s, we&amp;#8217;ve made significant progress in our multiyear technology transformation. To modernize our systems and build new capabilities for our customers and associates, we leverage Google&amp;#8217;s SRE framework and Google Cloud, which helps us meet their needs faster and more effectively. With these efforts, we&amp;#8217;ve been able to go from one release every two weeks to 20+ releases daily&amp;#8212;a 300x increase.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our SRE transformation didn&amp;#8217;t happen overnight, though. Every step along the way brought some challenges. But looking back, we are excited to see how much we have accomplished for our customers as a result.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in 2018, before adopting SRE practices, we were more reactive than proactive, following an &amp;#8220;eyes on glass&amp;#8221; approach. On-call structures and incident management efficiency were not at optimal levels with too many repetitive and manual tasks, resulting in operational toil. Production concerns were not surfaced into the product roadmap, which resulted in delays in making fixes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Bootstrapping SRE at Lowe&amp;#8217;s&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we moved from on-prem to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/&#34;&gt;Google Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, we decided to move from a monolithic- to microservices-based architecture. And to better manage this new architecture, we embarked on an SRE journey.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then as COVID-19 hit, we really had to accelerate this journey as customers increasingly moved to online ordering and delivery to meet their Total Home Improvement needs. To do so, we followed four key principles that allowed us to meet changing customer needs quickly and release fast and reliably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Automate away toil&amp;#160;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;As we moved from traditional Ops to an SRE ecosystem, our biggest opportunity was &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reducing toil&lt;/a&gt;, so that engineers can spend time on activities that drive business impact and customer outcomes. We think of toil as work that is manual, repetitive,&amp;#160; tactical, devoid of enduring value&amp;#8212;but automatable. So, to tackle toil, we focused on automating away the need for manual intervention. As an example, we made sure engineers were not the first point of contact for any alert. Any triage or resolution that an engineer can perform, a machine can be trained to do the same. We used supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to automate our toil. With a long-term goal of &amp;#8220;no toil,&amp;#8221; our SREs work on identifying and reducing toil to a manageable level across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Engineer alignment through roadmaps&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Our goal is to maximize the engineering velocity of developer teams while keeping products reliable. We want an engagement model where product, SRE and development teams are closely aligned. A key way we&amp;#8217;ve been able to create this alignment is by having our SREs embedded into domain and product teams. Each domain has an SRE, who is&amp;#160; involved at the beginning stages of product development to ensure that the domain stakeholders are in alignment with the SRE initiatives. As such, SREs are able to improve the reliability, performance, scalability and launch velocity of the services throughout all phases of the service lifecycle.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adopt one-touch releases&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Our path to production used to contain many manual steps and validations, slowing the rate at which we released features. Additionally, we used to bulk all our releases together to deploy at once, which increased the risk of failure and created a longer feedback loop from production. To tackle this with an SRE mindset, we created a one-touch release process in which SREs review the product team&amp;#8217;s pull requests. When approved, this triggers a DevSecOps pipeline that deploys the approved changes to production securely. This process created a safe, reliable and sustainable continuous delivery pipeline with quick feedback loops. Striking the right balance between speed, innovation and stability, we were able to increase our releases exponentially for the year, taking less than 30 minutes per release to deliver quality code, including various automated quality checks and processes, all in just one click.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Embrace capacity planning&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;To ensure our services have enough spare capacity to handle any surge in traffic patterns, our SREs emphasize capacity planning, making recommended capacity changes in the continuous delivery (CD) pipeline. They constantly &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/monitoring&#34;&gt;monitor performance&lt;/a&gt; to make sure the service is robust, stable and available. And when there&amp;#8217;s a sudden surge beyond the forecasted volume, SREs change the capacity on demand and document changes for the performance and domain teams.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capacity planning is especially important for us during peak holiday times such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday (BFCM). We lay out our SRE stability plan three months in advance and surface into the domain team&amp;#8217;s product roadmap. This way development teams are able to allocate sufficient engineering time to reliability. We do performance testing to ensure the environment is able to sustain increased load over long periods of time and also handle sudden surges in traffic. We also do region failover testing at a global scale to validate the automatic failover duration of service level agreements&amp;#160; (SLAs), SRE and domain readiness. Additionally, we conduct Black Friday and Cyber Monday-specific destructive testing to validate customer experience, reliability and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Cloud&amp;#8217;s Black Friday and Cyber Monday &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/solutions/retail&#34;&gt;white-glove service&lt;/a&gt; played a key role in ensuring our success in both BFCM 2019 and BFCM 2020. This service included on-site visits from Google&amp;#8217;s Customer Reliability Engineering (CRE) team who reviewed Lowe&amp;#8217;s web architecture, capacity planning, operations practices for event risks, and presented workshops on topics such as incident response best practices.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking ahead&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is always room for improvement, and at Lowe&amp;#8217;s we aim to continuously improve our SRE practices.

      <title>DevOps on Google Cloud: tools to speed up software development velocity</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/forgerock-developers-stay-productive-with-google-cloud/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Editor’s note&lt;/b&gt;: Today we hear from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forgerock.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ForgeRock&lt;/a&gt;, a multinational &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_and_access_management&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;identity and access management&lt;/a&gt; software company with more than 1,100 enterprise customers, including a major public broadcaster. In total, customers use the ForgeRock Identity Platform to authenticate and log in over 45 million users daily, helping them manage identity, governance, and access management across all platforms, including on-premises and multicloud environments. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Operating at that kind of scale isn’t easy. In this blog post, ForgeRock Engineering Director, Warren Strange discusses the three things that help make their developers efficient and productive, and the Google Cloud tools they use along the way. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;p&gt;At ForgeRock, we’ve been an early adopter of Kubernetes, viewing it as a strategic platform. Running on Kubernetes allows us to drive multicloud support across &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/a&gt; (GKE), Amazon (EKS), and Azure (AKS). So no matter which cloud our customers are running on, we are able to seamlessly integrate our products into customers&#39; environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making it easier for ForgeRock&#39;s developers and operators to build, deploy and manage applications has been crucial in our ability to continually provide high quality solutions for our customers. We’re always looking for tools to improve productivity and keep our developers focused on coding instead of configuration. Google Cloud’s suite of DevOps tools have streamlined three specific practices to help keep our developers productive: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Make developers productive within IDEs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developer productivity is core to the success of any organization, including ForgeRock. Since developers spend most of their time within their IDE of choice, our goal at ForgeRock has been to make it easier for our developers to write Kubernetes applications within the IDEs they know and love. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/code&#34;&gt;Cloud Code&lt;/a&gt; helps us precisely with that: it makes the process of building, deploying, scaling, and managing Kubernetes infrastructure and applications a breeze. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, working with the Kubernetes YAML syntax and schema takes time, and a lot of trial and error to master. Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/yaml-editing&#34;&gt;YAML authoring support&lt;/a&gt; within Cloud Code, we can easily avoid the complicated and time consuming task of writing YAML files at ForgeRock. With YAML authoring support, developers save time on every bug. Cloud Code’s inline  snippets, completions, and schema validation, a.k.a. “linting,” further streamline working with YAML files. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of Cloud Code extend to local development as well. Iterating locally on Kubernetes applications often requires multiple manual steps, including building container images, updating Kubernetes manifests, and redeploying applications. Doing these steps over and over again can be a chore. Cloud Code &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/intellij/deploying-a-k8-app&#34;&gt;supports Skaffold under the hood,&lt;/a&gt; which tracks changes as they come and automatically rebuilds and redeploys—reducing repetitive development tasks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, developing for Kubernetes usually involves jumping between the IDE, documentation, samples etc. Cloud Code reduces this context switching with Kubernetes &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-code-samples&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;code samples&lt;/a&gt;. With samples, we can get new developers up and running quickly. They spend less time learning about configuration and management of the application—and spend more time on writing and evolving the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Drive end-to-end automation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further improve developer productivity, we’ve focused on end-to-end automation: from writing code within IDEs, to automatically triggering CI/CD pipelines and running the code in production. In particular, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/tekton&#34;&gt;Tekton&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build&#34;&gt;Cloud Build&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/container-registry&#34;&gt;Container Registry,&lt;/a&gt; and GKE have been critical to Forgerock as we streamline the flow of code, feedback and remediation through the build and deployment processes. The process looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/ForgeRock__Google.0997050516950896.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;ForgeRock + Google.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/ForgeRock__Google.0997050516950896.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We begin by developing Kubernetes manifests and dockerfiles using Cloud Code. Then we use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/kubernetes-development-simplified-skaffold-is-now-ga&#34;&gt;Skaffold&lt;/a&gt; to build containers locally, while Cloud Build helps with continuous integration (CI). The &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/marketplace/google-cloud-build&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud Build GitHub app&lt;/a&gt; allows us to automate builds and tests as part of our GitHub workflow. Cloud Build is differentiated from other continuous integration tools since it is fully serverless. It scales up and scales down in response to load, with no need for us to pre-provision servers or pay in advance for additional capacity. We pay for the exact resources we use. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the image is built by Cloud Build, it is stored, managed, and secured in Google’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/container-registry&#34;&gt;Container Registry&lt;/a&gt;. Just like Cloud Build, Container Registry is serverless, so we only pay for what we  use. Additionally, since Container Registry comes with automatic vulnerability scanning, every time we upload a new image to Container Registry, we can also scan it for vulnerabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, a Tekton pipeline is triggered, which deploys the docker images stored in Container Registry and Kubernetes manifests to a running GKE cluster. Along with Cloud Build, Tekton is a critical part of our CI/CD process at ForgeRock. Most importantly, since Tekton comes with standardized Kubernetes-native primitives, we can create continuous delivery workflows very quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After deployment, Tekton triggers a functional test suite to ensure that the applications we deploy perform as expected. The test results are posted to our team Slack channel so all developers have instant access and insights about each cluster. From there, we are able to provide our customers with their finished product request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3.  Leverage multicloud patterns and practices&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry has seen a shift towards &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/multicloud&#34;&gt;multicloud&lt;/a&gt;. Organizations have adopted multicloud strategies to minimize vendor lock-in, take advantage of best-in-class solutions, improve cost-efficiencies, and increase flexibility through choice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At ForgeRock, we’re big proponents of multicloud. Part of that comes from the fact that our identity and access management product works across Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure. Developing products using open-source technologies such as Kubernetes has been particularly helpful in driving this interoperability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tekton has been another critical project that has allowed us to prevent vendor lock-in. Thanks to Tekton, our continuous delivery pipelines can deploy across any Kubernetes cluster. Most importantly, since Tekton pipelines run on Kubernetes, these pipelines can be decoupled from the runtime. Like Tekton and Kubernetes, both Cloud Build and Container Registry are based on open technologies. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Community-contributed builders&lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;official builder images&lt;/a&gt; allow us to connect to a variety of tools as a part of the build process. And finally, with support for open technologies like &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/google-cloud-now-supports-buildpacks&#34;&gt;Google Cloud buildpacks&lt;/a&gt; within Cloud Build, we can build containers without even knowing Docker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making it easier for developers and operators to build, deploy and manage applications is critical for the success of any organization. Driving developer productivity within IDEs, leveraging end-to-end automation, and support for multi-cloud patterns and practices are just some of the ways we are trying to achieve this at ForgeRock.

In this blog post, ForgeRock Engineering Director, Warren Strange discusses the three things that help make their developers efficient and productive, and the Google Cloud tools they use along the way.&amp;#160;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;At ForgeRock, we&amp;#8217;ve been an early adopter of Kubernetes, viewing it as a strategic platform. Running on Kubernetes allows us to drive multicloud support across &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;Google Kubernetes Engine&lt;/a&gt; (GKE), Amazon (EKS), and Azure (AKS). So no matter which cloud our customers are running on, we are able to seamlessly integrate our products into customers&#39; environments.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making it easier for ForgeRock&#39;s developers and operators to build, deploy and manage applications has been crucial in our ability to continually provide high quality solutions for our customers. We&amp;#8217;re always looking for tools to improve productivity and keep our developers focused on coding instead of configuration. Google Cloud&amp;#8217;s suite of DevOps tools have streamlined three specific practices to help keep our developers productive:&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Make developers productive within IDEs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developer productivity is core to the success of any organization, including ForgeRock. Since developers spend most of their time within their IDE of choice, our goal at ForgeRock has been to make it easier for our developers to write Kubernetes applications within the IDEs they know and love. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/code&#34;&gt;Cloud Code&lt;/a&gt; helps us precisely with that: it makes the process of building, deploying, scaling, and managing Kubernetes infrastructure and applications a breeze.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, working with the Kubernetes YAML syntax and schema takes time, and a lot of trial and error to master. Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/vscode/yaml-editing&#34;&gt;YAML authoring support&lt;/a&gt; within Cloud Code, we can easily avoid the complicated and time consuming task of writing YAML files at ForgeRock. With YAML authoring support, developers save time on every bug. Cloud Code&amp;#8217;s inline&amp;#160; snippets, completions, and schema validation, a.k.a. &amp;#8220;linting,&amp;#8221; further streamline working with YAML files.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of Cloud Code extend to local development as well. Iterating locally on Kubernetes applications often requires multiple manual steps, including building container images, updating Kubernetes manifests, and redeploying applications. Doing these steps over and over again can be a chore. Cloud Code &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/code/docs/intellij/deploying-a-k8-app&#34;&gt;supports Skaffold under the hood,&lt;/a&gt; which tracks changes as they come and automatically rebuilds and redeploys&amp;#8212;reducing repetitive development tasks.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, developing for Kubernetes usually involves jumping between the IDE, documentation, samples etc. Cloud Code reduces this context switching with Kubernetes &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-code-samples&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;code samples&lt;/a&gt;. With samples, we can get new developers up and running quickly. They spend less time learning about configuration and management of the application&amp;#8212;and spend more time on writing and evolving the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Drive end-to-end automation&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further improve developer productivity, we&amp;#8217;ve focused on end-to-end automation: from writing code within IDEs, to automatically triggering CI/CD pipelines and running the code in production.

      <title>Four steps to jumpstarting your SRE practice</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/four-steps-to-jumpstarting-your-sre-practice/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we wrote about how the first step to implementing Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) in an organization is &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-success-starts-with-getting-leadership-on-board&#34;&gt;getting leadership on board&lt;/a&gt;. So, let’s assume that you’ve gone ahead and done that. Now what? What are some concrete steps you can take to get the SRE ball rolling? In this blog post, we’ll take a look at what you as an IT leader can do to fast-track SRE within your team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 1: Start small and iterate &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Rome wasn&#39;t built in a day,&#34; the saying goes, but you do need to start somewhere. When it comes to implementing SRE principles, the approach that I (and my team) found to be the most effective is to start with a proof of concept, learn from our mistakes, and iterate!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Start by identifying a relevant application and/or team &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that go into choosing a specific team or application for your SRE proof of concept. Most of the time, though, this is a strategic decision for the organization, which is outside the scope of this article. Possible candidates can be a team shifting from traditional operations or DevOps to SRE, or a need to increase reliability to a business-critical product. No matter the reason, it’s crucial to select an application that is:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critical to the business. Your customers should care deeply about its uptime and reliability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently in development. Pick an application in which the business is actively investing resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world, the application provides data and metrics regarding its behaviour. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, stay away from proprietary software. If the application wasn’t built by you, it&#39;s not a good candidate for SRE! You need the ability to make strategic decisions about—and engineering changes to—the application as needed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pro tip&lt;/b&gt;: In general, if you have workloads both on-premises and in the cloud, try to start with the cloud-based app. If your engineers come from a traditional operations environment, changing their thinking away from &#39;bare metal&#39; and infrastructure metrics will be easier for a cloud-based app, as managed infrastructure turns practitioners into users and forces them to consume it like developers (APIs, infrastructure as code, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Remember&lt;/b&gt;: Set realistic goals. Discouraging your team with unrealistic expectations early on will have a negative effect on the initiative. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 2: Empower your teams&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing SRE principles requires fostering a learning culture, and in that regard, &lt;b&gt;team enablement&lt;/b&gt; means both training them, i.e., in regards to knowledge, as well as &lt;i&gt;empowering&lt;/i&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a training program is a topic in and of itself, but it’s important to think about an &lt;b&gt;enablement strategy&lt;/b&gt; at an early stage. Especially in large organizations, you need to address topics like internal upskilling, hiring and scaling the team as well as onboarding and creating a learning community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your enablement strategy should also accommodate employees at different levels and in different functions. For example, higher leadership&#39;s training will look very different from practitioners’ training. Leadership&#39;s education should be sufficient to get buy-in and to be able to make organizational decisions. To drive change in the entire organization, additional training to leadership on cultural concepts and practices might be required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout_external&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to engineering leadership and/or middle management (managers that manage managers), training should be a combination of  high-level cultural concepts to help foster the required culture, and technical SRE practices that are deep enough to understand prioritization, resource allocation, process creation, and future needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to practitioners, ideally you want the entire organization to be aligned both from a knowledge perspective as well as culturally. But as we’ve mentioned earlier, it’s best to start simple, with just one team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The starting point for those teams should be to understand reliability and key concepts like &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos&#34;&gt;SLAs, SLOs, SLIs&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/sre-error-budgets-and-maintenance-windows&#34;&gt;error budgets&lt;/a&gt;. These are important because SRE is focused on the customer experience. Measuring whether systems meet customer expectations requires a shift in mindset and can take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout_external&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;After identifying your first application and/or the team responsible for it, it&#39;s time to identify the app’s user journeys, the set of interactions a user has with a service to achieve a single goal—for example, a single click or a multi-step pipeline, and rank them according to business impact. The most critical ones are called Critical User Journeys (CUJ), and these are where you should start  drafting SLO/SLIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_kqBt6Vr.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;image1.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/image1_kqBt6Vr.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pro tip&lt;/b&gt;: There are some general technical practices that can help you embrace SRE faster. For example, using less repos rather than more can help you reduce silos within the organization and better utilize resources. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise, prioritizing automatic processes and self-healing systems can benefit reliability, but also team satisfaction, helping the organization retain talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout_external&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final note&lt;/b&gt;: Similar to the way that you make architecture decisions, your chosen technology, solutions and implementation tools should enable you to do what you are trying to do and not vice versa. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 3: Scale those learnings &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you establish these SRE practices with one or a few teams, the next step is to think about building an SRE community and formalized processes across the organization. In some organizations, you can do this in parallel to the end of step 2, and in some organizations, only after you have a few successful implementations under your belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this phase, you’ll probably want to address &lt;b&gt;community, culture, enablement and processes.&lt;/b&gt; You will need to address them all, especially as they are intertwined, but which one you prioritize will depend on your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creating an SRE &lt;b&gt;community&lt;/b&gt; in the organization is important both from a learning perspective, but also to establish a knowledge base of best practices, train subject-matter experts, help create needed guardrails, and align processes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a community goes hand in hand with fostering an &lt;b&gt;empowered culture and training teams&lt;/b&gt;. The idea is that early adopters are ambassadors for SRE who share their learnings and train other teams in the organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also useful to identify potential ambassadors or champions in individual development teams who are passionate about SRE and will help with the adoption of those practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also crucial to create repeatable trainings for each functional role, including onboarding sessions. Onboarding new team members is a critical aspect of training and fostering an empowered SRE culture. Therefore it is vital to be mindful about your onboarding process and make sure that the knowledge is not lost when team members change roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout_external&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this phase, you also want to foster an org-wide culture that promotes psychological safety, accepts failure as normal and enables the team to learn from mistakes. For that, leadership must model the desired culture and promote transparency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, having structured and formalized processes can help reduce the stress around emergency response—especially being on-call. Processes can also provide clarity and make teams more collaborative and effective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to have the most impact, start by prioritizing the most painful areas under your team’s remit—for example, clean up noisy alerts to avoid (or address) alert fatigue, automate your change management processes and involve only the necessary people to save team bandwidth. Team members shouldn&#39;t work on software engineering projects while doing on-call incident management, and vice-versa. Make sure they have enough bandwidth to do both, separately.  Similar to other areas, you want to use data to drive your decisions.  As such, identify where your teams spend the most time, and for how long. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find that it is challenging to collect this kind of data, be it quantitative or qualitative, a good starting point is often your emergency response processes, as those have a direct impact on the business, especially around the escalation process, incident management and related policies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pro tip&lt;/b&gt;: All the above practices contribute to reducing silos and align goals across the organization; those should include also your vendors and engineering partners. To that end, make sure your contracts with them capture those goals as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Step 4: Embody a data-driven mindset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting the SRE journey can take time, even if you&#39;re just implementing it for one team. Two quick wins that you can start with that will make a positive impact are collecting data and doing blameless postmortems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In SRE we try to be as &lt;b&gt;data-driven&lt;/b&gt; as possible, so creating a measurement culture in your organization is crucial. When prioritizing data collection, ideally look for data that represents the customer experience. Collecting that data will help you identify your gaps and help you prioritize according to business needs and by extension your customer expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout_external&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing that you can do is run or improve &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;postmortems&lt;/a&gt;, which are an essential way of learning from failure and fostering a strong SRE culture. From our experience, even organizations that do run postmortems can benefit from them much more with a few minor improvements. It is important to remember that postmortems should be blameless in order to make the team feel safe to share and learn from failures. And to make tomorrow better than today, i.e., not repeat the same problems, it’s important that postmortems include action items and are assigned to an owner. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/fearless-shared-postmortems-cre-life-lessons&#34;&gt;Creating a shared repository&lt;/a&gt; for postmortems can have a tremendous impact on the team: it increases transparency, reduces silos, and contributes to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-learning-culture&#34;&gt;learning culture&lt;/a&gt;. It also shows the team that the organization “practices what it preaches.” Implementing a repository can be as easy as creating a shared drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pro ti&lt;/b&gt;p: Postmortems should be blameless and actionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout_external&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;nowrap&#34;&gt;Read Article&lt;svg class=&#34;icon h-c-icon&#34; role=&#34;presentation&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-arrow-forward&#34; xmlns:xlink=&#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;On the SRE fast track&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, no two organizations are alike, and no two SRE teams are either.

The end goal of our SRE principles is to improve services and in turn the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The concept of SRE starts with the idea that metrics should be closely tied to business objectives. In addition to business-level SLAs, we also use &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/availability-part-deux-cre-life-lessons&#34;&gt;SLOs and SLIs&lt;/a&gt; in SRE planning and practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Defining the terms of site reliability engineering&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tools aren’t just useful abstractions. Without them, you won’t know if your system is reliable, available, or even useful. If the tools don’t tie back to your business objectives, then you’ll be missing data on whether your choices are helping or hurting your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a refresher, here’s a look at SLOs, SLAs, and SLIS, as discussed by our Customer Reliability Engineering team in their blog post, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/availability-part-deux-cre-life-lessons&#34;&gt;SLOs, SLIs, SLAs, oh my - CRE life lessons&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Service-Level Objective (SLO)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;SRE begins with the idea that &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/embracing-risk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;availability is a prerequisite for success&lt;/a&gt;. An unavailable system can’t perform its function and will fail by default. Availability, in SRE terms, defines whether a system is able to fulfill its intended function at a point in time. In addition to its use as a reporting tool, the historical availability measurement can also describe the probability that your system will perform as expected in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we set out to define the terms of SRE, we wanted to set a precise numerical target for system availability. We term this target the availability &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Service-Level Objective&lt;/a&gt; (SLO) of our system. Any future discussion about whether the system is running reliably and if any design or architectural changes to it are needed must be framed in terms of our system continuing to meet this SLO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the more reliable the service, the more it costs to operate. Define the lowest level of reliability that is acceptable for users of each service, then state that as your SLO. Every service should have an availability SLO—without it, your team and your stakeholders can’t make principled judgments about whether your service needs to be made more reliable (increasing cost and slowing development) or less reliable (allowing greater velocity of development). Excessive availability has become the expectation, which can lead to problems. Don’t make your system overly reliable if the user experience doesn’t necessitate it, and especially if you don’t intend to commit to always reaching that level. You can learn more about this by participating in &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/resources/practices-and-processes/art-of-slos/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Art of SLOs&lt;/a&gt; training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Within Google Cloud, we implement periodic downtime in some services to prevent a service from being overly available. You could also try experimenting with occasional planned-downtime exercises with front-end servers, as we did with one of our internal systems. We found that these exercises can uncover services that are using those servers inappropriately. With that information, you can then move workloads to a more suitable place and keep servers at the right availability level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Service-Level Agreement (SLA)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Google Cloud, &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;we distinguish between an SLO and a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)&lt;/a&gt;. An SLA normally involves a promise to a service user that the service availability SLO should meet a certain level over a certain period. Failing to do so then results in some kind of penalty. This might be a partial refund of the service subscription fee paid by customers for that period, or additional subscription time added for free. Going out of SLO will hurt the service team, so they will push hard to stay within SLO. If you’re charging your customers money, you’ll probably need an SLA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of this, and because of the principle that availability shouldn’t be much better than the SLO, the availability SLO in the SLA is normally a looser objective than the internal availability SLO. This might be expressed in availability numbers: for instance, an availability SLO of 99.9% over one month, with an internal availability SLO of 99.95%. Alternatively, the SLA might only specify a subset of the metrics that make up the internal SLO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have an SLO in your SLA that is different from your internal SLO (as it almost always is), it’s important for your monitoring to explicitly measure SLO compliance. You want to be able to view your system’s availability over the SLA calendar period, and quickly see if it appears to be in danger of going out of SLO. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll also need a precise measurement of compliance, usually from logs analysis. Since we have an extra set of obligations (described in the SLA) to paying customers, we need to measure queries received from them separately from other queries. This is another benefit of establishing an SLA—it’s an unambiguous way to prioritize traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you define your SLA’s availability SLO, be careful about which queries you count as legitimate. For example, if a customer goes over quota because they released a buggy version of their mobile client, you may consider excluding all “out of quota” response codes from your SLA accounting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Service-Level Indicator (SLI)&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Service-Level Indicator (SLI) is a direct measurement of a service’s behavior, defined as the frequency of successful probes of our system. When we evaluate whether our system has been running within SLO for the past week, &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/tune-up-your-sli-metrics-cre-life-lessons&#34;&gt;we look at the SLI&lt;/a&gt; to get the service availability percentage. If it goes below the specified SLO, we have a problem and may need to make the system more available in some way, such as by running a second instance of the service in a different city and load-balancing between the two. If you want to know how reliable your service is, you must be able to measure the rates of successful and unsuccessful queries as your SLIs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re building a system from scratch, make sure that SLIs and SLOs are part of your system requirements. If you already have a production system but don’t have them clearly defined, then that’s your highest priority work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Monitoring_sZG2gQO.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;Cloud Monitoring.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Cloud_Monitoring_sZG2gQO.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-image__caption &#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/monitoring&#34;&gt;Cloud Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; provides predefined dashboards for the Google Cloud services that you use.

      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/take-2021-state-devops-survey-shape-future-devops/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Google Cloud and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devops-research.com/research.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DORA&lt;/a&gt; research team are excited to announce the launch of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cIb0SmhJPfm8H7n&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2021 State of DevOps survey&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cIb0SmhJPfm8H7n&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; takes approximately 25 minutes to complete and we’d love to hear from you. Your answers will allow us to better understand the practices that teams are employing to improve software delivery performance and inturn generate powerful business outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops#read-dora%E2%80%99s-state-of-devops-reports-and-devops-roi-whitepaper&#34;&gt;State of DevOps report&lt;/a&gt; by Google Cloud and the DORA research team is the largest and longest running research of its kind. It provides an independent view into the practices and capabilities that organizations, irrespective of their size, industry, and region can employ to drive better performance.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the past six research reports, our goal this year is to perform detailed analysis to help various teams benchmark their performance against the industry as elite, high, medium, or low performers. We also look to show specific strategies that teams can employ to improve their performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The table below highlights elite, high, medium, and low performers at a glance from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops&#34;&gt;last report.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;dora2&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Screen_Shot_2021-05-03_at_12.43.32_AM.max-1000x1000.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Achieving elite performance is a team endeavor and diverse, inclusive teams drive the best performance. The research program benefits from the participation of a diverse group of people. Please help us encourage more voices by sharing this survey with your network, especially with your colleagues from underrepresented parts of our industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cIb0SmhJPfm8H7n&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; is for everyone, regardless of where you are on your DevOps journey, the size of your organization, or your organization&#39;s industry. There are no right or wrong answers, in fact we often hear feedback that questions in the survey prompt ideas for improvement. Many of these ideas can be put into practice immediately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the key topics we look to deep dive into this year include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metrics and Measurement: Practices employed by high performing teams &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;SRE and DevOps: How do they fit together and how they impact performance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to best integrate security &amp;amp; compliance as a part of your app development &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of cloud, monitoring &amp;amp; observability, open source, and documentation on performance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distributed teams: Practices to improve work/life balance and reduce burnout&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state of multi-cloud computing &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help us shape the future of DevOps and make your voice heard by completing the &lt;a href=&#34;https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cIb0SmhJPfm8H7n&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;survey now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://google.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_cIb0SmhJPfm8H7n&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The survey&lt;/a&gt; will remain open until midnight PST on July 2, 2021. We look forward to hearing from you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</description>

Our goal with CRE was (and still is) to create a shared operational fate between Google and our Google Cloud customers, to give you more control over the critical applications you&#39;re entrusting to us. Since then, here on the Google Cloud blog, we’ve published a wealth of resources to help you take the best practices we’ve learned from SRE teams at Google and apply them in your own environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is the complete list of CRE life lessons posts we’ve published &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/cre-life-lessons&#34;&gt;in the past five years&lt;/a&gt; in one convenient location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Common pitfalls&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/know-thy-enemy-how-to-prioritize-and-communicate-risks-cre-life-lessons&#34;&gt;Know thy enemy: How to prioritize and communicate risks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/how-to-avoid-a-self-inflicted-ddos-attack-cre-life-lessons&#34;&gt;How to avoid a self-inflicted DDoS Attack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/using-load-shedding-to-survive-a-success-disaster-cre-life-lessons&#34;&gt;Using load shedding to survive a success disaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Service-level metrics&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/available-or-not-that-is-the-question-cre-life-lessons&#34;&gt;Available . . . or not?

      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configuration as Data is an emerging cloud infrastructure management paradigm that allows developers to &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/understanding-configuration-as-data-in-kubernetes&#34;&gt;declare the desired state&lt;/a&gt; of their applications and infrastructure, without specifying the precise actions or steps for how to achieve it. However, declaring a configuration is only half the battle: you also want policy that defines how a configuration is to be used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configuration as Data enables a normalized policy contract across all your cloud resources. That contract, knowing how your deployment will operate, can be inspected and enforced throughout a CI/CD pipeline, from upstream in your development environment to deployment time, and ongoing in the live runtime environment. This consistency is possible by expressing configuration as data throughout the development and operations lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Config Connector&lt;/a&gt; is the tool that allows you to express configuration as data in Google Cloud. In this model, configuration is what you want to deploy, such as “a storage bucket named &lt;code&gt;my-bucket&lt;/code&gt; with a standard storage class and uniform access control.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policy, meanwhile, typically specifies what you’re allowed to deploy, usually in conformance with your organization’s compliance needs. For example, “all resources must be deployed in Google Cloud’s &lt;code&gt;LONDON&lt;/code&gt; region.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When each stage in your pipeline treats configuration as data, you can use any tool or language to manipulate configuration as data, knowing they will interoperate and that policy can be consistently enforced at any or all stages. And while a policy engine won’t be able to understand every tool, it can validate the data generated by each tool. It’s just like data in a database can be inspected by anyone who knows the schema regardless of the tool that wrote into the database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast that with pipelines today, where policy is manually validated, hard coded in scripts within the pipeline logic itself, or post-processed on raw deployment artifacts after rendering configuration templates into specific instances. In each case, policy is siloed—you can’t take the same policy and apply it anywhere in your pipeline because formats differ from tool to tool. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Helm, for example, contains code &lt;a href=&#34;https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/control_structures/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;specific to its own format&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/syntax/configuration.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Terraform HCL&lt;/a&gt; may then deploy the Helm chart.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HCL becomes a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/json-format.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;JSON plan&lt;/a&gt;, where the deployment-ready configuration may be validated before being applied to the live environment.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;These examples show three disparate data formats across two different tools representing different portions of a desired end state. Add in Python scripting, gcloud CLI, or &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt; commands and you start approaching ten different formats—all for the same deployment!  Reliably enforcing a policy contract requires you to inject tool- and format-specific validation logic on case-by-case basis. If you decide to move a config step from Python to Terraform or from Terraform to &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;, you’ll need to re-evaluate your contract and probably re-implement some of that policy validation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why don’t these tools work together cleanly? Why does policy validation change depending on the development tools you’re using? Each tool can do a good job enforcing policy within itself. As long as you use that tool everywhere, things will probably work ok. But we all know that’s not how development works. People tend to choose tools that fit their needs and figure out integration later on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A Rosetta Stone for policy contracts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that everyone is defining their configuration as data, while using tools and formats of their choice. Terraform or Python for orchestration. Helm for application packaging. Java or Go for data transformation and validation. Once the data format is understood (because it is open source and extensible), your pipeline becomes a bus that anyone can push configuration onto and pull configuration from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/policy_contracts.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34; rel=&#34;external&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;policy contracts.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/policy_contracts.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Policies can be automatically validated at commit or build time using custom and &lt;a href=&#34;https://googlecontainertools.github.io/kpt/guides/consumer/function/catalog/validators/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;off-the-shelf functions&lt;/a&gt; that operate on YAML. You can manage commit and merge permissions separately for config and policy to separate these distinct concerns. You can have folders and unique permissions for org-wide policy, team-wide policy, or app-specific policy. Therein lies the dream. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most common way to generate configuration is to simply write a YAML file describing how Kubernetes should create a resource for you. The resulting YAML file is then stored in a git repository where it can be versioned and picked up by another tool and applied to a Kubernetes cluster. Policies can be enforced on the git repo side to limit who can push changes to the repository and ultimately reference them at deploy time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most users this is not where policy enforcement ends. While code reviews can catch a lot of things, it’s considered best practice to “trust but verify” at all layers in the stack. That’s where admission controllers come in, which can be considered to be the last mile of policy enforcement. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.openpolicyagent.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt; serves as an admission controller inside of a Kubernetes cluster. Only configurations that meet defined constraints will be admitted to the live cloud environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s tie these concepts together &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kelseyhightower/config-connector-policy-demo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;with an example&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine you want to enable users to create Cloud Storage buckets, but you don’t want them doing so using the Google Cloud Console or the gcloud command line tool. You want all users to declare what they want and push those changes to a git repository for review before the underlying Cloud Storage buckets are created with &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Config Connector&lt;/a&gt;. Essentially you want users to be able to submit a YAML file that looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a storage bucket in a default location. There is one problem with this: users can create buckets in any location even if company policy dictates otherwise. Sure, you can catch people using forbidden bucket locations during code review, but that’s prone to human error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where Gatekeeper comes in. You want the ability to limit which Cloud Storage bucket location can be used. Ideally you can write policies that look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The above &lt;code&gt;StorageBucketAllowedLocation&lt;/code&gt; policy rejects &lt;code&gt;StorageBucket&lt;/code&gt; objects with the &lt;code&gt;spec.location&lt;/code&gt; field set to any value other than one of the Cloud Storage multi-region locations: ASIA, EU, US. You decide where to validate policy without being limited by your tool of choice and anywhere in your pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you have the last stage of your configuration pipeline. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Testing the contract&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does this work in practice? Let’s say someone managed to check in &lt;code&gt;StorageBucket&lt;/code&gt; resource with the following config:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our policy would reject the bucket because an empty location is not allowed. What happens if configuration was set to a Cloud Storage location not allowed by the policy, &lt;code&gt;US-WEST1&lt;/code&gt; for example?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally you would catch this during the code review process before the config is committed to a git repo, but as mentioned above, that’s error prone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the configuration will fail because the &lt;code&gt;allowmultiregions&lt;/code&gt; policy constraint only allows multi-region bucket locations including ASIA, EU, and US, and will reject the configuration. So, now, if you set location to “US” you can deploy the Cloud Storage bucket. You can also apply this type of location policy or any other like it to all of your resource types—Redis instances, Compute Engine virtual machines, even Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. Beyond admission control, you can apply the same constraint anywhere in your pipeline, by ”shifting left” policy validation at any stage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;One contract to rule them all&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When config is managed in silos—whether across many tools, pipelines, graphical interfaces, and command lines—you can’t inject logic without building bespoke tools for every interface. You may be able to define policies built for your front-end tools and hope nothing changes on the backend. Or you can wait until deployment time to scan for deviations and hope nothing appears during crunch time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compare that with configuration as data contracts, which are transparent and normalized across resource types, which has facilitated a rich ecosystem of tooling built around Kubernetes with varied syntax (YAML, JSON) and languages including Ruby, Typescript, Go, Jinja, Mustache, Jsonnet, Starlark, and many others. This isn’t possible without a data model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Configuration-as-Data-inspired tools such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview&#34;&gt;Config Connector&lt;/a&gt; and Gatekeeper let you enforce policy and governance as natural parts of your existing git-based workflow rather than creating manual processes and approvals. Configuration as data normalizes your contract across resource types and even cloud providers. You don’t need to reverse engineer scripts and code paths to know if your contract is being met—just look at the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;1. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/jenkins/templates/jenkins-master-deployment.yaml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/jenkins/templates/jenkins-master-deployment.yaml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;2. &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/swlh/deploying-helm-charts-w-terraform-58bd3a690e55&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://medium.com/swlh/deploying-helm-charts-w-terraform-58bd3a690e55&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;3. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-getting-started-gcp-cloud-shell/blob/master/tutorial/cloudshell_tutorial.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-getting-started-gcp-cloud-shell/blob/master/tutorial/cloudshell_tutorial.md&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/containers-kubernetes/understanding-configuration-as-data-in-kubernetes/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Blog_header_opensource_2.max-500x500.jpg&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;I do declare!

It’s just like data in a database can be inspected by anyone who knows the schema regardless of the tool that wrote into the database.</p><p>Contrast that with pipelines today, where policy is manually validated, hard coded in scripts within the pipeline logic itself, or post-processed on raw deployment artifacts after rendering configuration templates into specific instances. In each case, policy is siloed—you can’t take the same policy and apply it anywhere in your pipeline because formats differ from tool to tool. </p><p>Helm, for example, contains code <a href="https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/control_structures/" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="3" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://helm.sh" track-metadata-module="post">specific to its own format</a>.<sup>1</sup></p></div></paragraph-block></div><div><article-code-block _nghost-c20=""><pre _ngcontent-c20="">  <code _ngcontent-c20="">{{- if .Values.master.usePodSecurityContext }}

But not everyone knows the best places to start to implement SRE in their own organizations. Here are our top resources at Google Cloud for getting started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Do you have an SRE team yet? How to start and assess your journey&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re often asked what implementing SRE means in practice, since our customers face challenges quantifying their success when setting up their own SRE practices. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/how-to-start-and-assess-your-sre-journey&#34;&gt;In this post&lt;/a&gt;, we share a couple of checklists to be used by members of an organization responsible for any high-reliability services. These will be useful when you’re trying to move your team toward an SRE model. Implementing this model at your organization can benefit both your services and teams due to higher service reliability, lower operational cost, and higher-value work for everyone on the team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/devops-sre/how-to-start-and-assess-your-sre-journey/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/DevOps_BlogHeader_D_Rnd3.max-500x500.jpg&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;Do you have an SRE team yet?

SRE fundamentals: SLIs, SLAs and SLOs&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Core to the definition of SRE is the idea that metrics should be closely tied to business objectives. Thus, a big part of the day-to-day of SREs is establishing and monitoring these service-level metrics. At Google, we use several essential measurements—SLO, SLA and SLI—in SRE planning and practice. &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos&#34;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; gives you an overview of what each of these acronyms are, what they mean, and how to incorporate them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-related_article_tout&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;section class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker&#34; data-analytics=&#39;{&#xA;                       &#34;event&#34;: &#34;page interaction&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;category&#34;: &#34;article lead&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;action&#34;: &#34;related article - inline&#34;,&#xA;                       &#34;label&#34;: &#34;article: {slug}&#34;&#xA;                     }&#39; href=&#34;https://gweb-cloudblog-publish.appspot.com/products/devops-sre/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos/&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow&#34;&gt;Related Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(&#39;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Google_Cloud-01_xyGPYQS.max-500x500.png&#39;)&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__content&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin&#34;&gt;SRE fundamentals: SLIs, SLAs and SLOs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p class=&#34;uni-related-article-tout__body&#34;&gt;A big part of SRE is establishing and monitoring service-level metrics like SLOs, SLAs and SLIs.

These will be useful when you’re trying to move your team toward an SRE model. Implementing this model at your organization can benefit both your services and teams due to higher service reliability, lower operational cost, and higher-value work for everyone on the team.</p></div></paragraph-block></div><div><paragraph-block _nghost-c19=""><div _ngcontent-c19="" innerhtml="&lt;h3&gt;2.

We&#39;ve experienced firsthand how empowering it can be to shape the future of an organization, help one another grow, as well as unlock the business opportunities that a transformation provides. Our own personal experiences, and those of our peers, have led us to conclude one thing we know to be true for every company - the story of digital transformation is a human story—one that involves as much cultural transformation as technological transformation. It’s with this realization we have identified the deeper factors behind a successful transformation. That&#39;s why we recently published a guide, reflecting on the nature of these changes and how you can take action in your own organization to drive a migration to the cloud. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Posing challenging questions helps you reflect on your own organization’s journey and the unique path you will need to take to lead to meaningful change. We wrote this guide to share key tenets that underpin the change philosophy you need to instill in your own organization. In &lt;a href=&#34;https://googlesre.page.link/cloud-migration-guide&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;A Practical Guide to Moving to Cloud&lt;/a&gt;, we present the following calls to action:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand who in the organization you need to enlist to move to cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a psychologically safe culture in which you can grow together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Define clear objectives for your organization.

      <title>With SRE, failing to plan is planning to fail</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-success-starts-with-getting-leadership-on-board/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;People sometimes think that implementing &lt;a href=&#34;http://sre.google&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Site Reliability Engineering&lt;/a&gt; (or DevOps for that matter) will magically make everything better. Just sprinkle a little bit of SRE fairy dust on your organization and your services will be more reliable, more profitable, and your IT, product and engineering teams will be happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to see why people think this way. Some of the world’s most reliable and scalable services run with the help of an SRE team, Google being the prime example. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For almost two decades, I’ve lived and breathed running production systems at large scale. I had to think about tradeoffs, reliability, costs, implementing a variety of architectures with different constraints and requirements—all while getting paged in the middle of the night. More recently, I’ve had the privilege to leverage that experience and knowledge to help Google Cloud customers modernize their infrastructure and applications, including implementing an SRE practice. While these learnings look different from organization to organization, there are common lessons learned that will impact the success of your deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When problems do arise, it’s usually not because of technical challenges. A stalled SRE culture is usually a business process failure—goals weren’t properly defined up front and stakeholders weren’t properly engaged. After watching this play out repeatedly, I’ve developed some advice for technology leaders about how to implement a successful SRE practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Before you start&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your SRE journey should start well before you read your first manual, or put in your first call to an SRE advisor. As a technology leader within your organization, your first job is to answer a few key questions and gather some basic facts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What problem are you trying to solve? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most organizations will readily admit they’re not perfect. Perhaps you need to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvQ-15-yE_c&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;reduce toil&lt;/a&gt;, be more innovative, or release software faster. SRE, as a framework for operating large scale systems reliably, can certainly help with those goals. To do that, it’s important to understand your motivations and what gaps or needs exist in your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself what the organization is trying to achieve from the transformation. What worries the organization about reliability? For SRE to be successful and efficient, it is crucial to &lt;b&gt;start with the pain&lt;/b&gt;. Starting by identifying what you are trying to solve will not just help you solve it; it will help your organization be more focused, align the relevant parties to a common goal, and make it easier to gain decision-makers’ buy-in (and much more).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you understand the problem you are trying to solve, you need to know when you have “solved” it (e.g. how you will define success). Setting goals is critical—otherwise, how will you know if you have improved? We’ll discuss how to set up metrics to help in this self-evaluation in a later post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who are the key decision-makers in the organization?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though implementing SRE principles involves engineering at its core, it’s actually more of a transformation process than a technological challenge. As such, it will likely require procedural and cultural changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with any business transformation, you need to identify the relevant decision-makers up front. Who those people are depends on the organization, but it usually includes stakeholders from product, operations, and engineering leadership, though these can be named differently in various organizations and can even be separated under multiple organizations. Identifying those decision makers can be especially difficult in a siloed organization. It is important to take the time and reach out to different groups to identify the key stakeholders and influencers (it will save you a lot of time later on). Make sure that you are throwing a wide enough net. It is important to get input from different groups with different requirements (e.g., security).  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, try to be &lt;b&gt;flexible&lt;/b&gt;. It’s okay if your list of decision makers gets updated and fine-tuned during the process. Like in other engineering domains, the goal is to start simple and iterate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Get buy-in and build trust&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve identified the relevant decision makers, make sure you have support from your colleagues, and the rest of the organization’s leaders. &lt;b&gt;Creating an empowered culture&lt;/b&gt; is critical for implementing the core principles of SRE: a &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-learning-culture&#34;&gt;learning culture&lt;/a&gt; that accepts failures, that facilitates blamelessness and creates psychological safety, all while prioritizing gradual changes and automation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From my experience, you cannot drive real change in an organization without widespread support and buy-in from leadership and decision-makers—and that’s especially true for SRE.  Implementing SRE, similar to DevOps, requires collaboration between different functions in the organization (product, operations and development). In most organizations, those functions fall under separate leadership chains, each with its own processes. If you’re going to align those goals and procedures, leadership needs to prioritize the change. At the same time, driving cultural change from the bottom up can be more challenging and take longer than top-down mandates, and in some cultures will be impossible. In short, leading by example and enabling the people in the organization are critical for driving change and fostering the &#39;right&#39; culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Remember: it&#39;s a marathon, not a sprint &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey to SRE combines several challenges, both from technical and human (culture, process, extra) perspectives, and those are intertwined. To be successful, leadership needs to prioritize organizational changes, allocating resources for &lt;b&gt;engineering excellence&lt;/b&gt; (quality and reliability) and &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/solutions/devops/devops-culture-westrum-organizational-culture#how_to_implement_organizational_culture&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;fostering cultural principles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; like reducing silos, blamelessness and accepting failure as normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Align expectations! All parties involved in an SRE implementation—from product and engineering to leadership—will need to recognize that change takes time and effort, and in the short term—resources. Daunting as it may be, SRE’s goal is to solve hard problems and build for a better tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Interested in getting deeper with SRE principles?

      <title>Troubleshooting services on Google Kubernetes Engine by example</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/operations/troubleshooting-services-on-google-kubernetes-engine/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applications fail. Containers crash. It’s a fact of life that SRE and DevOps teams know all too well. To help navigate life’s hiccups, we’ve previously shared &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/tools-for-debugging-apps-on-google-kubernetes-engine&#34;&gt;how to debug applications running on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve also updated the GKE &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/solutions/gke/observing&#34;&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; with new easier-to-use troubleshooting flows. Today, we go one step further and show you how you can use these flows to quickly find and resolve issues in your applications and infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we&#39;ll walk through deploying a sample app to your cluster and configuring an alerting policy that will notify you if there are any container restarts observed. From there, we&#39;ll trigger the alert and explore how the new GKE dashboard makes it easy to identify the issue and determine exactly what&#39;s going on with your workload or infrastructure that may be causing it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Setting up&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deploy the app&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This example uses a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yuriatgoogle/stack-doctor/blob/master/crashing-pod-demo/main.go&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;demo app&lt;/a&gt; that exposes two endpoints: an endpoint at /, which is just a &#34;hello world&#34;, and a /crashme endpoint, which uses Go&#39;s &lt;code&gt;os.Exit(1)&lt;/code&gt; to terminate the process. To deploy the app in your own cluster, create a container image using Cloud Build and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yuriatgoogle/stack-doctor/blob/master/crashing-pod-demo/deployment.yaml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;deploy&lt;/a&gt; it to GKE. Then, expose the service with a load balancer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the service is deployed, check the running pods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that RESTARTS is initially at zero for each pod. Use a browser or a command line tool like curl to access the /crashme endpoint. At this point, you should see a restart:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each request to that endpoint will result in a restart. However, be careful to not do this more often than every 30 seconds or so, otherwise, the containers will go into CrashLoopBackOff, and it will take time for the service to be available again. You can use this simple shell script to trigger restarts when as needed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-code&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3&#34;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;where $IP_ADDRESS is the IP address of the load balancer you&#39;ve already created. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do container restarts matter? Well, restarts, to a certain degree, are an expected part of a container’s typical lifecycle in Kubernetes. Too many container restarts, however, could affect the availability of your service, especially when expanded over a larger number of replicas for a given Pod. Not only do excessive restarts degrade the service in question, but they also risks affecting other services downstream that use it as a dependency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In real life,the culprit for a large number of restarts could be a poorly designed liveness probe, issues like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;deadlocks&lt;/a&gt; in the application itself, or misconfigured memory requests that result in &lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;OOMkilled&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; errors. So, it is important for you to proactively alert on container restarts to preempt potential degradation that can cascade across multiple services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Configure the alert&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Now, you&#39;re ready to configure the alert that will notify you when restarts are detected. Here&#39;s how to set up your &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerts&#34;&gt;alerting policy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;1 Configure the alert.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/1_Configure_the_alert.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;code&gt;kubernetes.io/container/restart_count&lt;/code&gt; metric, filtered to the specific container name (as specified in the deployment yaml &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yuriatgoogle/stack-doctor/blob/master/crashing-pod-demo/deployment.yaml&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;file&lt;/a&gt;). Configure the alert to trigger if any timeseries exceeded zero—meaning if any container restarts are observed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the setup done, you are ready to test and see what happens!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Testing the alert&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready, start the looped script to hit the /crashme endpoint every 45 seconds. The restart_count metric is sampled every 60 seconds, so it shouldn&#39;t take very long for an alert to show up on the dashboard:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;2 Testing the alert.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/2_Testing_the_alert.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can mouse-over the incident to get more information about it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;3 incident.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/3_incident.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then click on &#34;View Incident&#34;. This takes you to the Incident details screen, where you can see the specific resources that triggered it—in this case, the incident is generated by the container.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;4 View Incident.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/4_View_Incident.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, you can click on View Logs to see the logs (in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/view/logs-viewer-preview&#34;&gt;new Logs Viewer&lt;/a&gt;!)—it&#39;s immediately apparently that the alert is triggered by the containers restarting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;5 View Logs.jpg&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/5_View_Logs.max-1000x1000.jpg&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all very nicely tied together and makes troubleshooting during an incident much easier!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;In summary….&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest GKE dashboard includes many improvements over previous iterations. The new alerts timeline is intuitive, and incidents are clearly marked so that you can interact with them to get the full details of exactly what happened, all the way down to the container logs that tell you the actual problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an oncall SRE or DevOps engineer for a service running on GKE, the GKE dashboard makes it easier for you to respond to incidents. You&#39;re now able to go from an incident all the way to debug logs quickly and easily and reduce the time it takes to triage and mitigate incidents.

Not only do excessive restarts degrade the service in question, but they also risks affecting other services downstream that use it as a dependency.</p><p>In real life,the culprit for a large number of restarts could be a poorly designed liveness probe, issues like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="5" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://en.wikipedia.org" track-metadata-module="post">deadlocks</a> in the application itself, or misconfigured memory requests that result in <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/" target="_blank" track-type="inline link" track-name="6" track-metadata-eventdetail="https://kubernetes.io" track-metadata-module="post"><code>OOMkilled</code></a> errors. So, it is important for you to proactively alert on container restarts to preempt potential degradation that can cascade across multiple services. </p><p><b>Configure the alert<br/></b>Now, you&#39;re ready to configure the alert that will notify you when restarts are detected.

      <title>Show me the money! How you can see returns up to $259M with a DevOps transformation</title>

      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;2020 challenged some of the best laid plans by enterprises. With nearly everything moving online, Covid-19 pushed forward years of digital transformation. DevOps was at the heart of this transformation journey. After all, delivering software quickly, reliably, and safely to meet the changing needs of customers was crucial to adapt to this new normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unlikely that the pace of modernization will slow down in 2021. As IT and business leaders further drive digital adoption within their organizations via DevOps, the need to quantify the business benefit from a digital transformation remains top of mind. A reliable model is imperative to drive the right level of investments and measure the returns. This is precisely why we wrote &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/resources/roi-of-devops-transformation-whitepaper&#34;&gt;How to Measure ROI of DevOps Transformation&lt;/a&gt;. This white paper is backed with scientific studies conducted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devops-research.com/research.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DevOps Research and Assessment, DORA&lt;/a&gt;, with 31,000 professionals worldwide over 6 years to provide clear guidance based on impartial industry data. We found the financial savings of DevOps transformation varies from from $10M to $259M a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Looking beyond cost to value&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most innovative companies undertake their technology transformations with a focus on the value they can deliver to their customers. Hence, in addition to measuring cost savings, we show how DevOps done right can be a value driver and innovation engine. Let&#39;s look deeper into how we quantify the cost and value-generating power of DevOps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Cost-driven category&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we focus on quantifying the cost savings and efficiencies realized by implementing DevOps—for example, how an investment in DevOps reduces costs by cutting the time it takes to resolve outages and avoiding downtime as much as possible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, focusing solely on reducing costs can rarely yield systemic, long-term gains; thereby increasing the importance of going beyond cost-driven strategies. The cost savings achieved in year one “no longer count” beyond year two as the organization adjusts to a new baseline of costs and performance. Worse, only focusing on cost savings signals to technical staff their job is potentially at risk due to automation rather than being liberated from drudge work to better drive business growth. This leads to negative effects on morale and productivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Value-driven category&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two value drivers in a DevOps transformation, (1) improved efficiency through the reduction of unnecessary rework, and (2) the potential revenue gained by reinvesting the time saved in new offer capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding these cost and value driven categories together, IT and business decision makers can get an estimate of the potential value their organizations can expect to gain from a DevOps transformation. This helps justify the investment needed to implement the required changes. To quantify the impact, we leverage industry benchmark data across low, medium, high, and elite DevOps teams, as described by DORA in its annual &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops&#34;&gt;Accelerate: State of DevOps report&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Combining cost and value&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, let&#39;s consider the impact of a DevOps transformation on a large organization with 8,500 technical staff and a medium IT performer. Using the data gained from the DevOps report, we can calculate both the cost and value driven categories along with total impact. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;roi table&#34; src=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-25_at_6.08.51_PM.max-1000x1000.png&#34;/&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this example represents what a medium IT performer at a large organization might expect by investing in DevOps, companies of all sizes and performance profiles can leverage DevOps to drive performance. In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/resources/roi-of-devops-transformation-whitepaper&#34;&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt;, we calculate the impact of DevOps across organizations of different sizes—small, medium, and large—as well as across four distinct performance profiles—low, medium, high, elite. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be variation in these measurements based on your team’s current performance, compensation, change fail rate, benefits multiplier, and deployments per year, so we share our methodology in the white paper and invite you to customize the approach based on your specific needs and constraints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-video&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module article-video &#34;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;h-c-video h-c-video--marquee&#34; data-glue-modal-disabled-on-mobile=&#34;true&#34; data-glue-modal-trigger=&#34;uni-modal-gZ7GtQ8XzYo-&#34; href=&#34;https://youtube.com/watch?v=gZ7GtQ8XzYo&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-video__aspect-image&#34; style=&#34;background-image: url(https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Screen_Shot_2021-01-12_at_2.49.11_PM.max-1000x1000.png);&#34;&gt;&lt;span class=&#34;h-u-visually-hidden&#34;&gt;ROI of DevOps Transformation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;svg class=&#34;h-c-video__play h-c-icon h-c-icon--color-white&#34; role=&#34;img&#34;&gt;&lt;use xlink:href=&#34;#mi-youtube-icon&#34;&gt;&lt;/use&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class=&#34;article-video__caption h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;h4 class=&#34;h-c-headline h-c-headline--four h-u-font-weight-medium h-u-mt-std&#34;&gt;ROI of DevOps Transformation: How to quantify the impact of your modernization initiatives&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-modal--video&#34; data-glue-modal=&#34;uni-modal-gZ7GtQ8XzYo-&#34; data-glue-modal-close-label=&#34;Close Dialog&#34;&gt;&lt;a class=&#34;glue-yt-video&#34; data-glue-yt-video-autoplay=&#34;true&#34; data-glue-yt-video-height=&#34;99%&#34; data-glue-yt-video-vid=&#34;gZ7GtQ8XzYo&#34; data-glue-yt-video-width=&#34;100%&#34; href=&#34;https://youtube.com/watch?v=gZ7GtQ8XzYo&#34; ng-cloak=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.devops-research.com/research.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DORA research&lt;/a&gt; show that undertaking a technology transformation initiative can produce sizable returns for any organization.

      <title>Take the first step toward SRE with Cloud Operations Sandbox</title>
      <link>https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/operations/on-the-road-to-sre-with-cloud-operations-sandbox/</link>
      <description>&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-paragraph&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;rich-text&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Google Cloud, we strive to bring Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) culture to our customers not only through training on organizational best practices, but also with the tools you need to run successful cloud services. Part and parcel of that is comprehensive observability tooling—logging, monitoring, tracing, profiling and debugging—which can help you troubleshoot production issues faster, increase release velocity and improve service reliability. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We often hear that implementing observability is hard, especially for complex distributed applications that are implemented in different programming languages, deployed in a variety of environments, that have different operational costs, and many other factors. As a result, when migrating and modernizing workloads onto Google Cloud, observability is often an afterthought. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, being able to debug the system and gain insights into the system’s behavior is important for running reliable production systems. Customers want to learn how to instrument services for observability and implement SRE best practices using tools Google Cloud has to offer, but without risking production environments. With &lt;a href=&#34;http://cloud-ops-sandbox.dev&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Cloud Operations Sandbox&lt;/a&gt;, you can learn in practice how to kickstart your observability journey and answer the question, “Will it work for my use-case?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Operations Sandbox is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-ops-sandbox&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;open-source tool&lt;/a&gt; that helps you learn SRE practices from Google and apply them on cloud services using &lt;a href=&#34;https://cloud.google.com/products/operations&#34;&gt;Google Cloud’s operations suite&lt;/a&gt; (formerly Stackdriver). Cloud Operations Sandbox has everything you need to get started in one click:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Demo service&lt;/b&gt; - an application built using microservices architecture on modern, cloud-native stack (a modified fork of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Online Boutique microservices&lt;/a&gt; demo app)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One-click deployment&lt;/b&gt; - automated script that deploys and configures the service to Google Cloud, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Service Monitoring configuration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing with OpenTelemetry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud Profiling, Logging, Error Reporting, Debugging and more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Load generator&lt;/b&gt; - a component that produces synthetic traffic on the demo service&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SRE recipes&lt;/b&gt; - pre-built tasks that manufacture intentional errors in the demo app so you can use Cloud Operations tools to find the root cause of problems like you would in production&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;b&gt;interactive walkthrough&lt;/b&gt; to get started with Cloud Operations &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launching the Cloud Operations Sandbox is as easy as can be. Simply:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go to &lt;a href=&#34;http://cloud-ops-sandbox.dev&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;cloud-ops-sandbox.dev&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on the “Open in Google Cloud Shell” button. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This creates a new Google Cloud project. Within that project, a Terraform script creates a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster and deploys a sample application to it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-ops-sandbox/tree/master/src&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The microservices that make up the demo app&lt;/a&gt; are pre-instrumented with logging, monitoring, tracing, debugging and profiling as appropriate for each microservices language runtime. As such, sending traffic to the demo app generates telemetry that can be useful for diagnosing the cloud service’s operation. In order to generate production-like traffic to the demo app, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-ops-sandbox/tree/master/src/loadgenerator&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;an automated script&lt;/a&gt; deploys a synthetic load generator in a different geo-location than the demo app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;block-image_full_width&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;article-module h-c-page&#34;&gt;&lt;div class=&#34;h-c-grid&#34;&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 &#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Terraform_script_creates_a_GKE_cluste.max-2800x2800.jpg&#34;
