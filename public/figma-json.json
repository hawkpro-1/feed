      "content_html": "\u003cdiv id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe magic of Figma products is that real-time collaboration across teammates and locations feels effortless. From a product perspective, this means that the data we fetch and display to the user needs to be real-time, too. For example, if a user is looking at files for their latest project and a coworker adds a new file to the project, the new file needs to show up for them right away, without needing to refresh the page.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the infrastructure team, the question was: how do we empower our product engineers to build these real-time views easily, while abstracting away the complexity of pushing data back and forth?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo provide a general solution to this fundamental business need, we developed LiveGraph, a data fetching layer on top of Postgres that allows our frontend code to request real-time data subscriptions expressed with GraphQL. It issues queries directly to the database and provides live updates in the order of milliseconds by reading the database replication stream.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"challenges-in-real-time\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#challenges-in-real-time\"\u003eChallenges, in real-time\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince 2016, Figma has used React for the frontend, which fetches data from Ruby HTTP endpoints. At first, each page load would fetch all the data it needed in a single large request, then put it in global state using Redux. To provide real-time updates, product engineers would manually craft event messages to be sent to the relevant clients everywhere we write to the database in our backend code. Then, the frontend would need to subscribe to these event messages using a WebSocket connection and apply the update to the global state.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a long time, this approach served us well and allowed us to move fast and develop new product features quickly. However, as each user\u0026#39;s usage of Figma grew, so did the amount of data each client was requesting on page load. Naturally, we started splitting up the request and loading data incrementally. But, this adds complexity, and we couldn’t guarantee that all data would be available in-memory at all times. When multiple product areas needed the same data, it created confusion regarding who is responsible for fetching the data and when the data is guaranteed to be available.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the usage growth, new product features further increased the complexity of maintaining client state using ad hoc notifications. While certain types of events are quite straightforward (e.g. “a new file was created”), others could be much more complicated. For example, a change in the value of a resource affecting permissions could have a large downstream effect in the visibility of other resources. It also wasn’t possible to guarantee that real-time messages would be sent or received in the same order as the corresponding write to the database. Overall, working with them became hard to reason about and caused a lot of data consistency bugs in which the client state no longer reflected the subset of server state it was supposed to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"in-house-vs-out-of-the-box\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#in-house-vs-out-of-the-box\"\u003eIn-house vs. out-of-the-box\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe realized that we needed a more general framework that would allow product developers to declaratively define data subscriptions. A natural choice for this interface was to use GraphQL, which would allow the system to automatically fetch and keep the data live-updated. We decided to build it in-house and call it LiveGraph.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are many systems that offer similar functionality. For example, even within Figma, we have a service called multiplayer (which we wrote about \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e) that powers real-time collaboration. However, multiplayer solves a very different set of problems, supporting writes and conflict resolution, but only at the level of individual Figma files.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince Figma already operates at scale using Postgres, LiveGraph needed to be a data-fetching layer built on top of our existing infrastructure. In other words, it had to be a query engine, not a persistence layer. As a result, we couldn’t migrate to real-time databases such as Firebase or RethinkDB just for the sake of better live data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext, we took a look at the GraphQL ecosystem, since that was the interface that we wanted to expose. Many GraphQL-related technologies have features tied to data subscriptions. Note that the terminology in the industry around real-time data subscriptions can be confusing: GraphQL has a concept of subscriptions, but is used to subscribe to event streams, more akin to our old system with hand-crafted events. Instead, we wanted what is sometimes referred to as “Live Queries” in GraphQL-world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the key motivation for LiveGraph wasn’t to migrate Figma to using GraphQL, but to provide a robust and highly scalable system for live data. Technologies like Hasura, Prisma, and PostGraphile all offer subscription capabilities, but not with subscription scalability built as a primary use case. In some cases, they explicitly advise against large volumes of concurrent subscriptions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, we wanted to avoid polling-based solutions to providing live data, which multiply the load on the database beyond what we were comfortable with. It also forces application developers to decide on the polling frequency on a per-query level. A key LiveGraph design decision is to tail the database replication log, which also provides faster update latency than polling. Since this means that LiveGraph will need to read the full volume of database updates, it\u0026#39;s also important that our solution has a path towards distributing updates from multiple database shards across multiple machines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, we decided to invest in LiveGraph as an in-house solution. Due to Figma\u0026#39;s collaborative nature, LiveGraph is core to our business and a potential competitive advantage. Our claim is not that LiveGraph is strictly better than alternatives, but instead that our needs are specific enough that the investment made sense to us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2

LiveGraph provides an API that receives GraphQL-like queries and sends back the result as a JSON tree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike other GraphQL backends, we have a schema that describes the server-side entities/relations that make up our object graph, and views that allow querying a subset of that

support this, LiveGraph consists of both a server and a client-side library. The \u003ccode\u003euseSubscription\u003c/code\u003e hook is part of the client-side library, which will send a request to the server. The client will then receive a response as a series of JSON messages that the library uses to reconstruct the result and its follow-up updates. This result object is statically-typed, as LiveGraph is capable of generating TypeScript bindings for the GraphQL API. It will then be passed as props to further React components for rendering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe key is that this React component will always render the latest data from the server without any additional work. No more custom event streams per feature! Under the hood, the client library receives incremental updates to the result and constructs a new tree made of in-memory references. The \u003ccode\u003euseSubscription\u003c/code\u003e hook then triggers a re-render of the component. In other words, the usage of the hook alone makes the component real-time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition, the interface provides consistency guarantees on notification delivery. Updates are guaranteed to be received in order and exactly once. If the client ever disconnects, the library will reconnect under the hood and refetch the data for the view.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiveGraph also offers the ability to define access control rules on objects, and on relations between objects. This way, the server will not send the client any instances of data that fail the permission checks. Furthermore, these permission checks can themselves be dependent upon data loaded from subscribed subviews, allowing the permissions to be updated in real-time, as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, the LiveGraph frontend library also includes APIs for optimistic updates. This allows updating the front-end state with a user edit before the server write goes through, eliminating latency in the user experience. By integrating this feature within LiveGraph, we can detect when the subscription updates with the result of the write and automatically remove the now-redundant optimistic update.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"livegraph-on-the-backend\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#livegraph-on-the-backend\"\u003eLiveGraph on the backend\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy abstracting the complexity of real-time updates away from the client, the challenge is now on the backend: understanding how to efficiently route changes from the database to the appropriate clients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the key requirements when designing LiveGraph was to make sure that the migration of product features to LiveGraph does not cause drastic load increases on the database. While real-time updates are top of mind, guaranteeing high website availability is even more important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithout this constraint, we might use polling as a simple architecture for providing real-time data—at regular intervals, we could refetch the entire view. However, this would multiply the amount of queries issued to the database by a large factor. Instead, we subscribe to the database replication stream (write-ahead log), which is distributed across servers via Kafka.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/59ba0b1d42890ecc0fbb9b674e534fde15e16255-1600x1024.png?rect=0,0,1599,1024\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=429\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/59ba0b1d42890ecc0fbb9b674e534fde15e16255-1600x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/59ba0b1d42890ecc0fbb9b674e534fde15e16255-1600x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/59ba0b1d42890ecc0fbb9b674e534fde15e16255-1600x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/59ba0b1d42890ecc0fbb9b674e534fde15e16255-1600x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/59ba0b1d42890ecc0fbb9b674e534fde15e16255-1600x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe bookkeeping for each view subscription is handled by decomposing the view into a tree of more granular subqueries. A view fetches many types of data, but a subquery fetches a single type of object. Translated into SQL, these subqueries take the form \u003ccode\u003eSELECT columns FROM table WHERE condition\u003c/code\u003e without any joins. The conditions represent the relation between objects which was defined in the schema. LiveGraph maintains an in-memory tree representation of the view (the live view tree) where each node in the tree is a subquery.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith this decomposition, we can subscribe each subquery separately. Using the filter condition of each subquery, we maintain an index of all active subqueries for each type of object. This way, we can efficiently route each new entry in the replication stream to update the cached result of the appropriate subqueries. In turn, this updates the corresponding live view tree(s).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne benefit of this decomposition is that we can deduplicate a lot of work by sharing subqueries between live view trees, effectively creating a caching layer. For example, in a large organization, you could have thousands of users loading the file browser, all of which will contain the subquery \u003ccode\u003eSELECT id, name FROM teams WHERE org_id = x\u003c/code\u003e which fetches the data needed to populate the list of teams in the sidebar. Since subscribing to a query implies that we keep the result set in memory after the initial request to the database, subsequent subscriptions to the same query will reuse the latest result set, all within LiveGraph.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiveGraph is implemented using a combination of both NodeJS and Go. The JavaScript part exists to share code with the client. The naive way to send updates to the client would be to send a JSON serialization of the entire view result every time it updates, but that would be inefficient. So, the client is actually isomorphic with the server—it uses the same live view tree bookkeeping code to maintain its subscription. However, for the areas in the backend that are lower-level and more performance-intensive, we use Go for its multithreading capabilities and (generally) faster performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"present-and-future-work\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#present-and-future-work\"\u003ePresent and future work\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn order for LiveGraph to be a dependable service in a high-traffic production environment, we need to solve many challenges. The most obvious one is that LiveGraph needs to be designed to scale, as Figma scales. This means that it needs to support a sharded database. Currently, each instance can process the entire database replication stream to provide updates, which is on the order of 10,000 writes/second. In a sharded world, the updates come from multiple database streams, which affects consistency guarantees. Eventually, the write load will also exceed what a single LiveGraph instance can handle, meaning that LiveGraph itself will need to be sharded, such that each shard only reads a subset of the streams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScaling horizontally will also allow LiveGraph to spread out the CPU and memory load of supporting subscriptions. However, even then, we must be careful about spikes in load, both on individual instances (e.g. large views) and across the fleet. A particular aspect of scaling that creeps up in production is thundering herd. Since the client maintains persistent WebSocket connections with the server, mass reconnections after a deploy cause a large number of views to be re-subscribed at once. As such, it\u0026#39;s insufficient to look at steady-state load—specific events such as deploys can cause service degradation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to scaling challenges, LiveGraph is more than just a service—it’s a change in how we fetch data at Figma. It is not solely an infrastructure effort, but an engineering-wide adoption workstream. On the product side, we are:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdopting LiveGraph throughout the codebase while working to ensure we introduce no regressions in the process. We already power key products such as the mobile apps, comments, and the prototyping and editor views, and hope to extend this to any feature that benefits from real-time updates.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWorking with product teams to support or refactor existing product use cases that are non-trivial to directly translate into GraphQL.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreating tools and workflows so that it’s easy to evolve and version our schema.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIdentifying the best React architecture and best practices when using data from view subscriptions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImplementing pagination, a challenging problem in the face of real-time update, to support unbounded views.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of these problems are similar to those that organizations encounter while migrating from REST to GraphQL, but the subscription aspect always adds a unique flavor to each of these challenges. By solving them, we\u0026#39;re facilitating the development of real-time features that define what makes Figma so unique.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, this work is happening inside of a fast-growing startup! Every week, we encounter new scaling challenges. We are constantly learning about more product needs as our usage grows and product expands. It would be difficult to point to a precise milestone or moment in time where we would consider LiveGraph to be “done.” This is a natural consequence of designing a system to solve real problems for real users, and it’s exactly what makes the work fun.

Today, branching is broadly available on the Figma Organization plan. We have put together a \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/when-to-consider/\"\u003ebest practices guide\u003c/a\u003e to help you learn more about how and when to use branching, but we also wanted to share a bit about why we built it and how it came together in Figma.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"cd1b3104c463\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe built Figma to be multiplayer and, in most cases, real-time collaboration is an advantage. You don’t have to wonder if you’re working on the right file, because everyone’s working in the same file. But, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/design-process/\"\u003edesign process\u003c/a\u003e can get messy. And at scale, even messier. “Unapproved” changes find their way into code, work gets overwritten, and teams have a hard time telling the difference between WIP and production-ready designs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s why we’re excited to launch branching out of beta. Branches are exploratory spaces that enable designers to try new ideas without changing the main file until they’re ready and approved. They are especially useful for preserving the integrity of approved designs, while making room for work that’s experimental or iterative in nature, like contributing to a design library and previewing work for stakeholders. Now, when the time calls for a more structured approach to your designs, you can better manage your main files as a single source of truth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"balancing-freedom-and-structure-at-scale\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#balancing-freedom-and-structure-at-scale\"\u003eBalancing freedom and structure at scale\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Figma, we pay very close attention to user feedback. And, as design teams have grown over the years, we noticed more and more teams asking for better version control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea of branches comes from the world of software development, in which changes to files are local (i.e. stored on the machine you’re working on). Figma, on the other hand, is online, meaning that changes to files are in the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo when we were considering building branching, we asked ourselves questions like: How exactly should it work in Figma? Should we still allow multiple people simultaneously in the main file, and what about a branch? We also wondered whether it was possible to do this in a way that doesn’t add too much complexity for designers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"leaning-into-first-principles\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#leaning-into-first-principles\"\u003eLeaning into first principles\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe decided to take a different approach than previous tools, one purpose-built to complement multiplayer collaboration in the cloud. We leaned into simplicity and consistency as first principles, with the goal of giving teams one way of thinking about versioning that’s inclusive of both branching and multiplayer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is why the main file is still multiplayer, and branches work the same way as a regular Figma file. Access control and permissions for editors and viewers haven’t changed. We prioritized the sanctity of user data so your changes are safe no matter what happens, and intentionally kept the bells and whistles to a minimum (no branching from a branch).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeeping it simple, however, didn’t mean it was an easy task. Take the case of merging, for example. You might think that the hardest part would be dealing with merge conflicts—which \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e hard. But there were lots of other unexpected \u0026#34;gotchas,\u0026#34; like when you’re in the middle of reviewing a merge and the file changes from under you. Or, when you’re halfway through a merge and you lose your connection. How could we make sure you\u0026#39;re never in a bad state?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are just a few of the things we had to solve for that were unique to building branching into a multiplayer environment. And, in the end, we’re really happy with the way it turned out, and the decisions we made.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, we’re excited to open up this new workflow to everyone on a Figma Organization plan.

We have mastered the basics of muting and unmuting, and learned how to stay productive in unlikely places. But for all our progress, connecting with teammates and riffing on ideas doesn’t always feel as inspiring as it once was. So a few months ago, our product and design teams got together to brainstorm: how we can bring some of the magic from a really great jam session back into our digital work lives?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, the ideas they dreamed up are ready for prime time.

That same belief drives the team at \u003ca href=\"https://www.elsewhen.com/\"\u003eElsewhen\u003c/a\u003e, a digital product consultancy based in the UK that focuses on building B2B and enterprise tools for companies across industries and around the world. Elsewhen helps their clients identify broken systems and improve day-to-day operations with better tools. Empowered with the systems they need to focus on their work, their clients’ teams are able to build better products, solve harder problems, explore more freely, and ultimately build stronger organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause building tools requires close partnership with their clients, Elsewhen uses Figma as a collaborative home base to work and design together. “With Figma, we\u0026#39;ve been able to remove loads of routine steps, such as exporting, uploading, and distributing assets,” says Tadhg McCarthy, Founder and Design Director at Elsewhen. “Figma is not just a tool for designing final product screens; we use it across the entire process from exploration and workshopping, to prototyping with our clients.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLearn more about how Elsewhen uses Figma in this \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANRysL9XH\"\u003e“In the file” livestream\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s how Elsewhen helped their clients, Spotify and Inmarsat, improve their productivity through collaboration in Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"improving-productivity-and-creativity-at-spotify\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#improving-productivity-and-creativity-at-spotify\"\u003eImproving productivity and creativity at Spotify\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow can design organizations better measure and evaluate designer productivity? And how can we improve it without compromising the creative process? These are the kinds of questions that Spotify was grappling with at the start of last year. “Measuring productivity for a creative role,” the Spotify design team wrote in a \u003ca href=\"https://spotify.design/article/measuring-defining-and-improving-productivity-the-design-productivity\"\u003erecent blog post\u003c/a\u003e, “is a treacherous undertaking. For example, it would be a mistake to just count the number of screens, components or even solutions a designer creates, or the time it takes them to produce each one, so we need to identify the metrics that it does make sense to measure.” Driven by the idea that improving design productivity could be the key to unlocking design creativity, Spotify tapped Elsewhen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eTogether, they created a framework that would help design teams understand current workflow challenges and locate key opportunities—the \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/934395237081404612\"\u003eDesign Productivity Blueprint\u003c/a\u003e. The framework is an open-sourced Figma file that contains a collection of workshops and interview templates that any team can use. With the tool, Spotify and Elsewhen hope that they’ll help design teams spend more of their time designing and less time on the tasks that slow them down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3e8df3e9fbadd36d7023ff4ed05dd8eed7f928c1-512x423.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=554\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3e8df3e9fbadd36d7023ff4ed05dd8eed7f928c1-512x423.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3e8df3e9fbadd36d7023ff4ed05dd8eed7f928c1-512x423.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3e8df3e9fbadd36d7023ff4ed05dd8eed7f928c1-512x423.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 512w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"building-a-foundational-design-system-for-inmarsat\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#building-a-foundational-design-system-for-inmarsat\"\u003eBuilding a foundational design system for Inmarsat\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eInmarsat is a British telecommunications company that keeps the world connected through satellite communication networks. While they’re able to deliver world-class communication solutions across cities and companies—even ships and planes—around the world, they’re not immune from the challenges of being a distributed workforce. Across their many offices, building and evolving their products as a team was proving to be quite difficult, particularly when it came to design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInmarsat doesn’t have an internal design team, so they rely on agencies for design partnership. While this model can offer greater flexibility to meet changing needs over time, it can also lead to a disconnect between in-house developers and new designers who may not have sufficient context or tools. And because Inmarsat didn’t have a single source of truth for their most commonly used design components, files, and assets, onboarding and managing these designers was a heavy lift. “They were constantly rebuilding components from scratch,” recalls Matt Soczywko, Head of Marketing at Elsewhen. “This of course prolonged the process in which they shipped products.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo change this, Inmarsat began working with Elsewhen, who was tasked with creating their first design system in Figma. “To develop their design system, we used an ongoing project that Inmarsat was already working on—a self-service portal for their enterprise customers,” Elsewhen’s founder, Tadhg McCarthy, explained. “This gave us the foundational elements that would form the new component libraries.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom there, the Elsewhen team developed a framework for common components like type, buttons, icons, grids, and more. “Not only was there now a source of truth for our design components in Figma, all the designers and developers across the organization and our partnering agencies can now easily access critical design assets,” said Brandon James, Director of Marketing, Inmarsat. “Now as a business, we’re building new products faster and staying ahead of the curve of technological change.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?rect=0,0,1023,678\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=444\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1023w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"7d26fbf1ebaf\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo learn more about how Elsewhen helps companies design products that improve workflows, increase efficiency, and ultimately make people happier at work \u003ca href=\"https://www.elsewhen.com/blog\"\u003echeck out their blog\u003c/a\u003e.

As organizations of all sizes scale their design operations, systems play a critical role in enabling product teams to move faster, more consistently, and adapt to evolving business needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack when I first learned about systems as a designer, everything was much more static and linear. Designers built and shared PDF style guides, which served as documentation for reusable design decisions. Developers interpreted those guides into a stylesheet that closely resembled decisions in code. These workflows were often siloed across tools and teams, making alignment challenging—particularly amongst design adjacent collaborators. (If you’ve ever received mockups of rectangles in a slide deck, you know what I’m talking about!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe have come a long way since then. Today, the landscape is built around collaboration, visibility, and flexible tooling—all in the name of creating shared understanding. During my time at Figma, I’ve have had the opportunity to meet so many amazing design systems practitioners, from those working on smaller teams where their design system is a grassroots effort, to others at large organizations with dedicated design systems and operations teams. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbove all, they’re deeply motivated by helping others. They take great pride in building systems that allow teams to spend less time thinking about organization and processes, and more on solving tough problems. And what’s even more encouraging is that cross-functional contributors, who may have never found themselves in a design tool five years ago, are now more integrated into the design process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Figma, we think a lot about these challenges through the lens of the product. Libraries, components and styles are part of it, but we also know how important communication, measurement, and contribution are to the people creating resources to help others. And if there’s one thing we’ve learned, everyone—regardless of their organization’s scale—is still figuring it out!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#39;s why we’ve created a space to do just that.

Hackers love to target critical security controls like this to break into production and steal user data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Figma, we used this approach, too, for a few years. But as we scaled, managing and securing access became difficult and increasingly time consuming. So in mid-2020, we decided to build our own modern, zero-trust shell access system that’s more secure, easy to support, and simple to use. Here, I’ll share the story of how we built and rolled out this project, along with detailed advice so you can try this approach yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen designing our system, we had a few important goals in mind.

However, they weren’t flexible enough to support existing use cases easily and weren’t always available to us at our size. We were also concerned that external dependencies would add unnecessary complexity and introduce a potential source of availability risk into critical engineering workflows. Since we already used many AWS services in our infrastructure, we instead decided to explore building a simple, proof-of-concept design, using AWS components as building blocks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnter: \u003ca href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/\"\u003eAWS Systems Manager\u003c/a\u003e, a set of operational tools for AWS infrastructure. For our purposes, Systems Manager can provide shell access to EC2 and ECS instances through a feature called \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html\"\u003eSession Manager\u003c/a\u003e, where the instances don’t need to expose a SSH port or be accessible by any external networks at all.

Session Manager connections support running commands, starting an interactive shell, and even tunneling SSH sessions. Permissions can be centrally managed through IAM roles assumable by human users authenticating through AWS SSO.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"sso-and-access-control-leveraging-existing\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#sso-and-access-control-leveraging-existing\"\u003eSSO and access control: leveraging existing investments\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt a high level, we use Okta, our SSO provider, with AWS SSO to provide strong, centrally managed authentication with required device trust and required WebAuthN for multi-factor authentication. (For more details on how we rolled out WebAuthN at Figma, check out \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/frgx/status/1379504541666701313\"\u003ethis thread\u003c/a\u003e from \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/frgx\"\u003eDev\u003c/a\u003e, who leads our team.) After authenticating, users assume a dedicated, minimally-privileged IAM role with short-lived AWS access tokens to begin a shell session via Session Manager. For auditing, Session Manager collects and sends session transcripts to an encrypted S3 bucket.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?rect=0,0,1792,963\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=360\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIntegrating \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/okta-idp.html\"\u003eOkta with AWS SSO\u003c/a\u003e with group push was straightforward, and it allows our IT team to easily manage access control with Okta groups.

At a high level, an attacker could generate their own device authorization URL and attempt to trick a victim into visiting that URL and authorizing that request in order to retrieve an access token for the victim. Although engineers should find it suspicious to encounter an unprompted SSO page, we also added monitoring and alerts as additional mitigations for this scenario.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"setting-up-session-manager\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#setting-up-session-manager\"\u003eSetting Up Session Manager\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAWS has detailed guides for setting up Session Manager for \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-getting-started.html\"\u003eEC2\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/new-using-amazon-ecs-exec-access-your-containers-fargate-ec2/\"\u003eECS\u003c/a\u003e.

For example, for EC2, the target instance must have permissions to create and open SSM message channels, and the user IAM role must have SSM session permissions on the target instance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, for ECS, the task definition needs SSM message channel permissions, and the user IAM role must have \u003ccode\u003eExecuteCommand\u003c/code\u003e permissions on the target container. ECS also requires a new KMS CMK, and key permissions must be configured to encrypt session logs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"adding-guardrails-for-users\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#adding-guardrails-for-users\"\u003eAdding guardrails for users\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor defense-in-depth, you can restrict IAM permissions to access or modify SSM documents, such as \u003ccode\u003eSSM-SessionManagerRunShell\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003eAWS-StartSSHSession\u003c/code\u003e, to prevent users from getting a shell or tunneling SSH, or to require that your users use your own customized SSM configuration if you wish to restrict specific SSM workflows.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you prefer to only expose certain commands to users, SSM \u003ccode\u003eRunCommand\u003c/code\u003e can be used to construct safe one-off invocations instead of providing a full interactive shell.

For example, because \u003ccode\u003eaws-ssm-agent\u003c/code\u003e is pre-installed on many AMIs, an IAM user or role with sufficient Session Manager permissions can get a shell on an instance using that AMI, even if it has no configured network access.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are some of the main mitigations we implemented that you may want to consider, depending on your needs:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAudit whether any IAM users have System Manager permissions. Better yet, completely migrate away from long-lived IAM users, if possible.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor human users, grant the minimum necessary System Manager permissions to only those IAM roles that need them, limit the session duration of those roles, and restrict which instances can be connected to. AWS Systems Manager encompasses a large number of different IAM permissions, most of which are not required to start a shell session. Be careful if you use a default AWS SSM IAM policy; some of them grant very broad permissions, including full S3 access!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor similar reasons, grant only the necessary System Manager permissions for instance or task definition IAM policies.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"for-cli-fans\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#for-cli-fans\"\u003eFor CLI fans\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor users who prefer a CLI, we configured a seamless experience tying web-based SSO with CLI tools. This workflow received overwhelming positive feedback from our users. As one Figma engineer said, “[This] is really fun to use.

Because some critical workflows like deploys depended heavily on SSH, we continued to support SSH connections but required tunneling through Session Manager, as I explained earlier. That resulted in both a usability win and a security win—existing users saw no real change to their normal SSH workflow aside from the new SSO requirement, and possessing an SSH key no longer granted SSH access by itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe gave users several weeks of notice to migrate to the new workflow while we allowed both tunneled SSH (SSH over SSM) and non-tunneled SSH (classic SSH) in the interim. That gave all users a grace period to switch over. After the deadline, we blocked all inbound connections from the internet (i.e., inbound SSH connections) to our bastions. This meant that SessionManager was now the only way to get shell access in our environment. To remain robust against potential SSM issues, a select few Figma engineers have the ability to remove these blocks in a break-glass situation, which will also fire off alerts for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne downside of tunneled SSH is that Session Manager acts only as a wrapper and thus cannot provide full session transcripts of the encrypted SSH traffic, so other tooling is needed to audit SSH connections. Instead, we eventually deprecated the need for tunneled SSH with a simple script as a convenient drop-in replacement for SSH. As described earlier, our script leverages the AWS CLI to call either \u003ccode\u003eaws ssm start-session\u003c/code\u003e for EC2 instances or \u003ccode\u003eaws ecs execute-command\u003c/code\u003e for ECS instances. Thus, our script \u003ca href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/new-using-amazon-ecs-exec-access-your-containers-fargate-ec2/\"\u003eworks with containers\u003c/a\u003e—whereas SSH does not—and allows developers to easily switch between different profiles used in our multi-account AWS environment.

Now, you can quickly add a question to your cursor or hop on a call to chat with your teammates while you’re working together in the same file. And if you’re jamming in FigJam, you can even high-five.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"13b374fc3379\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince day one, Figma has opened the doors for teammates to work in the same file together. But working together sometimes requires more than just being in the same digital space. Like everyone, we’ve encountered our fair share of challenges when it comes to remote collaboration. We experienced the pain of switching between tools to ask that quick question or clarify one key point. So, we set out to solve those challenges, while bringing back the serendipity of in-person interactions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are introducing audio and cursor chat to recreate those magical moments—a spontaneous brainstorm at a teammate’s desk or a quick chair swivel to catch-up with a co-worker—directly in Figma and FigJam. And for those moments of joy when you figure something out in a jam session, you can even high five in FigJam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-magic-of-in-person-in-the-file\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-magic-of-in-person-in-the-file\"\u003eThe magic of in-person, in the file\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we started building audio and cursor chat, top of mind was creating a single space for users to interact with each other, so they don’t have to toggle between other tools. This additional level of collaboration needed to be fast and low-friction; teams shouldn’t need to download something, configure settings, or add an additional step like dialing a phone number or sending out a calendar invite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbove all, we want to complement—not replace—existing workflows. While these new ways to communicate in a file are built to enable synchronous collaboration, we know that some collaboration will be asynchronous, requiring teammates to work independently before getting input from others. Whatever your workflows look like, here are a few ways audio and cursor chat can help you jam, brainstorm, and workshop—together:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"in-context-collaboration\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#in-context-collaboration\"\u003eIn-context collaboration\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you get stuck or want to workshop something live, you can share the link to the file and talk it out. Audio and cursor chat both allow you to share thoughts and feedback in real time in Figma and FigJam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"lightweight-jam-sessions\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#lightweight-jam-sessions\"\u003eLightweight jam sessions\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are times when video makes meetings more human, and there are times when you just don’t need it. Rather than jumping on a video call for a brainstorm, you can use audio and cursor chat to jam together, without switching between apps. You can \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/964652140702534507\"\u003estart with a template\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402269549591-Stay-on-track-with-the-timer-in-FigJam\"\u003eset a timer\u003c/a\u003e, and get to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"spontaneous-syncs\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#spontaneous-syncs\"\u003eSpontaneous syncs\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of a chance encounter in the hallway, you can “run into” a colleague in a file and riff on a design, ask a quick question, or request feedback to work through a problem. Saying hello through your cursor or hopping on a quick audio call can help your team regain those lost moments of serendipity in a remote world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eInvite your teammate over cursor chat before chatting with them over audio\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAudio, cursor chat, and high fives are just the start.

While I’ve pivoted back and forth from product design and education throughout my career, I was most recently an Assistant Professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, where I taught interaction design classes. As an educator, I saw firsthand how students can learn valuable design skills in Figma and wanted to help others adopt the platform that was so inspiring to me. In fact, last year when \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/bringing-figma-to-even-more-classrooms/\"\u003eFigma expanded Figma for Education\u003c/a\u003e, I was still teaching at RIT. I partnered with the team here to \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/@miggi\"\u003epublish teaching materials\u003c/a\u003e, based on class activities and lessons I would give to students.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis year marks my first “back to school” season since joining Figma, and I wanted to share some reflections, including ways that Figma can support educators and students alike. Figma’s Education plan gives students and educators the ability to create teams with all the Professional perks completely free, with unlimited collaboration. Starting today, we’re also are making it easier for classrooms to collaborate with new, simplified onboarding processes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"for-educators-enabling-a-virtual-classroom\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#for-educators-enabling-a-virtual-classroom\"\u003eFor educators: enabling a virtual classroom\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIntroducing Figma to my User Experience classes back in 2018 marked a paradigm shift in my pedagogy. It was not only a tool that facilitated learning and development, but also a space where we gathered, ran activities, and shared feedback on each other’s work. Here is how other educators and I have seen Figma change the way we teach:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport for different styles of teaching.\u003c/strong\u003e When everyone had to shift to remote learning last year, I was so grateful that my class was already using Figma—the only thing that changed was the location. As educators adapt to accommodate the combination of in person and remote work, real-time and asynchronous collaboration, Figma makes it so anyone can participate.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA single source of truth for class materials.\u003c/strong\u003e By aggregating all work in Figma, it’s easy to track conversations and assignments. For example, instructors \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHtEf0HkCzY\"\u003eSteph Kotula and Rian Long\u003c/a\u003e of Portland State University used one Figma file with multiple pages as a space for all lectures, design activities, and critiques. It serves as an artifact, allowing students to reference class materials or catch up on missed lessons.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore engaged, inclusive classrooms.\u003c/strong\u003e The magic of Figma happens when there’s more than one person in a file and the ideas start to flow, allowing teams to riff, iterate, and build on each other’s work. In my own classroom, new dynamics emerged and social norms changed—I noticed that some of my quiet students begin to participate more actively. Deaf and hard of hearing students told me that the visual format enabled a more level playing field. Creating channels for active participation in varying formats opens doors for more collaboration.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA space for community.\u003c/strong\u003e Particularly in this time of hybrid remote and in-person learning, fostering a sense of togetherness is important. \u003ca href=\"https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/julianne-burke/26667\"\u003eJulianne Burke\u003c/a\u003e, who teaches a course on the foundations of UX/UI, has her students create a yearbook in Figma.

She exports them as PDFs for the students to keep after the course is over.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;d like to learn more about using Figma as an educator, \u003ca href=\"https://figma.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_c_RbC2ZNTjec-9ZCwEsUqg\"\u003esign up for a group demo\u003c/a\u003e.

By building products that solve challenges for people living with disabilities, students get hands-on design experience while making a positive impact.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the past six years, program creator \u003ca href=\"https://www.dcdesignltd.com/about\"\u003eDurrell Coleman\u003c/a\u003e has partnered with institutions like the \u003ca href=\"https://dschool.stanford.edu/\"\u003eStanford d.school\u003c/a\u003e and Boston University to run in-person workshops across the U.S. During each session, four high school students pair up with a university coach and a project partner—someone who shares the unique challenges they face living with a disability. In turn, the students design solutions to those obstacles through the lens of their project partner’s perspective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the last two summers, the in-person format wasn’t an option. So, Coleman and the Design the Future team set out to rethink the approach for an all-remote environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKnowing that the program would require eight hours of online collaboration each day, avoiding Zoom fatigue was top of mind. For this to work, the Design the Future team had to find a tool that was easy, intuitive, and one that students genuinely enjoyed using.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, the team tested Figma because it had all of the features Coleman needed to create workspaces for student activities. But, it would be tough for the students to spin up on Figma, given the short duration of the workshop. Instead, they transitioned to Figma’s online whiteboard, \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/figjam/\"\u003eFigJam\u003c/a\u003e. FigJam was quick for students to pick up, allowed for interactivity in the file, and Coleman could copy and paste the templates he already made in Figma straight into FigJam.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“FigJam was a game changer for us.

There are a number of steps in the design process that require different altitudes of feedback; learning how to manage and incorporate input along the way is central to the program’s teachings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s why Coleman created one ultimate FigJam team whiteboard to guide students through the process. After building designs in Figma, he migrated them into FigJam to serve as templates.

Tasked with preparing the next generation of innovators, educators must constantly evolve their curriculums stay relevant and up-to-date with the needs of a demanding industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to providing students with a creative, forward-looking curriculum, The Fashion Institute of Technology has always led the way. In fact, just two years after the first iPhone launched, FIT had a user experience design course up and running. Professors \u003ca href=\"https://www.fitnyc.edu/graphic-design/faculty/christie-shin.php\"\u003eChristie Shin\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.fitnyc.edu/advertising-design/faculty/cj-yeh.php\"\u003eC.J. Yeh\u003c/a\u003e led that charge, and each of them continues to push programming at FIT today. Here, we’ll dive into Professor Shin’s courses in the Advertising and Digital Design program.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn everything she does, Shin emphasizes the importance of teaching systems thinking, facilitating tight feedback loops, and providing an environment where ideas can be exchanged openly among students. Naturally, collaboration is core to that approach—which is why Figma has become an increasingly central component of her classroom workflows. In her UI course, for example, Shin constructs a virtual classroom in Figma. She organizes it into \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/best-practices/getting-started-with-teams-in-figma-organization/#:~:text=In%20Figma%20Organization%20you%20can,file%20organization%20and%20user%20permissions.\u0026amp;text=A%20team%20can%20have%20its,levels%20of%20visibility%20within%20Figma.\"\u003eFigma teams\u003c/a\u003e that correspond to each lecture section.

As the course progresses, she provides an organized structure to learn and develop design skills. In the process, she has developed four principles for facilitating collaborative design in the classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"professor-shin-s-principles-for-a-collaborative\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#professor-shin-s-principles-for-a-collaborative\"\u003eProfessor Shin’s principles for a collaborative virtual classroom\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_1-celebrate-early-work\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_1-celebrate-early-work\"\u003e1. Celebrate early work\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou don’t have to be a designer to know that it can feel intimidating to share ideas before they’re ready. But in Shin’s class, students work in open team environments, and they’re encouraged to embrace that discomfort on a daily basis. To help them develop a muscle for requesting and responding to early feedback, she encourages students to frequently pop into each other’s work to share input out loud and in the file during each class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Working together in Figma helps students understand that design is a way of thinking rather than the creation of a precious object.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_2-guide-the-process-while-providing-room-to-grow\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_2-guide-the-process-while-providing-room-to-grow\"\u003e2.

At the top of the semester, students receive a set of files, each containing pages of named templates for the various activities in the course. While each page focuses around a purposeful and structured template, the infinite canvas around it leaves space open for sketches, ideas, and quick iterations. This makes it easy for students to turn a single Figma file into a design journal—one page might hold a research activity and a summary, while the next contains wireframes. Shin calls each of her students’ Figma files a “creative journey.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_3-work-individually-together\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_3-work-individually-together\"\u003e3. Work individually, together\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven for solo projects, students work within study groups. In one exercise last year, Shin tasked each student with creating a design system for the MTA app, complete with a video case study. The students met in their study groups to present their progress and, rather than waiting for feedback during the final presentation, exchanged feedback incrementally. This structure more closely echoes real-world design workplaces, where professionals work on cross-functional teams and hold formal \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/design-critiques-at-figma/\"\u003edesign critiques\u003c/a\u003e. In order for students to produce their best work, Shin says, they need to feel less precious about their designs and develop a habit of continuously adding in feedback from peers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=324\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_4-embrace-your-influences\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_4-embrace-your-influences\"\u003e4. Embrace your influences\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesigners are inherently influenced by other designers and each other. Before using Figma, students had a tendency to hide work and not share until the end, worried that someone else might steal their idea. Shin focuses on the idea that it’s okay—and expected—for work to be shaped by others. Rather than thinking about it as stealing ideas, she reframes it as a central part of the design process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShe equally emphasizes the importance of recognizing and giving credit to students’ influences. On each project, students are required to collect images of designs, whether from professional designers or each other, that informed their work. This way, the discussion of influence is included within the project itself and can be discussed in its critique.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=324\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"get-started\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#get-started\"\u003eGet started\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTake a deep dive with Professors Christie Shin and C.J.

This is not just because we love our users (we do!) but also, selfishly, we run into a lot of these challenges firsthand. Since we’ve built Figma and FigJam \u003cem\u003ein\u003c/em\u003e Figma and FigJam, we realize that certain parts of the design process can be faster, more interactive, or even automated. This leaves you with more time to focus on what you do best—creating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo that end, over the last month we’ve released new features and capabilities—for design teams, by our design team—to help make working in Figma better. We have sped up workflows, made it easier to maintain your design systems, and introduced new ways to customize your experience in both Figma and FigJam. If you\u0026#39;re interested in learning more, read on for the full recap:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe know no two jam sessions are alike. Sometimes, you need to think through a user journey with a teammate. Other times, you need to bring in more people to crowdsource and vote on ideas. To help make brainstorms and workshops more tailored to how you and your team collaborate, we’re bringing our open platform to FigJam—with plugins to automate workflows and widgets to engage the entire team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlugins make your individual workflows more efficient, whether you’re customizing styles, organizing stickies, or importing data. Widgets are interactive canvas objects that the entire team can use together. From voting and polls to notepads and games, widgets make facilitation a breeze and bring a spark of joy to every jam session.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur plugin and widget APIs are flexible, allowing you to build for a variety of use cases. But we’ve also made it simple to get started. If you know basic HTML and Javascript, you can build a plugin. And if you’re familiar with React, you can build a widget.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsers on every plan can start building plugins today.

This means developers can build plugins to automate the prototype creation process, or update and modify interactions in bulk. With this update, we hope to see plugins become a powerful tool to improve prototyping workflows, just like they are for design work.

Our team was thoughtful about making this API approachable from the start—we knew designers and developers were excited about customizing their workflows, and we didn’t want the learning curve to feel prohibitive. That’s why one of our primary principles when building our plugin API was, “if you can build a website, you should be able to make a plugin.” If you know simple JavaScript and HTML, that’s enough to get started.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday we’re bringing our open platform to FigJam with those same principles in mind. And because FigJam is all about jamming together, we’re taking it one step further by making sure our platform supports more collaborative use cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlugins can be tremendously powerful for automating individual workflows, like turning a CSV into a grid of sticky notes or adding tags to sticky notes to help with synthesis. But for a collaborative tool like FigJam, we knew builders would also want an API that could enable collaborative and interactive experiences—from voting, to polls, to on-canvas games. That’s why we’re also releasing an API for building custom interactive widgets that teams can drag and drop directly into their boards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eAn example poll widget that enables everyone in the file to vote across different options\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike plugins, the widget API is a declarative and functional API. It lets you define how your widget looks using a set of components (\u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;Frame/\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;Rectangle/\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;Text/\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;SVG/\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e etc.) and add event listeners that can run arbitrary code on user interaction, such as click events. It also allows you to have custom in-line property menus just like native FigJam objects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan\u003e// This widget consists of an auto

similar to plugins, flexibility isn’t all we had in mind—we wanted to make sure widgets would be equally straightforward to build.

While the designers appreciated Figma’s flexibility, other teams sometimes felt intimidated by the more advanced features.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince then, we’ve transitioned many of these activities to \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/figjam/\"\u003eFigJam\u003c/a\u003e, which gives designers a space to collaborate in the earliest stages of the design process, while empowering cross-functional partners to contribute.

But this aspect can be a bit of a double-edged sword in the earliest stages of the design process, when the focus should be on ideating and brainstorming, rather than creating something pixel-perfect. The beauty of doing earlier work in FigJam is that it reduces that temptation to polish and refine an idea that’s supposed to be illustrative, instead keeping teams focused on the ideas themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn building FigJam, making the experience fun and delightful was top of mind. To source new ideas, Product Designer \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jenny_wen\"\u003eJenny Wen\u003c/a\u003e hosted a workshop that prompted the team to imagine how users might react when we officially announced features like cursor chat, emoji reactions, and stamps.

At this stage, Jenny wasn’t looking for specific phrases or images—it was really about getting at a feeling, brainstorming ideas that users would have a positive emotional reaction to. It might seem counterintuitive, but narrowing the scope of the workshop actually helped the team get more ideas down quickly, without getting stuck in the weeds. Once finished, the team could easily find and reference the brainstorm, pull the most popular ideas into a Figma file, and start riffing on designs that eventually resulted in live FigJam features.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"mapping-async-input\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#mapping-async-input\"\u003eMapping async input\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Jenny was working through how to attribute ideas in FigJam, there were a lot of open questions. If we were going to show names on sticky notes in FigJam, we’d still have figure out whether we should allow people to edit their names, how the name might change if someone else changes the sticky, or what happens if a collaborator copies and pastes it. Untangling this specific interaction required input from product managers, engineers, and designers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter sharing the first version of sticky note attribution, Jenny used FigJam to visually aggregate feedback that she gathered from early alpha testers and teammates. Once she grouped the input, she built out a decision tree alongside the team’s notes, then shared the file and proposed solution over Slack.

I have a fairly technical background but I was interested in a fast-paced and product-focused role, so I focused on early-stage data teams at rapidly growing startups. I was also looking for an empathetic culture, which is a personal choice—I’m always thinking about how to connect and communicate with others and want to be surrounded by people who are the same.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaniela:\u003c/strong\u003e I was searching for authenticity in culture and in people. At Figma, Figmates come to work with an intention to build real community—it’s actually one of our cultural values! I also wanted to work with people who care deeply about Figma\u0026#39;s mission and users.

I wanted a good idea of how companies focused on helping engineers progress. How do young engineers feel? Do they have ownership over their project? Are they making an impact on any of the company’s larger goals? I also like to ask engineers if the company is a place they could stay long term, because it hints at whether they feel like that their career is stagnant at this company or if there’s opportunity for career growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWere there any tools or resources that helped you figure out what you wanted in an early career role?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmily:\u003c/strong\u003e I prioritized exploring multiple companies and roles as an undergraduate through summer and off-cycle internships. Conversations with alumni and interviewers during my senior year also brought to light less obvious tradeoffs between early career choices. Beyond hearing about their day-to-day, I found it helpful to hear how they’d grown in the role and think, “do I want this for myself?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLangston:\u003c/strong\u003e I mainly discovered what I wanted through internships, where you quickly realize what you do and don’t enjoy working on. During the job search process, I tried to speak to as many engineers as I could and ask their advice. A lot of them said the same thing: finding a supportive team and manager who helps you grow is just as important as what you’re working on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat drew you to Figma?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEmily:\u003c/strong\u003e Prior to interviewing, I came across \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-my-time-as-a-new-grad/\"\u003ethis blog post\u003c/a\u003e by Josh Shi, a software engineering new grad on the design systems team. I really appreciated his perspective, and thought it was telling that Figma gave him a platform to share it. Once I started interviewing, I learned that the data team was at an inflection point in terms of growth and influence, making its first new grad hires, and being really thoughtful about team culture. That was (and still is) really exciting to me!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLangston:\u003c/strong\u003e I spoke with quite a few Figma engineers before joining the company. The thing that really stood out to me was their excitement around Figma’s products. It quickly became clear to me that I would get the opportunity to own innovative projects that would help me grow as an engineer, which was ultimately the deciding factor for me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaniela:\u003c/strong\u003e I became familiar with Figma while working on a side project—one of my friends uses Figma avidly and she worked on that project with me. I would get so excited to see her designs, jam on potential changes, and add feedback. Not only was I super in love with the product, I also really appreciate Figma\u0026#39;s culture of celebrating individuality and building community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJago:\u003c/strong\u003e Figma kickstarted my career in design helped me learn what great design means. I wanted to help contribute to the mission of democratizing design—with programs like \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/education/\"\u003eFigma for Education\u003c/a\u003e, I knew I could do that on the Figma Community team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did you prepare for interviews at Figma?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaniela:\u003c/strong\u003e I did some interview prep to make sure I was familiar with all the basic data structures and algorithms, and I practiced problems that I generally have a harder time with, like dynamic programming and recursion problems. \u003ca href=\"https://interviews.school/\"\u003eInterviews.school\u003c/a\u003e was a helpful refresher on general interview topics and LeetCode was helpful as practice. \u003ca href=\"https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/\"\u003eCracking the Coding Interview\u003c/a\u003e is also a useful book when I need a refresher about a specific data structure or concept and I want to learn it again from the start!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJago:\u003c/strong\u003e Knowing that the interview was going to be a portfolio presentation, I created a deck and practiced presenting it several times with friends, family, and other designers. To know what to put in the presentation and how to format it, I attended several workshops with \u003ca href=\"https://www.designbuddies.community/\"\u003eDesign Buddies\u003c/a\u003e, looked at \u003ca href=\"https://cofolios.com/\"\u003eCofolios\u003c/a\u003e, and learned from my peers around me. I also used mentoring resources such as \u003ca href=\"https://www.adplist.org/\"\u003eADPlist\u003c/a\u003e and LinkedIn for interview tips and wisdom on what hiring managers wanted to see in the case studies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLangston:\u003c/strong\u003e Interviewing is hard and it’s easy to get stressed! To practice, I’d run through 10-20 practice interviews with a group of friends, switching between asking and answering questions. It’s not as boring as it sounds and you’re able to learn a lot by watching others interview and answer questions yourself. For the behavioral interviews, I would recommend spending some time looking at \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/under-the-hood-of-figmas-infrastructure/\"\u003eFigma’s engineering blog posts\u003c/a\u003e.

Interviewing is really hard and it’s easy to get wrapped up in needing to land the perfect role right after graduation. In reality, many people I know got experience in a few different roles in those first couple of years. Remember that your worth is not defined by any one job—the version of you with the job is just as worthy as the person you are right now, when you’re still looking for it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLangston:\u003c/strong\u003e My best advice would be to spend time practicing interview questions. In my experience, interviewing has been a skill that is greatly improved through repetition. I would also suggest listing out what’s important to you in a position, and then make sure you ask your interviewers about those things, which will help with decision-making.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaniela:\u003c/strong\u003e Rather than building deep knowledge on specific coding languages, I\u0026#39;d suggest gaining breadth by picking up new languages and frameworks. I use personal and team coding projects—even non-technical ones—to build important collaboration skills, like navigating team conflict. And let yourself gravitate towards what you find interesting and fun! If possible, your projects should be a reflection of what excites you and brings you energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJago:\u003c/strong\u003e Never be afraid to ask for help at work. As designers, we tend to only show our best work, but ask early for visual craft questions, ideas and run throughs!

Recently, I collaborated with the Growth team to test the hypothesis that providing context about \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/figjam/\"\u003eFigJam\u003c/a\u003e use cases could add clarity to FigJam users’ experiences. I ran an experiment that displayed FigJam templates alongside a more prominent FigJam entry point in the Figma File Browser, and our new design triggered a significant increase in collaborative FigJam file creation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLangston:\u003c/strong\u003e My team’s year-long project is to migrate our data to a horizontally sharded model.

Initially, the project was more limited in scope, but I had the opportunity to ask questions that broadened the project\u0026#39;s reach and impact. I also got the chance to edit the project to make it more specific and valuable to Figma’s users. It’s a large-scale but meaningful project, and the whole experience has taught me a lot about taking ownership and running with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow have you grown since coming to Figma?\u003cbr/\u003eJago:\u003c/strong\u003e My mentors have enabled me to push my designs further, be confident in my work, and be proactive about what I do in my time here. During mid-point feedback, my mentor encouraged me to be more visible with my work and not to be shy to post more often in Slack channels, ask for help or to jam on something, and send updates on my feature. This changed my perspective on the internship—I was part of more conversations and ended up being more proactive in taking on necessary projects that no one asked me to take. Even the smallest comments on the file let me understand where I could make the most impact!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDaniela:\u003c/strong\u003e I flourished in Figma\u0026#39;s culture of loving your craft.

As a result, our solution focuses on using components provided by those platforms to achieve our goals. AWS Application Load Balancers (ALBs) support authentication of user traffic through a variety of means; often companies configure them with OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication in situations like this. However, Okta charges extra for OIDC support, so we explored other options. You can also configure an ALB to authenticate users with plain SAML, as long as you pair it with an AWS Cognito user pool—this has some other advantages that we’ll get to later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=355\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo automate the creation of ALB and Cognito resources with the right configuration, our team built Terraform modules in accordance with our infrastructure-as-code philosophy. These modules allow any infrastructure engineer to quickly get an ALB up and running that authenticates users through our Okta deployment. The specific details of the configuration here are too long for this post (\u003ca href=\"mailto:maxb@figma.com\"\u003edrop me a line if you’re looking for some code samples\u003c/a\u003e!), but here’s the basic configuration:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe create a Cognito User Pool that disallows user registration. It is connected to a Cognito Identity Provider associated with a SAML Okta application provisioned for this internal app. Notably, we configure the Identity Provider to have mappings for the \u003ccode\u003eemail\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eprofile\u003c/code\u003e attributes, so that these are passed through the SAML assertion into the Cognito identity statement.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe create a Cognito User Pool Client for the ALB to use, which specifies the ALB’s Oauth2 callback URL, enables the authorization code Oauth2 flow, and specifies which user attributes will be set during login (\u003ccode\u003eemail\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eprofile\u003c/code\u003e are specifically included here, again).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFinally, we create an ALB object that is configured to authenticate all HTTPS traffic using the User Pool Client created above, before forwarding traffic to the application that we’re trying to expose. All HTTP traffic will be redirected to the HTTPS port.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce these pieces are in place, users will automatically be redirected to Okta upon trying to visit the ALB. Assuming that they can successfully authenticate and have been assigned the app in Okta, their request will then be passed on to the internal application. Until their session expires, the user will not see any further authentication prompts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis setup has a few key advantages:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOkta provides advanced authentication features, like \u003ca href=\"https://webauthn.guide/\"\u003eWebAuthn\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/device-trust/device-trust-landing.htm\"\u003eDevice Trust\u003c/a\u003e verification. These are set up in our organization-wide Okta policies and can also be applied to the application as sign-in rules. As a result, we can require that for sensitive applications like our deploy manager, users be on a Figma-managed device and use their phish-proof, hardware MFA tokens.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eALBs can enable a number of useful security features with just a few clicks (or one \u003ccode\u003eterraform apply\u003c/code\u003e)—for instance, they \u003ca href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/application-and-classic-load-balancers-adding-defense-in-depth-with-introduction-of-desync-mitigation-mode/\"\u003enatively support HTTP desync mitigation\u003c/a\u003e, can be monitored with an \u003ca href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/waf/\"\u003eAWS Web Application Firewall\u003c/a\u003e, and they’re patched automatically by AWS.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBecause all of the traffic that gets forwarded to our backend has already been parsed and processed by the ALB, the servers that we maintain are shielded against some broad classes of attacks. For example, memory corruption attacks against HTTP or TLS parsing are significantly harder to pull off against our internal servers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe ALB supports a customizable session timeout. This allows us to ensure that users have to re-authenticate with a trusted device every x hours, where x can vary based on the sensitivity of the application in question.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"getting-specific-using-okta-groups-for-fine\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#getting-specific-using-okta-groups-for-fine\"\u003eGetting specific: using Okta groups for fine-grained authorization\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eConnecting internal applications to Okta apps via ALBs is a great start along the road to internal user authorization. Using Okta application assignments, we can control which employees can see each application. However, this is a coarse-grained mechanism. We have a number of applications that have broad use cases across the organization, but specific functionality that is best to keep more limited. Take the deployment app, for example: it’s desirable to let any engineer deploy their branch to their personal development environment; only the release manager should be able to deploy to production. Splitting this functionality across two different apps would be challenging from a management and UX perspective, so we built a mechanism to express more Okta authorization context to the underlying application.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis approach relies on the \u003ccode\u003eprofile\u003c/code\u003e attribute that was mentioned above. With the right combination of configurations, we can send information about which Okta Groups a user belongs to through their SAML assertion, into Cognito, along through the ALB, and finally into the underlying app in the form of a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) in an HTTP header. Here’s how that combination works:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn the Okta application configuration, we set up a “Group attribute statement” named \u003ccode\u003eauthorization\u003c/code\u003e that specifies a set of Okta groups that should be sent to the underlying app. This specification can be a prefix match or a regex, and allows us to only send groups which might be relevant to the underlying application.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn the Cognito User Pool, the attribute mappings copy the \u003ccode\u003eauthorization\u003c/code\u003e statement into the \u003ccode\u003eprofile\u003c/code\u003e attribute. Because this attribute is present in the configuration for the Cognito User Pool Client, it will get set when a user logs in through the ALB.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003eprofile\u003c/code\u003e attribute will then contain the specified groups in the signed \u003ccode\u003ex-amzn-oidc-data\u003c/code\u003e header when sent to the application backend. \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html#user-claims-encoding\"\u003eAmazon describes how to parse this header here\u003c/a\u003e, but note that the approach may need to be tweaked depending on the language you are using and how strict its JWT libraries are.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eIf you’re not using Python and are therefore unable to use the sample code provided by Amazon, the following pseudocode describes the operations necessary to safely verify and extract the identity data provided in this JWT.

The signed header also includes the user’s email, allowing applications to have trustworthy logging about who is performing what actions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe went a step further in facilitating this hand-off with some opinionated guidance on how groups should be structured for this use case. It’s tempting to put users in groups based on their team or department in Okta, and then check those in your application code to validate whether an action should be allowed based on a user’s job function. However, this binds application logic to organizational structure, which is likely to change. It also makes it hard to quickly understand what permissions a particular team has been granted. Fortunately, Okta has a feature that allows you to bridge this gap: Group Rules.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGroup Rules allow you to assign a user to a group based on a predicate written in the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/\"\u003eOkta Expression Language\u003c/a\u003e. In our case, this means that we can create many groups—one for each permission—and then use rules to automatically assign those groups to users based on the team listed in their Okta profile. This way, applications can check for a specific group related to the permission, eg. \u003ccode\u003e#Deploys dev_environments\u003c/code\u003e, instead of checking for a list of team names. This has the added advantage of making it easy to see what permissions a team has: just check the Group Rules in Okta where the team is mentioned, and you’ll see all of the group relationships that that implies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=92\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eExample Group Rule\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo ensure that these associations are well-tracked and all changes are safely logged, we create them using the \u003ca href=\"https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oktadeveloper/okta/latest\"\u003eOkta Terraform Provider\u003c/a\u003e and check them into our repository along with the rest of our Terraform code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eNote: if an application needs extremely fine-grained permissions, it’s possible that the number of Okta groups sent in the JWT will make the token unreasonably large.

Soon after we set up the ALB-based authentication system described in this post, we wondered: how hard would it be to make API calls against our own internal services from a command line tool?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt first glance, it’s a challenge: the ALB-to-Okta authentication dance requires multiple redirects and complex browser functionality like WebAuthn. A CLI acting as a browser also wouldn’t be able to reuse the employee’s existing session. To get around these problems, we were inspired by the “browser pop” approach used by the \u003ca href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html\"\u003eAWS SSO CLI\u003c/a\u003e. By calling a library written by the Figma Security team, an internal CLI tool can trigger the user’s browser to open a page that will confirm the user’s intent to authenticate their terminal and forward the user’s ALB authentication cookie back to the CLI app. Because this is enabled by standard Terraform modules and client libraries, an engineer can enable CLI auth for their internal service with just three lines of code!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan\u003e// In the Terraform configuration for our \u0026#39;gateway_alb\u0026#39; module:\n\u003c/span\u003eallow_cli_auth = true\n// In a Typescript CLI tool:\nimport { cliAuthenticate } from \u0026#39;../../share/cli-auth\u0026#39;;\nconst authCookies = await cliAuthenticate(\u0026#39;https://deploys.figma.com\u0026#39;);\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?rect=0,0,1600,1067\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=447\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe CLI authentication confirmation screen\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is how the magic happens:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpon requesting authentication, the CLI uses Mac OS’s \u003ccode\u003eopen\u003c/code\u003e command to open a special route for the requested service in the user’s default browser.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA high-priority rule configured on the ALB routes that request to a Lambda function (maintained by the Security team). That function presents the confirmation dialog.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpon clicking “Authenticate in my terminal,\u0026#34; the Lambda will send the user’s ALB authentication cookies to a webserver that the CLI started on \u003ccode\u003e127.0.0.1\u003c/code\u003e, allowing the CLI to receive them and attach them to future API calls. This approach avoids the \u003ca href=\"https://blog.christophetd.fr/phishing-for-aws-credentials-via-aws-sso-device-code-authentication/\"\u003ephishing risks present in some device code authorization flows\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe CLI also stores the returned cookies in encrypted storage using the Mac OS keychain, so they never touch the disk in plain text.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are a few key security features to ensure a safe flow:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere’s a random state token that is generated by the CLI, passed through the web interaction, and included in the response to the local webserver. If any requests received by the local webserver lack the correct state token, they are immediately rejected.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe CLI ensures that the webserver can correctly bind to the designated port before opening the webpage. This ensures that it gets the cookie, not some other local service that was able to bind the port first.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe confirmation page is displayed with a very strict Content Security Policy that helps provide an additional layer of defense against web application attacks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks to this feature, our local CLI tools can do things like check deployment state or look up internal information with minimal code changes and a few clicks from the user.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fact that we are using Cognito User Pools to gate access to our internal ALBs has another advantage: User Pools don’t have to be limited to just SAML users. We’ve run into a few cases where we’d like to expose an internal application to a trusted guest; for instance, when giving access to a private beta. Because our ALB authentication is backed by the full capabilities of Cognito, we can make a new user account that’s unassociated with our Okta environment in the User Pool. Then, we can pass the credentials over to the partner and let them log in without having to provision them a Figma employee account.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnabling this is as simple as specifying the \u003ccode\u003eCOGNITO\u003c/code\u003e identity provider alongside your Okta one in the User Pool Client configuration for your ALB. As soon as you do this, the login page will switch to one that allows either Okta/SAML login or Cognito-based username \u0026amp; password login. Notably, this only works if a User Pool is very explicitly configured in this way—we leave this out of the defaults, so most internal apps will only support Okta logins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"bringing-it-all-together\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#bringing-it-all-together\"\u003eBringing it all together\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing the infrastructure components described above, we built a modern, highly secure application gateway product for internal use that doesn’t demand extensive, ongoing maintenance from the team—in fact, the security team doesn’t even have to operate any servers in this setup. Instead, they just act as code owners for the Terraform configurations and the CLI authentication Lambda \u0026amp; associated libraries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis project has leveled up our infrastructure defenses and inspired a number of new projects for the coming months. The team is working to apply similar methodologies to all of our application and infrastructure defenses—from detecting attacks in our corporate network, to identifying authorization vulnerabilities automatically in our primary web application.

We recently caught up with Figma\u0026#39;s VP of Product, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/yuhkiyam\"\u003eYuhki Yamashita\u003c/a\u003e, to hear what it was like to build FigJam and how things have changed since then. Here, he reflects on the evolving role of design and product management, what it means to welcome “non-designers” into the process, and the future of FigJam.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"9ac1218c5475\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTell me a little bit about what you do at Figma.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eI lead the product team here at Figma, which includes design, product management, and product research. We’re responsible for talking to our users, figuring out which problems to solve, and working with everyone in the company to generate and build the best solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTake us back to when Figma first launched FigJam. Why did the team build an online whiteboarding tool?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eWhen we’re thinking about where to take our product next, we actually take a lot of inspiration from our customers and the \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/explore\"\u003eFigma Community\u003c/a\u003e, to see how they’re stretching our product in interesting or unexpected ways. We saw this happening in the early days of the pandemic. Our users were starting to use Figma for everything from brainstorming ideas to running team warm-up activities, to even putting on social events for people to get to know each other. We saw a lot of use cases that got us thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, we were also transitioning to remote work ourselves and figuring out how to bring offline processes to an online format. There was something about just being in one (virtual) space together that felt like it was really hitting on some deep need that we all had. It validated what we had already observed from our users—that it was important to bring that experience into Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA big driver behind building FigJam was to help designers work with their extended teams. How have you seen design behavior change since you’ve been at Figma?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eDesign is opening up. Within design teams, people are riffing with each other more. And outside of design, more people across teams are jamming together, too. Whether it’s small copy tweaks or more fundamental changes, we’re seeing Figma and FigJam links being passed around the organization much earlier in the development process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think this speaks to a larger trend: that the boundary between engineering, design, and product management is blurring. Some of us used to have a mental model in which roles and responsibilities dictated how things work—that designers do one thing and engineers do another, for example. Increasingly, more people are crossing team lines to problem solve together. It has been validating to hear from our users (and Figmates!) that Figma encourages and facilitates that change in a way that makes everyone feel welcome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd how has the role of the PM changed?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eI think the PM and design roles have always had some overlap, but they didn’t always have the tools they needed to explore and collaborate together. I have worked on both design and product teams, so I’ve felt this firsthand. There used to be a sense that designs were sacred—it was kind of offensive when a PM came in and made a change or edited something, because it was the designer’s file. Now, it’s not about who “owns” what—it’s more of a collective endeavor. And the roles have become more interlocked, and I think that’s fundamentally a good thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs you think about pushing the design process forward, what’s top of mind?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eDesign is non-linear. At Figma, we often talk about “embracing the mess,” and that really means leaning into the chaos and complexity that makes the design process what it is. Even once you have the seedling of an idea, you need to explore and iterate, then pull back and evaluate to see what’s working and what’s not. Sometimes you’ll scrap an idea after a brainstorm session, and other times you’ll get pretty far with a concept, but still need different perspectives and input to move forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to have spaces that allow you to engage with the work from different altitudes—to both dive in and zoom out, at every part of the design process. With Figma and FigJam, we’re starting to see a lot more fluidity end to end, whether that’s in ideation and brainstorming, or design and development.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen would someone choose to use FigJam over Figma?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eFigJam is a great choice when things are a little more nebulous. Maybe you just want to throw around ideas, or get a temperature check for how people are feeling. You can do a lot of the generative brainstorming and mapping in FigJam, while Figma helps you start building towards an interface.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat’s your favorite feature, and how has it changed the way you work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eI love the expressiveness of FigJam. Previously, when I ran meetings, I’d circulate a shared doc and ask the team for agenda items. It felt polished and linear in a way that put the focus on project updates and milestones, instead of problem solving and unblocking together. With FigJam, it’s less about “meeting notes” and more about just being in the same space, together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also think that video conferencing creates frustrating dynamics—when you unmute, it feels like you need to declare that you have something to say. In FigJam, the cursor chats, emojis, and stickers are all ways that people can express themselves more naturally. The ephemeral nature of all of this is also very important—people just want to emulate a smile or a laugh without feeling like they need to leave a permanent imprint. There are so many human aspects of FigJam that I really like. More than anything, it can change the tone of the meeting, and generally how we work together. I think that’s really meaningful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat’s next?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003ePeople are using FigJam for all kinds of workshops and exercises, and there’s certainly more we can do to help people facilitate those activities better. For example, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1403021292463214595?s=20\"\u003ethe timer\u003c/a\u003e, which we recently launched, is a huge part of running a workshop. Moving forward, we’re asking ourselves how we can be there to make these activities as effective as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs ever, we want to lean even more into the Figma Community. Just as the community guided us to build FigJam, we’re excited to see the ways they continue to use FigJam. Whether they have ideas on how to run a great brainstorm, retrospective, or crit, or they’ve found a new way to use FigJam, I personally can’t wait to see what they come up with. And whatever that looks like, we want to make sure those resources are as easy to access as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"7c909887f06a\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/figjam/\"\u003eLearn more about FigJam\u003c/a\u003e and check out \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/figjam\"\u003etemplates from the Figma Community\u003c/a\u003e to get started.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

It seems that people are always asking what exactly a PM does, and for good reason: answers differ from company to company, where responsibilities and processes around product management vary widely. But one constant is that PMs sit at the center of product development, so the bulk of their work requires interfacing with various teams. Building fluency across these functions also requires knowing how to bring cross-functional partners into their work. At Figma, the PM experience is distinguished by a culture of trust, reflection, inclusion, and transparency—four things that help our PM team drive product development at Figma with an eye towards opening up their processes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?rect=0,0,2315,784\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=227\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"opening-up-to-ideas\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#opening-up-to-ideas\"\u003eOpening up to ideas\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Figma, we do a lot of \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/the-five-stages-of-an-effective-brainstorm/\"\u003ecross-functional brainstorms\u003c/a\u003e.

At a glance, vulnerability may not seem like a major priority for a high-level meeting among all of Figma’s PMs, but it’s the foundation of the meeting. When the team knows what someone’s dealing with at home, or whether a PM is particularly concerned about an aspect of a feature, they get a chance to address tough challenges head-on, lend a hand, or prevent those concerns from becoming blockers. And during a year out of office, the team wanted to devote time to this type of sharing to make up for chance office conversations, where these things come up naturally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"reflecting-together\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#reflecting-together\"\u003eReflecting together\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eRetrospectives, or \u003cem\u003eretros\u003c/em\u003e, are an intentional way to reflect back on a project or a period of time.

Although the common pattern is to retro every shipped product, the team has found stability in having retros at regular intervals, no matter where projects fall at the time. “I had my own experience with this—I felt really overwhelmed with all that was coming next, and I didn’t really promote a culture of reflection on my own PM team.

Designing solutions that everyone can use and access is a must-have, not nice-to-have. Early last year, Idean released \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/896347534161970744/Cards-for-Humanity\"\u003eCards for Humanity\u003c/a\u003e, a card game for introducing inclusive design in client workshops. Once the working world went remote, the team quickly moved the game online to make it more accessible, both as a \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/896347534161970744\"\u003eFigma plugin\u003c/a\u003e and as a \u003ca href=\"https://cardsforhumanity.idean.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"into-the-game\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#into-the-game\"\u003eInto the game\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe game features two kinds of cards: one set of cards shows a person’s name, age, and personality trait, while a second set includes a corresponding need, disability, or personal challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe game mechanic is simple: deal a pair of cards to create a character, then figure out how to meet their needs. Clicking a card reveals written considerations for listed traits, challenges, and disabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese considerations help curb any possible assumptions about different conditions and disabilities. The game’s open-ended style of play makes it a flexible tool for workshops, brainstorms, and casual conversations about accessibility and inclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy putting humans at the center of the design process, the cards solve one of the design industry’s key problems: “We found that it was really difficult to raise inclusive design in a way that was tangible to our clients,” explains Charlie. Designing inclusively doesn’t have to be difficult—it just starts with empathy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"designing-for-all\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#designing-for-all\"\u003eDesigning for all\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCards for Humanity required an inclusive and accessible design process from the jump. The team began their journey with internal research, asking each other if they\u0026#39;d be open to sharing their own traits and disabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext, they requested input from the online product community to craft a wider list of attributes. The game took off with a lot of momentum, which created some pressure as the team discovered changes they needed to make over time. “Making it as accessible as possible has been the most uphill challenge,” says Sidd. “An inclusivity and accessibility tool needs to itself be inclusive and accessible. We’ve done our best to listen to feedback and iterate on top of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFeedback is rich and varied, partly because the game’s audience was broader than they had initially anticipated. “When designing inclusive products, your audience might not be the audience you’re expecting,” says Eva. The team had expected strong reception among primarily designers and developers, but was surprised to hear from lawyers, gamers, clinicians, and educators who found it useful. “That just highlights how important it is to consider different audiences and how important it is to make it as accessible as possible through the use of language and avoiding jargon.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“When designing inclusive products, your audience might not be the audience you’re expecting.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"balancing-client-needs-with-internal-priorities\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#balancing-client-needs-with-internal-priorities\"\u003eBalancing client needs with internal priorities\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorking in a creative agency involves two types of work: external client work and internal projects that helps promote the business. Client work is billable, but internal work lacks a direct ROI. Even at Idean, where inclusion is a stated goal and a passion point for the team, there’s a natural tension between billable work and developing tools like Cards for Humanity. Considering the agency’s bottom line, it may seem obvious to focus narrowly on client work. But great product design \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e the bottom line. Building accessible and inclusive products is part of making better products, better outcomes, and happier clients. “Designing products and services that benefit everyone can only be, or should be, a business imperative, because those products and services can only impact and benefit more people,” Imogen says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn an individual level, balancing the work boils down to personal investment. “This is specific to the way things work within our team,” explains Charlie. “There’s been a blend of actually having time for it and people just doing it in their own time, which goes back to the team’s passion for creating tools like this.” And this investment has extended into client work as well. “We see this tool ingrained in our process and therefore ingrained in the work that our clients do,” adds Charlie. “If every client we work with uses this tool, the impact that could have among all the people they’re designing products for is absolutely massive. Seeing clients use it is amazing.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe conversation must move beyond profit and resources eventually, though. “Inclusive design is more than just a business case, a missed opportunity, or the right thing to do,” says Eva. “Inclusive design is about inclusion in society. It’s about thinking about the products that we generally design and their use. We as makers, designers, and developers have a responsibility, and we’re hoping that Cards for Humanity will highlight what’s important.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eInclusive design is more than just a business case, a missed opportunity, or the right thing to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbove all, Cards for Humanity is a way to begin the conversation with your team about accessibility and inclusion.

We \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-new-emea-hq/\"\u003eannounced our London hub\u003c/a\u003e last September, and today I’m excited to share that Figma’s newest hub is now live in New York City.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"work-that-works-for-you\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#work-that-works-for-you\"\u003eWork that works for you\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe past year and a half has taught us all many things.

In an internal survey from Q3 2020, we asked, \u0026#34;\u003cem\u003eIf Figma had the option for all roles to be remote, would you consider relocating to a non–Figma hub location before the end of 2022?\u0026#34;\u003c/em\u003e 68% of Figmates answered \u003cem\u003eyes\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003emaybe\u003c/em\u003e.

I was worried that I would feel isolated, but my direct team established a culture that encouraged asking for help—I learned that I could be on a Zoom for a quick consult within seconds of reaching out. More broadly, I also found that there are thoughtful structures in place to ensure that all remote employees have a meaningful experience—robust virtual onboarding sessions called \u003cem\u003eFigma Today\u003c/em\u003e, a fully online and globally-accessible \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-maker-week-more-than-a-hackathon/\"\u003eMaker Week\u003c/a\u003e, spaces to speak openly and honestly about \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-N2maCF840\"\u003ewhat has been hard\u003c/a\u003e, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile I’m confident that Figma has the right approach for me to work remotely indefinitely, I simply wanted to be in an office—I knew that being around coworkers in a shared space would be most fulfilling for me. The workplace team at Figma has designed our hubs with this spectrum of preferences in mind and I was intrigued by the way we reimagined the traditional office space.

Not only do publishing companies need to design and adapt for digital, their ability to create new content and evolve quickly determines their fate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.news.co.uk/\"\u003eNews UK\u003c/a\u003e, an arm of News Corp, grew their product offerings across print, online, radio, and TV to make sure that they were evolving with their customer base. This expansion meant scaling design and development across multiple brands and products. They needed a new design system to organize and manage the process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHistorically, the various brands—from \u003cem\u003eThe Times\u003c/em\u003e to \u003cem\u003eThe Sun\u003c/em\u003e—under News UK have operated completely independently, with separate design orgs, product teams, and even different tools. Uniting these brands under a single system—while adapting to each brand’s unique needs—would be a massive undertaking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Building a design system for all of our brands is challenging. We have a lot of brands with a lot of heritage, and they have tight requirements on how things should look and feel,” says Nick Dorman, Head of Design Systems at News UK. “As designers, it’s our job to understand what product, editorial, and marketing teams want from the design system; their perspectives influence how we approach building the system.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo start, the team tried to combine a number of design tools. But pairing Sketch, Abstract, Zeplin, and InVision ultimately resulted in a more disjointed solution. The design systems team would spend days—at times even weeks—trying to update and maintain their libraries. Even simple things like changing the color of text styles became a hassle as they ended up with thousands of styles just to accommodate all of the variants for each brand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlus, the theming features they had built to support the diverse, and growing, product and brand requirements became too rigid and complicated to use. When \u003cem\u003eThe Times\u003c/em\u003e moved into broadcasting with a new radio station, they became the first consumers of the design system and it became clear that the level of support needed from the design systems team would be unsustainable. Teams weren’t finding it easy to use the new system, and without widespread adoption, the design system couldn’t take off. They needed to rethink their approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this point, the team decided to migrate to Figma, with the goal of consolidating multiple tools, centralizing library management, and getting their teams to actually use and contribute to the system.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"encouraging-adoption\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#encouraging-adoption\"\u003eEncouraging adoption\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile a flexible design system is critical to scale, it’s just one part of the equation. Companies often overlook the cultural elements—team norms and processes, values, goals—required to make a design system successful. This was especially important to News UK. “It’s not enough to say, ‘here’s a new design system, please use it,’” says James Davis, Lead Designer. “People really want to understand it and feel they are involved, so we came up with creative ideas to educate and encourage adoption.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo help facilitate adoption of the design system, News UK’s design systems team individually set up every designer’s workspace in Figma and onboarded them. The team held tailored workshops and documentation on topics like migrating files from Sketch, structuring and managing files, and using components. Recognizing the importance of including cross-functional partners, they created documentation around how to comment, inspect, and integrate third party tools like Jira.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo encourage designers to contribute to the design system, the design systems team worked with them to produce component specs and reusable design patterns that they could share across the organization. They even created \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/990170554808116110\"\u003etools in Figma\u003c/a\u003e to offer guidance on which components to use in a particular scenario, like how to onboard users to a new product or feature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?rect=0,0,1599,1024\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=429\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe prototype tool that the News UK team created in Figma\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, the team recruited a number of designer advocates to promote the design system within the company, improve adoption by sharing best practices, and serve as the main point of contact for the design systems team.

When the team introduced Figma as a replacement for Sketch, Abstract, and the other tools, they went from being burdened by the design system to feeling like it supported their work and made them more efficient.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There was a night and day difference after we transitioned to Figma,” Davis says. “Designers saw the potential of the tool and wanted to understand more about it. It acted as a catalyst for building out our design system.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter migrating to Figma in just a couple of weeks, News UK now has a design system that flexes to all their brands’ needs. One of the team’s favorite functionalities is the ability to apply different themes to the same components. “We developed a plugin that enables us to experiment and more easily build out individual components that work across multiple brands,” Dorman says. “It also makes the design system feel like it was purpose-built for the brand.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eNews UK\u0026#39;s custom-built Themer plugin in action\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeams can now collaborate and get feedback on their work earlier and more frequently, saving time down the line. “It’s more important than ever that we avoid working in isolation, we need to operate as one team, share knowledge, support each other, and stop reinventing existing solutions,” says Dorman. “Our new design system helps us work in a more interconnected way.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the new multi-brand design system rolled out to all News UK product and design teams, the feedback Dorman and Davis have received is beyond what they had expected. “Every quarter or so, we send out an internal NPS survey to the teams to gather feedback about the design system,” Dorman says. “We saw a 23-point spike in our NPS score in the first quarter following our introduction of Figma–our most significant bounce to date. There’s still more work to be done, but product teams are now buying into the system and reporting real benefits.

(Meta.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePreviously, the Figma research team used spreadsheets to track product feedback from Figma users. If a Figmate had questions about a piece of feedback, they would have to leave a comment on its cell in the spreadsheet. Beyond being difficult to manage, the process made it nearly impossible to draw group insights outside of synchronous conversation, leading to long meetings and tons of spreadsheet searching. With FigJam, Vanessa and the research team can not only track user input, but also create a space for cross-functional partners to comment, ask questions, and engage more deeply with the material.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=450\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA matrix created by Ollie Ronaldson of The Value Engineers\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbove is one of multiple matrix templates Vanessa and the research team use.

In a recent retrospective including engineering, design, and product management, Engineer Karl Jiang noted that FigJam creates a low barrier to entry for people who are shy about giving feedback. This is the real power of FigJam stickies—auto-labeling provides an advantage for widespread teams with varied levels of verbal participation: in FigJam, everyone\u0026#39;s contributions are automatically visible from a quick scan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is easy to find yourself in the weeds in a retro, so the FigJam timer comes in handy for facilitators who want to keep retros moving at a steady pace.

I didn’t know how to fix it.” At first, Shanique took the setback personally. Once she took a break from the project, she gained a new perspective that allowed her to see the project as a learning experience. “I realized that maybe I was too close to my work and I needed to take a step back,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShanique came away with four tips after reflecting on the experience:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt’s not about you\u003c/strong\u003e - Instead of taking things personally, remember that feedback is likely not a reflection on you or the quality of your work.

Beyond looking for inspiration, we know that many (us included!) come to Config to learn. Whether your team is just starting out or gearing up for rapid growth, process is top of mind. Here is a look at the tactics, systems, and best practices that keep the design teams at Coda and Stripe running.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"balancing-intuition-and-insights\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#balancing-intuition-and-insights\"\u003eBalancing intuition and insights\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://config.figma.com/speakers/helena-jaramillo/\"\u003eHelena Jaramillo\u003c/a\u003e joined the design team at Coda just as they set out to build a publishing platform, with the goal of allowing users to share best practices and discover documents. Unlike past projects that were focused on redesigning or optimizing an existing product, Helena was tasked with building something from scratch. Going from 0 to 1 can be tough. For Helena, it’s all about cultivating expertise so you can rally your team around a shared vision, even when you’re just getting started.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"build-context\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#build-context\"\u003eBuild context\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn previous projects, Helena had been able to leverage data to support her efforts. Since she and the team at Coda were building something from the ground up, she didn’t have the benefit of context and insights. “You don\u0026#39;t have existing users’ behavior, you don\u0026#39;t even have users that you can interview for research,” Helena says. To fill in those gaps, Helena researched competitors and products in adjacent spaces. She annotated screenshots in a Figma file, sharing inspiration, and pointing out approaches that may not be a fit for Coda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"develop-a-strong-perspective\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#develop-a-strong-perspective\"\u003eDevelop a strong perspective\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo rally the team around building a publishing platform, Helena knew it was important to have a clear vision. First, she asked questions to articulate why people would publish on Coda, and what Coda could uniquely bring to the table: “Was publishing on Coda going to feel more like publishing a blog post? Or was it going to feel more like publishing a no-code app? Or was it going to feel more like publishing a website?” she asks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo answer these questions, Helena called on her own experience as a publisher, and bounced around ideas with her team to see what would resonate. They arrived on two priorities: make the process easy, and ensure that publishers would be proud of their work. These priorities resulted in product decisions—a flow that made it easy to publish interactive docs, and the ability to add a photo, subtitle, and byline so that publishers could take credit for their work. In the absence of existing user insights, they trusted each other’s instincts and built a strong POV as a team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"tell-the-broader-story\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#tell-the-broader-story\"\u003eTell the broader story\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Helena shared her insights and vision with the Coda product team, it wasn’t just about aligning on the right features and functionality—she wanted to tell a story. She created a “tl;dr page” in Figma to get her cross-functional partners on board, showing a flow with a handful of mockups that effectively narrated what they were building. “The tl;dr page was helpful for when someone wanted to understand what I was doing but didn’t have all the details,” says Helena. It wasn’t meant to explain how all the features worked, but simply show the story we were trying to create.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"solving-short-term-needs-while-building-for-scale\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#solving-short-term-needs-while-building-for-scale\"\u003eSolving short-term needs while building for scale\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://config.figma.com/speakers/connie-yang/\"\u003eConnie Yang\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://config.figma.com/speakers/tayler-aitken/\"\u003eTayler Atiken\u003c/a\u003e, and the rest of the design team at Stripe endeavor to make complex processes as simple and easy as possible for businesses and end users alike. The team operates on four main principles, which inform their processes, tactics, and systems:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"think-in-really-long-time-scales\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#think-in-really-long-time-scales\"\u003eThink in really long time scales\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eConnie calls this a “city planner mentality.” “We\u0026#39;re not thinking about how we build individual buildings or cars, but we\u0026#39;re thinking about questions like: how wide should the streets be? Where and how should traffic flow? What connects to what? How do we prepare for fires and disasters?” she says. Ultimately, the team asks themselves, “How do we move with urgency and focus while also building for the year 2030?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"lay-strong-foundations\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#lay-strong-foundations\"\u003eLay strong foundations\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eEstablishing the right infrastructure and processes is key to that forward-looking approach. “Solid foundations means things like making sure we build products and platforms that are fast and accessible. It means we invest in the creation of systems that scale rather than short-sighted fixes,” Connie says. For example, the color system tables in Stripe’s design system have built-in contrast and accessibility ratings. The result is a stronger structure for the team to build on, and a better experience for Stripe’s users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"prioritize-rigor-and-quality\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#prioritize-rigor-and-quality\"\u003ePrioritize rigor and quality\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Stripe, Connie says, “Details matter.” Since businesses use Stripe to accept payments and send payouts, user trust is top of mind. This means building things that are a little harder, but ultimately make the experience better for the user. “A user interface that is perfectly polished and works exactly as you would expect is critical to earning and keeping the trust of our customers,” says Connie.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"inspire-confidence\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#inspire-confidence\"\u003eInspire confidence\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe team at Stripe deals with technical infrastructure that has to be both compliant and easy to use, so the work can get complex. Rather than over-simplifying concepts, one of Stripe’s guiding principles is to talk “up” to users, while helping them through challenging situations. “We are the primary, and often only, source of revenue for most of our customers,\u0026#34; says Connie. And that means a lot of actions they try to take can be really scary. If something goes wrong, there can be serious consequences.\u0026#34; \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, dealing with a disputed charge can be tricky for a merchant. In Stripe, the merchant will see helpful tips, informing them of what to expect in a clear and straightforward way. “We guide users towards specific solutions and try to lighten their cognitive load so they can get their work done,” says Connie.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"6c66fe4a52c3\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it can take some time to figure out the right processes and systems, investing in them now will provide a strong foundation that grows and evolves with you—whatever that looks like for you and your team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’d like to hear more tactical tips Config 2021, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx68R0B8tettMfY6XeItWhV4\"\u003ewatch all the sessions on YouTube\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

In our weekly All Hands meetings—affectionately called FigNation—we invite new Figmates to share how they’re a maker. When I first started, I was intimidated by this idea. I never considered myself a maker—I’m really more of a \u003cem\u003ecurator\u003c/em\u003e than a \u003cem\u003ecreator\u003c/em\u003e. But I quickly learned that being a maker is less about identifying as an artist or craftsperson, and more about expressing our creativity in whatever way feels authentic to each of us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"enter-maker-week\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#enter-maker-week\"\u003eEnter: Maker Week\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwice a year, Figmates are invited to pause day-to-day work and come together for a week of innovation and connection. Our take on a cross-functional hackathon, Maker Week is an opportunity to take a step back and live our \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/careers/\"\u003evalues\u003c/a\u003e—thinking big and bold ideas, connecting with one another, and putting our individual stamps on the business, community, and culture we\u0026#39;re collectively building.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHackathons are a pretty common way for engineering, product, and design teams to come together and jam on ideas or projects that haven’t been prioritized. The problem is that they can sometimes feel exclusive to non-technical teams. For me, the magic of Maker Week is that Figmates across teams, product areas, and time zones are invited to participate in what feels more like a maker festival. Technical expertise isn’t a prerequisite, and the result is more cross-pollination of ideas, shared ownership in what we’re creating, and a better understanding of the role we each play in building Figma. In the past, recruiters have made employee baseball cards to share with candidates looking to learn more about their prospective teams, interns built a Name That Figmate game to help us all get to know one another, and data scientists taught chemistry fundamentals with a baking lesson.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince 2018, we’ve hosted five Maker Weeks, resulting in hundreds of projects. And, we’ve shipped many of these externally, from core product features like \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/\"\u003eauto layout\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061175334-Create-interactive-components-with-variants\"\u003einteractive components\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-plugins/\"\u003eplugins\u003c/a\u003e to others that provide a peek into our culture, like \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHXmj3hN5mI\"\u003eFigma in Quarantine: The Musical\u003c/a\u003e.

As a company, we rely on these projects every day in how we operate, engage with our community, and plan for the future.

By the end of this week, we’ll have an even longer list of exciting things to build.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday marks the beginning of Maker Week #6 and we’re approaching this one a bit differently. Rather than anchoring around one theme, as we have in the past, we’ll be working (and celebrating, of course) within four “Frames”: Exploring, Refining, Learning, and Connecting. Where a theme is designed to spark inspiration beyond how we typically operate, Frames aim to expand accessibility and loosely anchor the work to our values. The hope is that they give Figmates—no matter their tenure or technical ability—the opening to make something great, together. And while one of the main pillars of Maker Week is to work across teams, we realize that many Figmates will continue supporting our users, ensuring high performance, and keeping our infrastructure sound.

Here is a look at how they created cultures that foster transparency and trust.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"embracing-vulnerability\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#embracing-vulnerability\"\u003eEmbracing vulnerability\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor many of us over the past year, the gap between work lives and personal lives narrowed. In her talk, Figma researcher \u003ca href=\"https://config.figma.com/speakers/nannearl-brown/\"\u003eNannearl Brown\u003c/a\u003e shares how she and the research team navigated a year full of hardship. For Nannearl, being open about how you’re feeling and what you need is the key to creating a supportive team culture. “Even when it’s hard,” she says, “I\u0026#39;ve found that being honest is more worthwhile than not.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to checking in on each other in 1:1s and throughout the day, the team created a routine around daily stand-ups. In their shared Slack channel, each researcher shares a list of focus areas for the day. As part of their update, they’re prompted to talk about what they’re doing that day to give them energy beyond work—whether that’s exercise, a hobby or spending time with family. Nannearl says that it keeps the team accountable to do things outside of work, while allowing them to get to know each other better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, it all comes down to being a supportive teammate to one another: “It’s not enough to be present enough to listen to them–I also need to make space for their emotions, their experiences, and their thoughts.” Sometimes that means acknowledging the difficult moments. “We don\u0026#39;t have to be okay all the time.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"creating-inclusive-spaces\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#creating-inclusive-spaces\"\u003eCreating inclusive spaces\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor \u003ca href=\"https://config.figma.com/speakers/johns-beharry/\"\u003eJohns Beharry\u003c/a\u003e, Bitcoin Designer at Peak Shift, and \u003ca href=\"https://config.figma.com/speakers/christoph-ono/\"\u003eChristoph Ono\u003c/a\u003e, Bitcoin Designer at GBKS, shared tools and resources are central to building community. After hearing feedback from designers looking to enter the Bitcoin world, Johns and Christoph realized that Bitcoin design might be alienating to those without technical expertise. To Johns, this seemed contradictory to the ethos of Bitcoin, which he says is all about opening up access: “As Bitcoin\u0026#39;s popularity continues to grow, it\u0026#39;s essential that everyone\u0026#39;s able to participate in this new economy, regardless of their technical expertise or geography, because people have a real need for it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo Johns and Christoph, the solution was all about creating shared spaces—starting with a \u003ca href=\"https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-gytq2snl-4TEWJOTKrXRCB4YLBoDunA#/\"\u003eSlack group\u003c/a\u003e—that allow designers new to the Bitcoin world to learn from more experienced designers. From there, it evolved across channels, from \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/bitcoindesign\"\u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e, to a \u003ca href=\"https://bitcoin.design/\"\u003eresource hub\u003c/a\u003e, to weekly community calls in which designers can share early work and discuss challenges. They also created the \u003ca href=\"https://bitcoin.design/guide/\"\u003eBitcoin Design Guide\u003c/a\u003e, an open source repository with learnings and best practices. Building an inclusive resource was top of mind—making it applicable across cultures, regions, geographies, and languages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore than anything, says Johns, the goal was to create a “friendly space” that opens up the conversation and invites more diverse perspectives and backgrounds. “When we join with other people and add more people to the design process, we can get those other perspectives that can help us design more inclusive experiences and more accessible experiences,” says Johns. “We can’t do it alone.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"8b21e9179670\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWatch (or re-watch!) all of the talks from day one \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx68R0B8tettMfY6XeItWhV4\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.

Today, we’re introducing branching in beta to better enable collaboration at scale.

Product Manager Meagan Gamache shares a peek into the 13-month journey to beta and what this means for design system management in Figma.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"0a723f18ebbc\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Figma CEO Dylan Field \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4g-oZ6mFIc\"\u003eshared at Config\u003c/a\u003e, design is never a solo act. Rather, it’s bringing together each individual’s unique skillsets—the sum of several efforts. That’s why we’re making it even easier for design teams to come together in Figma. With branching, designers can collaborate freely on shared files, while protecting them from unapproved or unintentional changes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-good-problem\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-good-problem\"\u003eThe (good) problem\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike always, our journey to beta started with the needs of our users, who told us that their design systems were decentralized across multiple teams and platforms. The upside was that they were using design systems, instead of repeatedly building similar components from scratch. And, designers were able to reuse components and work faster and more efficiently. The downside was that these design systems were located in different places, resulting in inconsistencies and requiring designers to break flow between tools.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesign teams needed a way to centralize their design systems while protecting and maintaining them at scale. Let’s take the \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/v4g-oZ6mFIc?t=224\"\u003eNetflix Hawkins system\u003c/a\u003e, for example. There are over 100 designers that both contribute to and rely on it. With that many contributors, the most recent updates to a file may not always be what’s approved for use. We needed to make space in the product for designers to be inspired and explore new ideas and iterations without auto-saving to shared files. So, we began thinking through ways to bring the branch-merge workflow into Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"first-principles-first\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#first-principles-first\"\u003eFirst principles first\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe started by asking ourselves: How can we create a sandbox in Figma without creating more complexity for our users?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCommits felt like extra work. Branches of branches felt complex. So, we decided to revisit fundamental assumptions and take a renewed approach. We landed on two principles: simplicity and consistency. This meant branching needed to be built into the product holistically, prompting us to make branching work within the multiplayer experience. As a result, branches have all of the same multiplayer perks as other Figma files. There is no need for extra actions like committing, because the work on branches is auto-saved. Today, you can create a branch from any file to safely explore new ideas and, when ready, editors can merge updates into the main file.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we continue to add features, like reviews, we’re also exploring how versioning works across the entire platform.

Design, once on the periphery, \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/the-rise-of-ux-ui-design-a-decade-in-reflection/\"\u003ehas moved closer to center stage\u003c/a\u003e. Collaboration is in; silos are out. And as if anyone needed reminding, many of us—me and my Figmates very much included—\u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/by-the-numbers-one-year-of-remote-work/\"\u003ehave been working remotely for over a year\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat this all adds up to is less time spent together in person and more time spent in online spaces like Figma, which we’ve seen people use in all kinds of creative and unexpected ways—from \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/749261072790710247\"\u003emultiplayer pong\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/781201547686744476\"\u003eice breakers\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/tsantsai/status/1382010578655383554\"\u003emeal planning\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/821550158119537264\"\u003ebrainstorming\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn each of these use cases, pixels aren\u0026#39;t being pushed. Products aren\u0026#39;t being designed. People are simply looking for a space to share ideas and connect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe can empathize—our team has been working from home, too. So it became clear to us early on, especially after what felt like our zillionth video call, that there’s something special about simply “being” in Figma together—that beyond a powerful interface design tool, Figma can serve as an \u003cem\u003eenergizing\u003c/em\u003e space for people across teams and geographies to come together, iterate and explore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith this insight in hand, we kicked off an exploration of our own into whether we could make Figma a more inviting place for these types of free-form interactions. If we could do that, we figured, we could also bring more people into the earliest stages of design. After all, Figma’s vision is to make design accessible to everyone. Here was a chance to take the next step.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut after digging a bit further, we realized that these interactions needed their own dedicated space—one where anyone felt welcome and designers felt at home, so everyone could feel comfortable jumping in and sharing ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"figjam-where-the-best-product-ideas-begin\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#figjam-where-the-best-product-ideas-begin\"\u003eFigJam: Where the best product ideas begin\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s why we built FigJam, an online whiteboard made for designers to ideate and brainstorm with their extended teams. Think of it as a lightweight version of Figma that’s easier to learn and even more fun to use. It’s for defining user problems, looking for inspiration, and exploring ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a ton of functionality built into FigJam that makes it a great space for early-stage design thinking. In multiplayer, teams can use sticky-notes, emojis and drawing tools to brainstorm. In single-player, systems thinkers can use shapes and pre-built lines and connectors to map user flows and build new processes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?rect=0,0,1599,907\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=380\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eDiagramming in FigJam is easy with shapes and pre-built lines and connectors.

Repsol, Spain’s largest multi-energy company, was the first company of its kind to commit to being carbon zero by 2050. Design was central to this shift.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;Design helps us create digital products adapted to the needs of our clients and employees. The impact is not in making things more beautiful, but in enabling Repsol to stay relevant and to fulfill the needs and expectations of our clients.\u0026#34; says Valero Marin, CIO/CDO.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThree years ago, Repsol didn’t have a digital design team. Today, ten designers work to redefine how customers and consumers interact with energy, and they’re one of the first internal design teams at any European energy company. For these designers to be successful, the Repsol team needed to define the role design can play at Repsol and build the teams, tools, and processes necessary to make design scale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRepsol partnered with Mendesaltaren, a digital product agency, to implement a design system in Figma. The result is not only a more collaborative and consistent approach to design, but also a measurable one. With this backdrop, designers at Repsol have begun to make energy more approachable for consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“As designers at Repsol, our role is to move everyone into a new reality where energy is tangible and relatable,” says Cristina Gonzalez Bermejo, Lead UX \u0026amp; Design Hub, at Repsol.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"rethinking-how-consumers-interact-with-energy\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#rethinking-how-consumers-interact-with-energy\"\u003eRethinking how consumers interact with energy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr/\u003eOnce executives at Repsol made a promise to reach zero emissions by 2050, the work began immediately. As part of this shift, Repsol knew that the average consumer doesn’t have a deep understanding of how energy is created or consumed. It begged the question: how do you design for something that no one has actually interacted with before?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=377\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eRepsol’s updated designs that make energy more approachable to consumers\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The energy transition will only happen if people stop seeing energy as a necessary evil, and start seeing themselves as change agents,” Cristina says. “In that context, the role of design is key.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe mission of Repsol’s design team is to humanize energy, make people care about it, and help individuals dedicate time to understanding how they can better consume energy. Recently, the team designed an app for an electric car-sharing service that shows consumers how much energy they use when they’re driving. Customers then received a rating based on how they drive, helping them understand how to drive more efficiently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe team also wants to help make energy into something visual and relatable, so design is top of mind. The design team recently added functionality that shows where energy originates. In the app, a user can see in real-time the solar panels or windmills that generate their electricity, in context of the current weather conditions. In the past, a user would simply get a bill. Now they have the opportunity to visualize and interact with their energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?rect=0,0,2560,1437\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=376\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe app where consumers can select the source of their electricity and see live the conditions under which it is being generated\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-solid-foundation\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-solid-foundation\"\u003eA solid foundation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eRepsol serves many different audiences: those at the gas pump, workers making energy decisions for a factory, and its own employees who use digital tools to make the operation of oil rigs, refineries, or supply chains safer and more efficient. “But,” as Cristina says, “there’s one Repsol, so there should be one unique design system.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesign Strategist Andra Oprișan echoes that sentiment. “We realized that we were teaching users ten different interaction languages in ten different products.” Beyond simplifying the process, they needed to make it easier for people to adopt the tools they create. By partnering with Mendesaltaren and Figma, the team at Repsol built the Oxygen design system. In doing so, they cracked the code on creating one design experience for different products that serve different purposes for different audiences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe main goal of Repsol’s Oxygen design system—which is built in Figma—is to create cohesion across the Repsol digital product ecosystem, while also making the product development process more efficient.

With these updates, they’ve saved time and resources, all while simplifying the decision-making process. \u0026#34;Thanks to the new design system and plugins implemented to track performance and versions, Repsol can now easily track how much money, time, and effort they’re saving ” says Jorge Lana, partner \u0026amp; CSO at Mendesaltaren.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8cbcda3576ce4d84a8eda76edd6cc828e07a1e3d-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=377\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8cbcda3576ce4d84a8eda76edd6cc828e07a1e3d-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8cbcda3576ce4d84a8eda76edd6cc828e07a1e3d-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8cbcda3576ce4d84a8eda76edd6cc828e07a1e3d-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8cbcda3576ce4d84a8eda76edd6cc828e07a1e3d-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8cbcda3576ce4d84a8eda76edd6cc828e07a1e3d-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA look at how the team measures the success and impact of their designs\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Repsol works towards becoming a net zero carbon company, time saved is time that can be used to change how the world thinks about energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"01323be3797a\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eCheck out \u003ca href=\"https://digitalsystem.repsol.com/\"\u003eRepsol’s design system and Figma libraries\u003c/a\u003e to learn more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

But once we actually mapped out what this new paradigm might look like, we quickly realized that the “one user, one account” model was baked into the file browser UI, not just the technical infrastructure. If we were to add on support for multiple accounts based on the previous version of the file browser, the UI would be clunky, at best—not to mention the broader under-the-hood technical challenges. To accommodate a new account switching feature, we’d have to re-examine the whole information architecture (IA) of the file browser.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, we needed to arrive on a long-term direction of the file browser, while also making changes to address user feedback in the short-term.

A hybrid model, allowing users to access multiple workspaces in the Figma editor, while maintaining one single Figma Community profile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we thought about how to build this, we needed to be conscious of what it looks and feels like to go from one single identity (the Figma Community) to multiple identities (the Figma editor).

To build the best Figma kit possible, we had to flip the typical workflow, and have the final code product inform the design files as a pixel-perfect standard to match.

I established naming conventions and labeled everything accordingly, making sure I was staying consistent throughout. In Figma, consistent naming also allows for overrides to carry over when swapping instances or changing variants of a component. For example, a \u0026#34;button\u0026#34; component has a simple text layer named \u0026#34;Text.\u0026#34; If I change my button to a larger size variant, the custom text I create carries over.

Here, Growth Data Scientist Wendy Lu shares how an experiment to enable remote collaboration kicked off a larger workstream to understand changes in collaboration more broadly. We found that users are collaborating more across regions and time zones, designers are working more closely with their cross-functional colleagues, and people are starting to include collaborators earlier in the design process. Below, read more on our findings (and methodology), and see how these trends come to life at Atlassian and Dropbox.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"wacKgXXD5Z8u\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Figma, the data science team follows an embedded model, allowing us to have functional expertise and feel like one unit, while also going deep on specific product areas and building domain knowledge. I’m embedded on the growth team, whose goal is to test which features and experiences will deliver the most value to our users.

This projected increase in collaboration would mean that templates facilitate remote work, potentially easing some of the pain points we heard from users (and experienced ourselves!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe growth team quickly built a “template picker,” allowing users to create new files from blank presets or templates designed for remote work use cases. We ran an experiment with a portion of our existing user base, serving the template picker to users in the experiment treatment group. The goal was to see whether—and how—teams would use these templates, and the resulting impact on collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=377\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe template picker we used in the experiment\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"our-learnings\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#our-learnings\"\u003eOur learnings\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe found that users who received the template picker had a 5% higher rate of collaboration, measured as % of users making edits or comments in a shared file. Additionally, we observed that users discovered new features through the template picker—10% more users discovered frame presets, and 90% more users leveraged files from the Figma Community in their file creation process. And, this remained true across designers and their cross-functional colleagues—the most popular files include both design-centric use cases (think: remote design sprints) and broader applications like whiteboarding and team-building activities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though the experiment was run on a portion of our user base, it didn’t go unnoticed.

Among professional teams and organizations, the ratio of designers to non-designers grew from February 2020 to February 2021, meaning that there were 25% more non-designers for every designer in a team. As the need for asynchronous communication grows, designers are inviting more view-only collaborators to their files for real-time feedback. This trend is reflected in both a growing number of file shares between designers and their cross-functional colleagues (+140%), as well as an increasing editor-to-viewer ratio (+12%) within the last year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"within-the-design-process\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#within-the-design-process\"\u003eWithin the design process\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to more non-designers and viewers engaging in a more collaborative design process, we also observed that more teams started collaborating in Figma earlier in the file lifecycle.

After duplicating the file, I realized that the prototype’s starting frame was set incorrectly. I wanted to offer this feedback (and share how much I loved the resource!), but I wasn’t sure how to get in touch. After some digging, I found a personal website and Twitter account that finally led me to the creator’s email address. In hindsight, had I not been an \u003cem\u003eavid Figma Community user\u003c/em\u003e (or an engineer on the product), I might not have gone through the hoops to find a way to communicate with the file creator. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/bringing-the-community-together-in-figma/\"\u003efirst announced the Figma Community\u003c/a\u003e, we were excited to bring the hundreds of thousands of Figma users together in our product to share, learn, and connect. But it’s not just about searching for resources and deciding whether you want to install a plugin or duplicate a file. If the goal was to connect users, we needed to facilitate a deeper level of engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo do that involved introducing a new paradigm of what interacting in the Figma Community could look like. Our vision was to enable two types of comments: general comments—which show up as a feed below the file—or contextual comments, which follow the existing in-editor commenting design of attaching notes to a specific place in the file itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"old-meets-new\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#old-meets-new\"\u003eOld meets new\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we first started working on bringing comments into the Figma Community, I thought it would simply be a matter of layering the existing comments interface and code onto the file preview, with maybe a couple lines of code changed here or there. As with any code-repurposing project, there were a couple of technical hiccups: we had to replace the previous iframe file preview to support viewport information communication, and consider the performance implications of a potentially large number of comments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSurprisingly, one of the largest wrenches in the development process was less about the technical challenges and more about the back-and-forth feedback cycle on minute interaction details. This really uncovered how \u003cem\u003edifferent\u003c/em\u003e interactions had to be to make them \u003cem\u003eseem the same\u003c/em\u003e as the in-editor commenting we were trying to port over.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA lot of this boiled down to the fact that we were turning a one-way alleyway into a two-way street, with no clear guidelines on how to tunnel traffic into the new direction provided. In other words, we were providing a new avenue of audience-to-creator communication on a platform that was mostly creator-to-audience, via published resources. Beyond that, we were breaking the generally linear paradigm of comments, often thought of as a feed of questions and input. With contextual comments, we needed to think more spatially, specifically about how a comment would anchor to a point on the design while still allowing users to view and pan across the canvas. Top of mind was arriving on the best experience to encourage the audience to leave comments on files, without degrading the existing view-only experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"initial-explorations\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#initial-explorations\"\u003eInitial explorations\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the whole development process, we formed a tight feedback loop between engineering, design, and product, as we scoped out how to best modify the file viewing real estate to support contextual comment creation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur designer, \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/explore-the-figma-community/\"\u003eHeather Tompkins\u003c/a\u003e, and design intern \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jemmakwak\"\u003eJemma Kwak\u003c/a\u003e kicked things off by exploring a wide array of options for what commenting in the Figma Community could look like. Since the experience inherently required a lot of user interactions, many of these mocks weren’t the usual static wireframes that most projects were built off of. Instead, we relied on gifs demonstrating how the viewing experience might be altered to account for comments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSidebar comments feed exploration by Jemma Kwak, a design intern\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe group generated a lot of great ideas, including places to embed a new comments feed, as well as ways for the user to interact with the canvas preview to better view comments. With such detailed prototypes available, we were quickly able to scope out and narrow down the product behavior based on technical feasibility, UI edge cases, and the general product timeline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eOne of many mini-viewer explorations by designer Heather Tompkins\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the process of this exploration phase, we revisited inputs from the product, engineering, and design sides, and prioritized the ones we deemed essential for the initial launch. In turn, we decided that we wanted to:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eBring the users into the commenting experience as quickly and easily as possible, to encourage users to browse and use this method of communication\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDisplay contextual comments in a space large enough to really analyze and understand the file location the comment was placed in\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eArrive at a solution that was technically feasible, within our timeline, and not overly-complex\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith these goals and constraints in mind, we decided that contextual comments would appear only in the fullscreen view, where there would be enough screen real estate to view the relevant context. To bring the user closer to the comments-viewing experience, we opted to have the viewer expand to fullscreen mode upon clicking on the canvas; clicking and panning would be disabled on the minimized canvas view, to encourage viewing the file in fullscreen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePrototype of full-window file preview experience\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"back-to-the-drawing-board\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#back-to-the-drawing-board\"\u003eBack to the drawing board\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we had mostly built out the commenting experience, the team got together for a routine bug bash, during which we test out the feature to catch hidden bugs. By this point in the development process, we usually catch a couple small bugs (think: misaligned text, broken buttons, or edge cases) that cause the feature to break. This time, we realized that there was a bigger problem—the UX felt a little awkward and clunky, so we needed to spend more time on refining the experience. After putting our heads together, we identified the specific UX issues and came up with approaches to fixing them:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"no-exit\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#no-exit\"\u003eNo exit\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first one was that the current design made it too simple to enter fullscreen mode, but too hard to exit. In an effort to make the commenting experience easier to access, we decided that any click on the canvas expand to a fullscreen view. However, this meant that users who accidentally clicked on the canvas—or those who were used to exploring on the smaller preview size—would be forced into a view where the only escape was a small “collapse” button in the upper right corner. The ease of entering and the lack-of-ease for exiting created a “trapping” experience for those using it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo address this, we played with a couple of options to decrease the extent this larger preview dominated the screen. We tried switching from a fullscreen experience (where the page would takeover the entire desktop) to a full-window experience (taking up the browser window, but still giving user control over the page). In the end, we went with a modal solution brought up by \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jesszwang\"\u003eJessica Wang\u003c/a\u003e, another engineer on the comments project. We took inspiration from the lightboxes from photo-sharing websites, reusing the expected enter-and-exiting behavior that this design pattern afforded. We also brought back the drag-to-pan functionality on the minimized view, allowing users who did prefer to navigate that way to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe new in-modal expanded preview experience\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"feed-vs-preview\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#feed-vs-preview\"\u003eFeed vs. preview\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother issue that we identified was a disconnect between contextual comments in the feed versus in the file preview. While one way to explore contextual comments was through the fullscreen preview mode, another was in the general feed below the file preview. There, contextual comments were mixed in with the non-contextual comments, and clicking on a contextual comment would bring the user up to the top of the page, to view the comment in the preview.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe realized that this behavior could be unexpected, because we didn’t differentiate between the two types of comments enough in the UI, and it wasn’t clear whether or not the scrolling action would occur after clicking on a comment. Additionally, after the user was brought to the top, they would have no way of returning to their previous spot, aside from manually scrolling back down. This meant that if a user unintentionally clicked on a contextual comment, they’d be thrown into a completely different part of the page—with no clear way to get back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo solve this, we added more visual indicators for contextual comments, like a pin icon next to the commenter avatar and a “See in context” blurb to indicate the scroll-to-top behavior. We also built a “back” button that appeared after scrolling to the top, allowing the users to easily return to their location on the feed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eExample of the \u0026#34;scroll back\u0026#34; button to navigate back to the general feed\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"fun-implementations-along-the-way\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fun-implementations-along-the-way\"\u003eFun implementations along the way\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThroughout the development process, there were a lot of fun, animation-related problems that greatly improved the experience and overall polish of the final feature. Here are a couple that I found particularly fun and interesting to work on:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen clicking through comments on the sidebar in the expanded view, the default experience is to “jump” between the different locations, with no transitions whatsoever. While this experience worked for in-editor comments, this sudden jump was flagged as slightly jarring in the Figma Community, especially as users were navigating files that they were unfamiliar with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn order to support a smooth pan between two different locations on the canvas, I had to modify viewer code directly, which is the same system used to show prototypes in Figma. Fortunately, most of the logic for interpolation between positions was already built-in, so my job was mainly surfacing animation and timing parameters to the viewer’s typescript interface. While it was a small code change, it was my first time dipping my toes in this part of the codebase and writing Skew code, which is the language that our viewer is built in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe preview now pans smoothly between comment locations on the file preview\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"expanding-hover-effect-on-the-file-preview\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#expanding-hover-effect-on-the-file-preview\"\u003eExpanding hover effect on the file preview\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo better indicate that clicking on the file preview would open the user up to an expanded modal, we added a slight expanding animation when the user hovered over the file preview. The most straightforward approach to this—adding to the height and width of the container element on hover—didn’t work in this case. Since the viewer re-renders when its viewport or size of the containing elements changes, the simple six-pixel expansion became choppy as the browser kept recomputing the viewer canvas for this hover effect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution was to flip our thinking on its head: instead of having a smaller default state and expanding on hover, the viewer container would always have the height and width of the expanded state. We then created a separate element that was placed over the canvas, with a border that masked the edges of the viewer to make the canvas seem like the minimized size. When hovering, instead of increasing the size of the canvas, we decreased the border width of the overlaid mask, revealing the edges of the viewer that were previously hidden and creating the illusion of expansion when hovering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe file preview expands slightly when hovering over it\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"animating-between-the-default-and-expanded-modal\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#animating-between-the-default-and-expanded-modal\"\u003eAnimating between the default and expanded modal file preview\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the user clicks on the file preview, we animate it from its default state to a modal state. While the change in size is not that difficult to animate, the part that was difficult was animating between two different types of positioning placement, \u003ccode\u003eposition: absolute\u003c/code\u003e to \u003ccode\u003eposition: fixed\u003c/code\u003e. The \u003ccode\u003eposition\u003c/code\u003e CSS attribute determines how the coordinate system is set up when we set the \u003ccode\u003etop\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003ebottom\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eleft\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003ccode\u003eright\u003c/code\u003e CSS attributes for an element.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the file preview is in its default state, its position is set to \u003ccode\u003eabsolute\u003c/code\u003e. This means that the \u003ccode\u003etop\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003ebottom\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eleft\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003ccode\u003eright\u003c/code\u003e coordinates we use to determine the positioning of the file preview is relative to its parent container, which is nestled nicely in the flow of the page between the title and the description. When the file preview is in its expanded state, however, its position is set to \u003ccode\u003efixed\u003c/code\u003e, meaning that the coordinate system is relative to the browser window instead of the container in the page flow. The \u003ccode\u003efixed\u003c/code\u003e position is often used for “sticky” elements, like a navigation bar that freezes at the top of the page and moves with you, no matter how far you scroll.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor many CSS properties, the browser can create animations on its own given a start and end value (this works for the \u003ccode\u003etop\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003ebottom\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eleft\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003ccode\u003eright\u003c/code\u003e properties). However, animating between different \u003ccode\u003eposition\u003c/code\u003e values unfortunately isn\u0026#39;t supported out-of-the-box. We couldn’t simply change the starting or ending preview states to the other position either. Doing so meant that the default preview would always be stickied to its position on the page, no matter how far you scrolled, or that the expanded preview modal would be one that could be scrolled past.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe solution was to create an intermediary state that occurs right before the expanding and collapsing animation. In this intermediary state, we take the current state’s position value, as well as the  top, bottom, left, and right coordinates, and do a bit of math and set what the equivalent coordinate values would be in the next state’s coordinate system. This way, for a brief moment before the animation starts, the existing view is translated to the next view’s coordinate system so that the browser can interpolate and animate coordinate values. \u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"EaOwDausHf2P\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe (seemingly) invisible parts of the final experience are a result of many revisions and countless gifs sent back and forth to get the animation details, timings, and edge cases just right.

of us are used to this. However, this is not a fundamental property of programming languages.

Examples include Rust, OCaml, Haskell, and \u003ca href=\"https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/c-sharp-8-0-experimenting-with-non-nullable-reference-type-using-visual-studio-2017/\"\u003eC# as of version 8.0\u003c/a\u003e.

In non-strict code, this is of the most common types of error, and our historical data shows that a few of our high-severity incidents would have been caught by strict null checks before landing on production.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStrict null checks also improve the quality of code. Maintaining code involves asking questions about the code such as “is file info loaded at this point in the code?” Expressed in the type system, these questions often boil down to “can this value be null?” When the answer is right in the type, the code is much more maintainable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"incrementally-enabling-strict-null-checks\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#incrementally-enabling-strict-null-checks\"\u003eIncrementally enabling strict null checks\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough today the TypeScript community recommends starting new projects with strict null checks enabled, Figma started using TypeScript prior to TypeScript 2.0, when strict null checks were first implemented. Even after upgrading, we wrote new code that didn’t necessarily compile with the setting enabled. Our situation wasn’t unique: JavaScript codebases where types have been added incrementally also often don’t have strict null checks enabled, because JavaScript is inherently non-strict.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMigrating such codebases to strict null checks is challenging. Merely turning it on can generate thousands of errors. When we started the project, our frontend codebase of ~1162 TypeScript files generated over 4000 errors, and in many cases fixing one of them would reveal even more errors. It was clear that while this migration was not nearly as drastic as a full rewrite in a different architecture or language, it would require a similar thinking process. Here’s a few ways one might do it:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"stop-the-world\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#stop-the-world\"\u003eStop-the-world\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe could have asked all our engineers to stop working on their current project to participate in the migration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe didn’t feel this was the right decision: the work involved in migrating is parallelizable but not \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e parallelizable, so having everyone stop their work was not an optimal use of time. It would also have been strategically questionable, as our product work at the time was critical to maintaining business momentum. Finally, the logistics of coordinating between multiple teams becomes less practical the larger companies get.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"whack-a-mole\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#whack-a-mole\"\u003eWhack-a-mole\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother approach is to fix errors from enabling strict null checks over time, without actually enabling strict null checks (e.g. running them only during CI).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the least disruptive approach. The downside is that without strict null checks enforced, new code tends to introduce new errors. At startups that grow exponentially, that can be a lot of new code: during the time it took us to complete the migration, our codebase increased from 376k to 464k lines of code. A “whack-a-mole” strategy can still be reasonable if errors can be fixed faster than they are introduced, but having a “progress bar” that even occasionally moves backward is not fun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"progressive-allowlist\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#progressive-allowlist\"\u003eProgressive allowlist\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe approach we’ve taken is to strict null check one file at a time by adding them to an allowlist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore talking about the details of this approach, we’d like to give credit where it’s due!

That means that unlike some other more lint-like flags like \u003ccode\u003e--noImplicitAny\u003c/code\u003e, it makes sense to strict null check a file only if its dependencies are also strict. Therefore, a file can be added to the allowlist only after its dependencies are in the allowlist.

Dependency cycles made it more difficult to perform the migration incrementally: it’s not possible to add a single file in a cycle to the allowlist unless you add all of the files in the cycle simultaneously. In terms of the dependency graph, we had to treat each cycle as a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component\"\u003estrongly-connected component\u003c/a\u003e, which effectively becomes a single node in the dependency graph.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=439\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe largest cycle we had was a 500+ file monstrosity — almost half our codebase! In addition to unblocking the strict null check migration, breaking up this monolith would also improve the architecture of the codebase. To do so, we targeted common patterns that were causing cyclic dependencies. For example:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFigma uses Redux, so we have models, actions and reducers. We had previously been defining the models in the same file as the reducers. By moving models into their own file, the action file no longer needed to import from the reducer file, breaking the cycle.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll the modals in our UI were in the same cycle. They were all imported by the modal renderer in \u003ccode\u003emodal.ts\u003c/code\u003e, but each modal also imported constants from \u003ccode\u003emodal.ts\u003c/code\u003e.

We hosted two three-day sprints where members from different teams across Figma contributed to strict null checking files, particularly in their areas of expertise.

This, in turns, requires adding a lot of non-null assertions or a lot of if-statements. The former still leaves the code vulnerable to errors. The latter can be misleading to future readers when the if-statements turn out to be redundant. Either way, it makes the type annotations hard to trust, which reduces the value of strict null checks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the other hand, refactoring while migrating can make the whole process take much longer. It often requires the engineer not only to understand the code, but the corresponding product area to understand if nullability is intended. It also risks causing regressions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAt Figma, we encouraged the team to refactor when possible\u003c/strong\u003e. We believed the additional investment was worth it to make sure our type annotations could be trusted by future maintainers. While the migration did introduce a few regressions, our engineers are full-time employees and were around to fix them. Finally, we posit that if code broke during migration, it must have already been hard to reason about (with respect to nullability) and would likely be regressing later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the “when possible” part is important too. At the end of the day, the goal was to complete the migration, and being in a partially-migrated state has downsides — having two instances of the compiler eating up the CPU being one of many. So while we recommended refactoring, we also opted to give the team a lot of discretion and let people take shortcuts when it would take too long to do otherwise.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, the tradeoff will vary by situation. For example, in an open-source project with volunteer contributors, or in a system with a lot of legacy code, it may be a lot more troublesome to deal with regressions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce a majority of files passed strict null checks, the remaining work became less parallelizable. At that point, we switched from an allowlist to a denylist approach, using the \u003ccode\u003eexclude\u003c/code\u003e option instead of \u003ccode\u003efiles\u003c/code\u003e, so that new files are automatically compiled under strict mode. At this point, a few engineers were able to convert the remaining files and complete the project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"parting-thoughts\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#parting-thoughts\"\u003eParting thoughts\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn terms of catching errors, we can say that null errors no longer show up in our error dashboard. However, we would like to re-emphasize: the biggest benefit, though hard to measure, is probably the increased readability of our code. The parts of the code where TypeScript has the most trouble inferring nullability were often the ones that were hard for humans to reason about — and benefited the most from refactoring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith all that said, this migration wasn’t a straight path to the target.

The team already had established best practices for virtually every stage of the creation process — brainstorming, wireframing, prototyping, and commenting. As Lauren LoPrete, design systems lead, put it, “Figma has helped us simplify our workflows and also up-leveled the quality and efficiency of our work across design at Dropbox.” But once the pandemic hit and the team went fully remote, they needed to do more. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn an effort to reignite that creative spark that once happened IRL, the now-remote designers rely on Figma even more to streamline their workflows and remove any breakdowns in communication.

For example, the Design System and Brand Studio teams streamlined their handoff process, designing a Figma template for icons in which a brand designer will place a ✅ next to the page once the icon file is complete. Since their library release happens every Monday morning, the Design Systems team will check the file and convert any new icons to the master library, then hit publish. This has helped eliminate unnecessary comms and made the overall process more efficient — so much so that team plans to apply a similar process to other collaborative libraries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Stan Yeung, product designer, put it, ”Figma has become the center of our universe since the pandemic, with more communication and collaboration happening within the design files themselves.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?rect=1,0,1598,1040\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=436\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eOrganizing themes in action, from a design team brainstorm\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"figma-for-all\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#figma-for-all\"\u003eFigma for all\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the broader organization braced itself to transition to fully remote, the design team became the model for how teams can work together, virtually.

The goal was to get everyone comfortable with Figma so they could jam together again, just like they did in their office space. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCheechee explains, “We realized that bringing counterparts in to the process in Figma not only helped speed up our iteration cycles but also provided a space to visually communicate together — especially given the lack of whiteboards in a virtual-first world.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe training was such a success, they expanded the workshop to more than 200 attendees across teams like marketing, research and data science.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=428\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eVirtual high-fives at the XFN Workshop\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma is now open to the entire Dropbox organization and is a space where anyone can jump in, be creative and communicate visually together.

Like many others that used Google Docs at school and then returned home to virtual worlds, we intuitively understood that Internet native software embodies values like collaboration, transparency and access. Pretty much everyone around us — friends, classmates, coworkers we had interned with — shared these values, so we assumed they were self-evident.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe didn’t realize that launching Figma was heresy, a generational assault on top-down, siloed models of decision making and a challenge to the identity of many designers. While some immediately understood the potential of building design software in the browser, our vision elicited an immediate and negative reaction from others. Some even told us that if this was the future of design, they were changing careers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFeeling threatened by change is part of being human. It was only natural that moving what had previously been an offline, single-player experience into the browser would be a shock to many. The fears were sensible. I think many designers felt that more transparency would lead to an over-demystification of the design process, more micromanagement and tighter deadlines. For many, inviting others into Figma represents an implicit loss of control. (And if you’ve ever looked at how designers structure their layers, then you know how much designers like control!) Finally, increased access brings with it the most existential question of all: if anyone can design, what does it mean to be a designer?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInitially I didn’t understand the negative reactions to Figma’s closed beta launch. I only saw the obvious benefits: a single source of truth for files, cross platform support, and multiplayer editing. Now I understand that the power of the browser lies in the broader cultural change it delivers — and this change can be scary. The browser is natively multiplayer. It forces a mindset shift on access. It strips away the need for expensive hardware. And it pushes us to embrace working together, especially when we are blocked and our default might be to hide.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the best parts of my job as CEO of Figma is playing anthropologist. Over the past five years, I’ve seen firsthand how working in a collaborative digital space moves teams from a mindset of “my ideas” to “our ideas.” This requires a radical shift — a level of trust and transparency that many of us are still catching up to. In many ways, design is deeply personal, and opening up that work to others to build on and remix can feel like opening up a part of yourself. But that’s why this change is so important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eZooming out, the browser isn’t just about better workflows or improved collaboration. Working in the browser is part of a multi-decade global shift from physical spaces to digital spaces, massively accelerated by COVID-19. Like physical spaces, digital spaces help us connect to one another. Unlike physical spaces, digital spaces have no walls: by default they are non-hierarchical. Everyone is invited to brainstorm, build, and play together. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn \u003cem\u003eUnderstanding Media\u003c/em\u003e Marshall McLuhan writes about how “all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems.” But at its best, Figma is much more than a digital extension of our physical self—it’s an invitation to leave ego at the door and create shared consciousness with others. It’s an opportunity to embrace the messy bits of creativity, to celebrate failure and bring more people into the process along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma’s vision is to make design accessible to all. If we succeed, putting Figma as a skill on a resume will be as absurd as highlighting Google Docs proficiency. The browser brings us closer to this vision, but we have a lot of work still ahead. We hope Figma can support every role, in every part of the design process — from ideation to production, imagination to reality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope this level of openness and access will extend far beyond design and product development. We can’t allow hardware, specialized tools and titles to block that progress. As technologists, we have a responsibility to make it so that more people can use our platforms, not fewer. What I’ve seen over these past five years is that the browser is the medium to ignite that impact. If you make software, I challenge you to build with this ethos.

Over time, we worked hard to incorporate user feedback, bringing more power and flexibility while keeping an intuitive editor experience. Ultimately, this led to where we are today—a refreshed and revamped Auto Layout that goes beyond just a new coat of paint.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"resizable-dreams\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#resizable-dreams\"\u003eResizable dreams\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-auto-layout/\"\u003elaunched Auto Layout in 2019\u003c/a\u003e, resizing designs in Figma was a manual task. For example, if you were designing a dialog box with several buttons and needed to make the text in one of the buttons longer, you had to manually resize that button to accommodate the extra characters, scooch the other buttons over to make room, and then resize the dialog container to fit everything—all while keeping padding and spacing consistent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve all been there, and it’s frustrating. Beyond feeling tedious, this type of manual work can become a roadblock to building responsive design systems. It’s why bringing the power of automatic layout to designers has always been in our plans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, early designs of Figma incorporated ideas of automatic layout in the sidebar. While it was an unlabeled dropdown under the “Layout” section of the properties panel, the idea was the same. Instead of manually laying out objects within a frame, users could rely on Figma to do the work automatically, with options for vertical or horizontal layout. Unfortunately, this wasn’t implemented when Figma launched, and traces of the fabled Auto Layout laid dormant in Figma’s source code until \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/the-making-of-maker-week/\"\u003eMaker Week\u003c/a\u003e 2018.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=339\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eEarly designs of Figma included the idea for automatic layout\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring this week when all Figmates can do and build anything they want, our product director \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/skuwamoto\"\u003eSho\u003c/a\u003e breathed new life to our Auto Layout dreams by reimagining the feature in prototypes. The following year, I joined Figma and landed on a newly formed team whose goal was to make Auto Layout a reality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"team-alignment\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#team-alignment\"\u003eTeam alignment\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we started building Auto Layout, we were inspired by the power and versatility of flexbox. (Figma’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/\"\u003ebuilt on the web\u003c/a\u003e, so how could we not be?) We knew that mirroring this concept would help drive alignment between code and design. But at the same time, we still needed to make Figma’s layout system easy to understand and accessible to use—without requiring a deep knowledge of browsers and CSS. Thus, our guiding principle was born: “Auto Layout should be a thoughtful subset of flexbox.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis sort of mission statement for the team guided the design decisions we made, unlocking functionality while reducing the number of moving parts for ease of use. Ultimately, this boiled down to a few core concepts: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAuto Layout can be enabled on a frame, allowing components to be laid out vertically or horizontally\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVertical and horizontal spacing between items can be set\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn Auto Layout frame will hug its components in the main axis while the other “counter” axis can also be set to a fixed width to hug the components\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eComponents in Auto Layout frames can each have their own alignment to the container, either being aligned left, center, or right—or top, center, or bottom in horizontal Auto Layout frames\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was really helpful when \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mwichary\"\u003eMarcin\u003c/a\u003e, the designer of Auto Layout, started by making a prototype completely in HTML. It gave us a feel for the feature early on and helped us iron out \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1202618685795553280?lang=en\"\u003emany details in our first version\u003c/a\u003e, like frame handle decoration, drag behavior, and outlines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"stretch-goals\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#stretch-goals\"\u003eStretch goals\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first version of Auto Layout quickly proved to be useful. I also noticed that Figmates were using the feature internally to organize everything from artboards to presentation slides and create reusable components like sticky notes and name tags. But we knew we had more work to do. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAuto Layout allowed for automatic alignment to the left, right, or center of a frame. However, as the frame grew, the components would stay the same size. What designers needed was “stretch”—an alignment option that would allow components in an Auto Layout frame to expand, filling the entire width or height of the container, no matter how it was resized. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt sounds pretty straightforward on paper, but actually getting this to work in the layout engine was tricky. In the first version of Auto Layout, containers only relied on the size of their components, so it was guaranteed that by laying out the components first, and containers last, you would end up with a valid layout. However, stretch meant that the components could also depend on the size of their containers, so our layout assumptions no longer held up. We had to develop a new engine that could handle these new relationships, with the ability to go back and forth between container and component to make sure all layout demands were met.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the design side, we played around with some pretty bold ideas. Looking at help center articles and feature requests, we found a lot of designers referring to Auto Layout alignment options as “constraints,” which is another feature in Figma. Conceptually, there were many similarities, as they both included options for left, center, right, and now stretch. We toyed around with the idea of Auto Layout being integrated into the constraints panel, making Auto Layout feel more integrated with the rest of Figma’s layout tools. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, we ended up shipping stretch without these UI changes because we already had additional features in mind for the next iteration of Auto Layout. It was important to give ourselves the necessary time and space to thoughtfully change the UI in a way that would comfortably include all of them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"staying-flexible\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#staying-flexible\"\u003eStaying flexible\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we began to design more flexibility into the next version of Auto Layout, we got a much needed team boost. \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/eymlin?lang=en\"\u003eEmily\u003c/a\u003e, our new product manager, learned flexbox to put together an amazing spec that included everything from flexbox terminology to relevant support tickets to user requested features. \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/sawyerhood?lang=en\"\u003eSawyer\u003c/a\u003e, an engineer on an adjacent team, whipped up a quick prototype on a Friday night, incorporating many of the advanced layout features on our wishlist. And \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rsms\"\u003eRasmus\u003c/a\u003e, our designer, got to work exploring countless ideas and mockups, eventually arriving on our final designs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we sat down to scope and flesh out these features, we realized one of the new features—stretch in the primary axis—would introduce complexity. To date, stretch was tied to alignment and only able to be set in the counter axis. But as designers became more familiar with Auto Layout, it was pretty common to see Auto Layout frames nested within other Auto Layout frames. This revealed use cases where it would be helpful for items to stretch in the main axis as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, bringing stretch to both axes wasn’t as simple as adding another alignment button for stretch in the primary axis. Making the primary axis fixed would allow us to stretch items. However, adding the option for fixed size in the primary axis would also mean adding an option to align items in the primary axis when there’s free space. With container and component frames, these additions would result in two different alignment and resizing options and create a cluttered and confusing sidebar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo simplify alignment, we made a conceptual leap to move all alignment to the container. Instead of setting alignment at the component level, alignment is set at the container level. Components can still be individually aligned by wrapping them in an additional Auto Layout frame. A point-and-click UI to set alignment (with a built-in preview), which we tucked away in a popover menu, allowed us to keep the main properties panel footprint minimal and approachable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?rect=0,0,1640,915\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=374\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA new alignment panel allows setting alignment in two dimensions, with a preview \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith alignment taken care of, we wanted to make resizing more intuitive as well. Since a frame can’t stretch and hug at the same time, we thought about consolidating these controls into a single three-way dropdown, with “Fill Container,” “Hug Contents,” and “Fixed.” Knowing that these controls are possible in both axes, we realized that two dropdowns were necessary: one for width and the other for height.

This has been a huge team effort with the amazing engineers that I get to work with every day, as well as teams across the company, from infrastructure to product education.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?rect=0,0,1600,855\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=358\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eAuto Layout, then and now\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaking Auto Layout from the forgotten traces in our code base to what it is today has been \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q5uBR52G2Q\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u0026amp;list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7kSHHiltBqo3FK__aB5HZi\"\u003equite the journey\u003c/a\u003e.

This feature, along with changes to the Inspect panel and updates to Auto Layout (rolling out in November!), will enable designers and developers to work more efficiently together. Below, we dive into how we built Variants, including the crucial pieces of feedback our users gave us along the way.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"_h7yuVHidF0v\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe believe that a design tool should \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/config-europe-2020-new-feature-announcements/\"\u003eembrace concepts from both design and code\u003c/a\u003e. But every product team will balance these competing considerations differently. While development is about finalizing and scaling a solution through rigor and reusability, design needs uninhibited freedom to iterate on the most promising ideas. The more freedom ideas can have, the more innovative the design solution can be. At Figma, our job is to give you the tools—however way you and your teams work—to design and develop effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we thought about how to bridge design and code in Figma, we realized the biggest opportunity was to redesign how components are treated. Not only was it difficult to find the right components and switch between related variations (bye, endless instance swap menus!), keeping your design systems organized was tedious and didn’t map to how developers think about components. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we started to design towards this solution, we worked closely with our users to refine the experience, so it’s helpful and intuitive for a variety of use cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"aligning-how-designers-and-developers-think\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#aligning-how-designers-and-developers-think\"\u003eAligning how designers and developers think\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a company grows, its design system inherently gets more complex. To manage this complexity, many design system managers adopted a “forward-slash” naming convention to organize components (e.g. default/primary/large/icon). They worked around the limits of our component feature in order to communicate various states and properties that commonly exist in code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen designing Variants, we wanted to evolve our components feature to support multiple dimensions of variation and a key:value pair naming convention, like state=”hover” and style=”secondary.” Whether your design system consists of simple, single-dimensional components or more complex, multi-dimensional ones, your components in Figma will better mirror your components in code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter shadowing several design system managers, we noticed that they typically laid out components in a grid in order to work on different variations of a component and compare variations to one another. As a result, we architected the new Variants feature so that all variations of a single component can be laid out \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055471353-Prepare-for-Variants#canvas\"\u003eside-by-side\u003c/a\u003e—based on how design system managers actually work in Figma. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis not only proved to be useful for design iterations and library maintenance, it also opened the door for us to build a simple path for users to start using the new Variants feature—simply select all component variations and click “Combine Variants” into one component set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"refining-the-ui-through-usability-tests\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#refining-the-ui-through-usability-tests\"\u003eRefining the UI through usability tests\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter nailing down component organization, we wanted to design a UI that was both intuitive to use and easy to consume. We built a functional prototype and ran 4 rounds of usability tests over the course of 6 weeks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the harder design challenges to solve was communicating the new key:value naming construct. Our first designs showed all available property values as pills. However, we soon discovered that users struggled to understand this UI as it behaved differently than they intuitively expected. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause pills are commonly used for tagging an object with multiple attributes, our original premise of always showing all values as pills did not work. After a few iterations, we simplified and switched to a dropdown menu design, only showing a simple input field for every property when a specific variant is selected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?rect=0,0,3428,1688\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=330\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, we kept the pill design whenever users wanted to see all properties and values of an entire component set.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother learning we discovered along the way is default naming. For example, presenting system defaults like \u003cem\u003eState\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eStyle\u003c/em\u003e was actually less intuitive, compared to presenting generic property values (e.g. “Property 1,” “Property 2”) which made it more clear that they should be customized to values like \u003cem\u003eType\u003c/em\u003e or \u003cem\u003eSize\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"figuring-out-the-right-feature-name\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#figuring-out-the-right-feature-name\"\u003eFiguring out the right feature name\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we got closer to launching Variants, we had to embark on what is usually the most difficult part of any product development process—deciding on the feature name. At the start of this project, we called the feature “States,” as the initial use case we focused on was supporting the complexity of interactive states. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring user testing, one of our users at Fidelity Investments pointed out that the name “States” did not fully represent the full scope and possibilities of this feature. The feature didn’t just enable users to create different states of a component (e.g. hover, active, disabled), it can flex to any property type, like type, color, size, and more: “States seems to water down the power of the feature,” the Fidelity team said. “It makes you think of just button or object states.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile we couldn’t exactly call it “super customizable component that you can do whatever you want with—feature,” we did agree that the name needed a revisit. Variants emerged as a much better way to capture the complexity the feature can support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we started to use “Variants” in subsequent usability tests, our users further validated that name was more intuitive and representative of the scope of the feature. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePaired with the upcoming Auto Layout updates and the new changes to Inspect panel, Variants is working to help you design and develop products more efficiently.

Engineer \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/digitalfreepen\"\u003eRudi Chen\u003c/a\u003e takes us behind the scenes of building this update: how we made product decisions, managed large merge conflicts, and navigated the complexities of Figma’s multiplayer technology.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"agEmrosFHwyp\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt wasn’t so long ago that software made you hit the save key obsessively. After all, we’ve all had an unlucky circumstance in which we closed the application accidentally, it crashed, or we lost power—and hours of work. In online applications like Figma, we flush changes to the server as soon as they’re made; offline changes can’t sync with the server until you reconnect to the internet. Until recently, users ran the risk of losing data should something happen to their computer or browser while offline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith our newly expanded autosave system, edits now save to disk when a document becomes disconnected from the server so changes to the document persist—even if the tab with Figma closes. When the user next reloads this document in a new tab, the changes will be restored and uploaded to the server.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut why does such a feature warrant a blog post? “Saving the file to disk periodically” isn’t exactly a groundbreaking innovation. But as it often happens, interesting challenges lie not in individual features, but the interaction between them. Figma’s central paradigm is being a browser-based, cloud-based, and realtime application. \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/\"\u003eWe’ve written\u003c/a\u003e about how we handle conflict resolution in multiplayer before. Now, in the process of examining autosave, we’ll see how how supporting multiplayer adds a lot of complexity to other features too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-write-changes-to-disk\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how-to-write-changes-to-disk\"\u003eHow to write changes to disk\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most intuitive way to save a document is how it has always been done: serialize the in-memory representation of the document as a backup file and write it to disk. Restoring lost changes is as simple as opening the backup. There’s not much room for things to go wrong in this approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnfortunately, in the context of a cloud-based application, this approach isn’t practical both from a technical and product standpoint.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Figma, documents are represented as a tree of layers (nodes). We refer to it as the \u003cstrong\u003escenegraph\u003c/strong\u003e and it is our central data structure. It turns out that our users can and do create very large documents. We regularly see files that are tens of megabytes as a compressed binary and hundred of megabytes when loaded in memory. Serializing the largest files can actually take a few seconds. Last year, this was a big enough issue to \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/\"\u003edisqualify our initial implementation\u003c/a\u003e for a plugin sandboxing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, the performance requirements for autosave are actually much higher than plugins. Even if we managed to optimize serialization by 10-20x so that it only takes 100ms, this is still unacceptable. The user would experience a regular 100ms stutter whenever we save the file since Figma is built in the browser and JavaScript and WASM are single-threaded.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt would be nice to use shared memory multithreading, but it’s barely supported by browsers and not a safe option. Rather, a typical way that Figma deals with expensive operations is to split work across multiple frames. However, this isn’t merely a browser/JavaScript problem. Concurrency, regardless of how it’s achieved, opens up an even bigger challenge: the problem that the user could make changes to the document during serialization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn an ideal architecture, serialization would read-off an immutable scenegraph. However, while elegant, that would require an immense rewrite of the application, as the scenegraph is used by almost every bit of our product code. Furthermore, immutable data structures are not a silver bullet—they come with tradeoffs such as slower write performance and increased memory usage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, in terms of product decisions, saving the entire file also opens up non-trivial questions. Since our files are cloud-based and can be edited by multiple people at once, replacing the existing file with the backup could end up overwriting \u003cem\u003enewer\u003c/em\u003e changes in the file. Leaving the backup as a copy also fails, because some files are the source of truth for shared assets (components such as buttons, modals in a design system).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"saving-changes-as-a-delta\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#saving-changes-as-a-delta\"\u003eSaving changes as a delta\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe alternative to saving the entire file is to write to disk only the changes made since the document went offline. We have this “delta” as part of our collaborative editing system, to keep track of which changes need to be sent to and acknowledged by the server. To restore changes, it suffices to apply this diff on top of the latest version of the document.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo the prototypical case looks something like this:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eUser loads document\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUser ends up offline\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUser makes changes, which get stored in an in-memory pending changes buffer\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContents of the pending change buffer are committed to disk on a regular interval\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDocument closes unexpectedly\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUser loads document again\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePending changes are deserialized and applied on top of the document\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePending changes are uploaded to the server\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are a few options for on-disk storage via browser APIs. Since we want to store potentially large amounts of data, in smaller chunks for access performance, and data integrity is important, we use IndexedDB. Key features include database indices and transactional operations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pending changes are stored as a set of property changes on a per-file, per-(node/layer) basis. This level of granularity helps achieve a balance between storage overhead and redundant IO. The more granular the changes, the more overhead is used to store each row. However, if we stored pending changes for all nodes in a single object, then we would have to write the entire set of pending changes every time a change is made. By storing changes per-node, we only need to write changes between commits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"beyond-linearity\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#beyond-linearity\"\u003eBeyond linearity\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen dealing with linear history, re-applying a stored diff to a document isn’t hard. After all, that’s how undo-redo works, a pretty basic feature in Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Figma was a single-user application, it’d be relatively easy to ensure that [autosave] \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e needs to be implemented in the context of a linear history. For example, you could ensure that only one instance of Figma could open a file at a given time, and require the user to apply or discard autosaved changes immediately upon re-opening the file.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, in a collaborative editor, documents don’t have a purely linear history. Even when users are not explicitly creating branches of their document, they are continuously creating implicit branches whenever they make local edits. We don’t normally think of these as branches, because the real-time capabilities of the editor means these transient branches get “merged” within fractions of a second. But as the animation shows below, we might say that a branch was created at some point in time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe autosave feature, however, targets use cases in which the user is disconnected from our servers for minutes to hours. The client could be making much larger sets of changes and leave them on disk for days. The server could also have receiving much larger sets of changes from other clients in the meantime. Then, autosave changes are more clearly a branch that split off from the file at the time the user disconnected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTherefore, autosave often needs to “merge” the diff on top of the latest document. And doing so creates unexpected and rather subtle issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven in the absence of other users, it’s possible for the same user to edit a document from multiple tabs. These sets of changes must then be applied sequentially on top of the latest document.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"large-merge-conflicts\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#large-merge-conflicts\"\u003eLarge merge conflicts\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of the time, merging diffs just works. After all, our data structures are designed to support concurrent editing. However, our multiplayer system is meant to handle small conflicts during editing. The assumption is that you get immediate visual feedback if changes between you and your coworker are clashing. Our system does not understand \u003cem\u003euser intent\u003c/em\u003e, a notoriously hard problem, and therefore may not be able to effectively merge large-scale changes without creating a \u003cem\u003emess\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, just because these large-scale conflicts are \u003cem\u003epossible\u003c/em\u003e doesn’t mean that they are \u003cem\u003ecommon\u003c/em\u003e. To optimize for making the common use case work smoothly, we automatically create a version history checkpoint (a feature in Figma similar to a Git commit) before and after applying the diff. This allows the user to easily revert the merge in the event in these special cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA more proper solution would be to create an interface that would allow users to resolve merge conflicts. However, effectively representing diffs visually for a 2D design document is still an unsolved problem in the industry and could well be a larger project than autosave itself. (Of course, that’s also worth solving, but as a separate problem.) By making product decisions such that the two projects aren’t interdependent, we can function more effectively as an organization. It may be less exciting, but it lowers coordination overhead needed when adding more people to a project. It also makes it easier to validate our solutions incrementally. Sometimes, we run into unexpected technical limitations or user feedback that require us to redo parts of a project. Leaner projects lower that risk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen a technical solution isn’t available yet, we can also help mitigate the issue via product solutions. We also show UI in the file browser that actively prompts the user to restore their changes. Besides reducing the chances of server-side conflict, this design indicate that this feature is meant for crash recovery, not as a long-term local storage solution. After all, it is only storing diffs, not entire files.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe tradeoff is that when you do have changes, the UI is intentionally very prominent. Therefore, it becomes especially important to not have autosave changes if the user doesn’t “expect” to have lost changes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"stale-changes\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#stale-changes\"\u003eStale changes\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve looked at the targeted use case where we leave local changes on disk and the tab closes. But the most common scenario is when the tab stays open: we write changes to disk, then latter the tab reconnects, syncs change to the server, then clears those changes from disk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to make sure these changes have been cleared from disk. With autosave, an important invariant is that the node changes stored on disk are exactly equal to the pending node changes stored in memory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClearly, if we’re missing a change on disk, then there’s a potential data loss bug.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, if we have extra changes on disk, that’s \u003cem\u003ealso\u003c/em\u003e a problem. From a UX perspective, it’s quite confusing for the user to be prompted about unsaved changes that have, in reality, already been saved to the server. But stale changes are even worse than redundant changes. For example, if one of the changes says “set the height of nodeID=15 to 100” but the user had since changed the height of that node from 100 to 50, that’s also a bug.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we were dealing with linear history, the worst a stale change could do is no-op. Still, even no-op changes are noisy. Furthermore, with branching history, the stale change could end up overwriting a newer change. Although the checkpoint we create makes this reversible, it still appears to the user as if “Figma lost some recent edits,” thereby reducing user trust and counteracting the whole point of this feature to begin with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve run into a number of ways in which we can end up with stale changes on disk. First, there’s the asynchronous nature of the process. When a tab reconnects to the server, it sends the pending changes, then waits for an acknowledgment. Until then, the document is in an unsaved state and we prevent the user from closing the tab to avoid losing changes. However, while an autosave change is stale as soon as it arrives on the server, it is safe to clear from disk once the client has received the ack. Therefore, we consider the document to be in an unsaved state until the changes are acknowledged by the server \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e cleared from disk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also encountered subtle bugs. For example, some changes never got cleared from disk if a tab disconnected and reconnected. To share some context, the autosave implementation involves a document change observer to keep track of changes that need to be uploaded to the server, or written to disk. The issue was that after connecting, we reapply any local offline changes on top of the latest version of the document from the server. However, if the local change was the same as the latest server change, the property setter would no-op and short-circuit the code before it triggered the observers. As a result, the autosave system was never notified that this change needed to be removed from disk. Our solution to this issue was to take a more conservative approach. After reconnecting, it’s safer to erase the changes already stored on disk and re-serialize all pending changes. With IndexedDB, this can be done in a single transaction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"essential-complexity\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#essential-complexity\"\u003eEssential complexity\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn one hand, the additional complexity to implement autosave is largely \u003cem\u003eaccidental\u003c/em\u003e, having only to do with the particular design of the system. The exact wrinkles to iron out will differ from system to system. However, the fact that there are many of these sorts of wrinkles is fundamentally due to the branching that occurs because of Figma’s multiplayer capabilities. And that, is \u003cem\u003eessential\u003c/em\u003e complexity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe challenges we encountered implementing autosave are representative of a more general set of challenges we encounter at Figma. As much as we would like a multiplayer system to be a self-contained black box, the truth is that it\u0026#39;s a leaky abstraction. Supporting collaborative editing as a central paradigm in our application means that we\u0026#39;re introducing a lot more asynchronous behavior such as transient branches. This then leads to thorny issues and ultimately, more complexity in the many of the features we build.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese features are what make Figma a powerful product and as a side effect, there are always plenty of interesting engineering challenges to solve.

In doing so, they beat Wall Street’s expectations this past quarter with a posted revenue of $4.61 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut just a few years ago, the company’s growth curve told a different story. Even though a quarter of the world’s population touches Kimberly-Clark’s products every day, changing consumer preferences, stiff competition, and increased production costs stifled demand. Amid layoffs and cost reduction in 2018, they embarked on a new initiative to accelerate growth by the company’s 150th anniversary in 2022. At the core of this initiative was to double down on the digital presence of their personal care products. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"going-digital-starting-with-a-web-based-design\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#going-digital-starting-with-a-web-based-design\"\u003eGoing digital starting with a web-based design platform\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, Kimberly-Clark has over 400 global consumer-based websites and a large portfolio of digital products. From managing pricing, manufacturing, distribution, merchandising, shelving, sales, to people operations, every step of the process has a digital component to make sure their products get from their mills to neighborhood stores. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith so many brands and 175 countries to localize for, there’s a lot that goes into building a cohesive digital experience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We needed to start by changing how we worked,” said UX Manager, Andy Ford. “Our designers were jumping through so many hoops—spending weeks designing alone in proprietary Mac based applications, uploading files into a cloud prototyping platform, waiting for stakeholder feedback, going through the loop again to make edits. And when we were finally ready for development, we faced yet another hurdle when trying to hand-off design files to developers who were not on Macs. Obviously, this process slowed down how we launch new products.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving used Figma previously, Ford knew that consolidating tools within a single platform would solve these inefficiencies. “With Figma, everything is just there,” Ford said. “It becomes the single source of truth. Nothing is saved locally and anyone you invite can easily join to view and edit a file. Feedback meetings transformed into collaborative real-time working sessions with our various stakeholders. Everyone started to participate in the making process and could see design updates come to life in front of their eyes.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?rect=0,0,1778,913\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=344\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_71-increase-in-signups-when-design-problems-are\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_71-increase-in-signups-when-design-problems-are\"\u003e71% increase in signups when design problems are solved as a team\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile teams started closely collaborating and design workflows grew more efficient, it was also important to Ford to measure whether or not their work materially impacted consumers’ experience on their websites. To do so, he keeps a close eye on the engagement metrics the UX design team cares most about—bounce rates, return visitors, or time on site and signups for awards, coupons, or newsletters. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“One of our websites had a form that contained 13 fields because our marketing team wanted to collect lots of info upfront,” Ford explained. “But obviously more fields tend to yield lower signup rates. Instead of debating this in a meeting, our brand, marketing, and design teams all jumped into Figma together and designed a solution to reduce the friction down to 5 fields.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the new form went live, it led to a 71% increase in signups. “Because of Figma, we were able to solve the problems on the fly as a team and walk away all believing in the same direction,” Ford said. “This helps us get our products to market faster.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeeing the impact of these design changes, the team is already planning new digital initiatives. Next up: a new design system that integrates from Figma, to Storybook, to their code repository.

He asks, “How might we make a design system inclusive to allow anyone to contribute to [and] use the system?” It’s \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/b8NNfdRcgpI?t=310\"\u003enot just about pattern libraries\u003c/a\u003e, Declan says, noting that design systems can include different types of components like accessibility, data, and project management. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis openness extends beyond tools and resources. “Designers are opening up,” Declan says. “We’re accepting more people outside our design circles.” Just like how close collaboration with people across the product development team can make a design system more effective, welcoming more people with a diverse set of skills into the process—across design, development, product management, and beyond—will result in more “human-centered design, products, and services,” Declan says. “It’s all about expanding the team.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"celebrating-failure\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#celebrating-failure\"\u003eCelebrating failure\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma’s \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/kelseymwhelan\"\u003eKelsey Whelan\u003c/a\u003e, Product Manager, and Product Designer \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/nikolasklein\"\u003eNikolas Klein\u003c/a\u003e agree that getting diverse perspectives results in better products, even (and especially) when that means failing in front of each other. For Niko and Kelsey, “failing together” was a huge part of the success of Variants, a feature \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/config-europe-2020-new-feature-announcements/#supporting-design-systems-that-mirror-your-code\"\u003ewe announced\u003c/a\u003e at Config Europe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the team started testing early versions of the feature, they realized “it was really powerful,” says Kelsey, “but it wasn’t very approachable,” which meant that they still had work to do. “We wanted this feature to be one that anyone at Figma could use—or any Figma user could.” Once they made adjustments and were ready to conduct usability testing, what they thought would be a series of short tests over a couple weeks turned into four rounds of testing over six weeks. In other words, Kelsey says, “We were much further off than we realized.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey decided to make the most of the remote environment and invite everyone at Figma to participate. In addition to those who worked directly on the product, Figmates across teams—including designer advocates, product educators, and engineering managers—joined usability tests via Zoom. With these different perspectives, the team even caught some bugs during the sessions and discussed fixes in the dedicated Slack channel. “Of course it’s hard seeing that your ideas aren’t working,” says Niko. But once the working group incorporated feedback and people started to get it more intuitively, it was \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ETLYF7R7j0\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u0026amp;t=1324\"\u003eeven more rewarding\u003c/a\u003e to see things work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe usability tests were a reminder that inviting more people into the process results not only in a better experience for our users, but also in a more open culture for our team—one in which failure is considered an opportunity to improve, iterate, and as Niko says, “\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ETLYF7R7j0\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u0026amp;t=1286\"\u003efail forward\u003c/a\u003e,” together. \u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"Ar3_00ANkFyu\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt has been exactly one month since Config Europe, and we still can’t get over the fact that nearly 10,000 of you across 150 countries virtually came together to learn, share, and connect.

(Figma’s community of professional designers was doing this already in cities around the world and we were looking forward to bringing our learnings to the student community). When it started looking like many students wouldn’t be heading back to campus in the fall, we went back to the drawing board. Instead of focusing on local, campus-specific programs, what could we create that would ripple out beyond classroom walls? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe started by talking to students to learn what would be most impactful to help them navigate this new world:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow are schools planning for the fall?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat will the classroom look like?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow can students and educators recreate a collaborative classroom or on-campus feeling when not everyone is in the room together?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do students come together to work on extracurricular projects?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis got us to a few key areas we wanted to make progress on this summer: classroom resources, student stories, our Virtual Campus Slack Community, and hackathons.

As invoices and letters become increasingly digital, the team has had to reckon with revisiting the customer experience to keep up with ever-evolving needs. So, when the team went about digitizing the entire user journey, they wanted to make sure it wasn’t just about creating a new app, but finding a way to modernize an organization that goes back hundreds of years. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo make sweeping changes, they had to adjust their approach as a company. That meant coming from a place of principles, with design at the center. They landed on a framework: grow (keep up with users as they evolve); delight (turn disappointments into something positive); reduce (provide reliable services); listen (find ways for customers to surface their needs). Design System Lead \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/AngelosArnis\"\u003eAngelos Arnis\u003c/a\u003e says that it was a guide for the organization on \u0026#34;what great means.” Instead of focusing on one deliverable or digital touchpoint, they thought about the entire user journey, holistically.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile a postal service is the epitome of function and efficient operations, Angelos reminds us that it’s not just about the service, but what it powers: “When we talk about Posti, we talk about 400 years of emotions,” he says. Whether it’s a love letter, taxes, or a social security card for a newborn baby, these changes will help Posti Group continue to manage people’s most important communications. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"character-vs-skill\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#character-vs-skill\"\u003eCharacter vs. skill\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eConvertKit\u0026#39;s \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/charliprangley\"\u003eCharli Marie Prangley\u003c/a\u003e, Marketing Design Lead, shares how building a brand and reputation in the design community isn’t just about whether you can create a high-performing landing page or design a beautiful logo. Rather, your brand comes down to both skills “you have as a designer” and, more importantly, character—”who you are as a person.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether you’re looking to win clients, land a great job, or build your reputation, Charli Marie urges everyone to ask themselves: “How do you want people to describe you?” Creative? Kind? Fun? It’s not just about skill, craft, and function—it’s personality, connection, and humanity. By defining these characteristics, she says, as you create more and share more in the community, you’ll be able to evaluate whether your online presence is an accurate reflection of your values. When in doubt, “Do what’s authentic to you,” she says. “There’s someone out there who’s really going to value your perspective.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"function-and-feeling\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#function-and-feeling\"\u003eFunction and feeling\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile skill, craft, and function are all core to design as a discipline, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/iamharaldur\"\u003eHalli Thorleifsson\u003c/a\u003e, founder and Design Director at Ueno, urges everyone—whatever it is you’re building or designing—to \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/iamdavidhill/status/1306624962577530881?s=20\"\u003edo work that has meaning\u003c/a\u003e. It’s never “just a website” or “just an app,” he says. Similarly, it’s not just about finding a tool or design system that works for your team; rather it’s about the work and connection that those tools enable. “What we build with our tools—and why—is ultimately all that matters,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEspecially as so many of us continue to work remotely, it’s more important than ever to stay connected to each other. As Halli says, technology can unite us: “I believe it can connect us. I believe it can help us belong.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKnowing that nearly 10,000 of you from over 150 countries came together at Config Europe, we certainly feel that way too. And while many of us came away with learnings that can help us do better work and build better products, above all, we hope that connections you made—with each other, as part of this community—are what really stick.

Trust is the backbone of an open and inclusive culture, and the right processes—which govern how you design, develop, and work together as a team—can, in turn, result in more open and inclusive products. Here, we’ve curated more highlights from the conference on how to do just that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"going-beyond-the-perfect-use-case\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#going-beyond-the-perfect-use-case\"\u003eGoing beyond the “perfect” use case\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, deeply understanding your users and their needs is the foundation of any good product. But that also means understanding all types of users and use cases, and familiarizing yourself with challenges and requirements that may not be top of mind. While a target persona or core use case may be your north star, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/furquan101\"\u003eFurquan Ahmad\u003c/a\u003e, Product Designer at Ford Motor Company, says that developing user empathy should extend beyond the “perfect use case.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Too often, apps and services are designed for the same core user group,” he says. To cultivate user empathy, Furquan encourages everyone to get out and experience their product “in the field.” For example, he says, If you work on a delivery app, put yourself in the shoes of someone making a delivery. It’s easy to forget that they’ll have to walk up flights of stairs if an elevator is broken in an apartment building, or they won’t be able to find their way if their GPS doesn’t work in a more remote location.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaking a more inclusive view of your users will help you \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/888825248848211972\"\u003ethink more deeply about accessibility\u003c/a\u003e as well. While Furquan says you can start by making some small accessibility improvements, like simplifying copy, colors, font sizes, and the layout of a landing page, lasting change comes with prioritizing accessibility more holistically. This also extends to “temporary” accessibility, situational considerations that otherwise may not be top of mind. Furquan says these needs might revolve around location—like if someone is in a crowded place where it’s hard to hear—or equipment (think: a shattered phone screen). Whether you’re making small changes on color contrast or rethinking your approach to accessibility more broadly, a good place to start is making sure that there’s accountability. “Who’s taking ownership at your organization?” he asks. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGetting a sense for more use cases and taking a more expansive view of your users will result in a better product. “What’s essential for some,” Furquan says, is “useful for all.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"close-collaboration-across-the-organization\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#close-collaboration-across-the-organization\"\u003eClose collaboration across the organization\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@annesophie.delafosse\"\u003eAnne-Sophie Delafosse\u003c/a\u003e, Localization Manager at Deliveroo, localization is similarly part of the whole user journey. Localization isn’t just translating copy, but thinking about how syntax, language nuances, and broader cultural considerations can make your designs friendlier to markets around the world. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUp until recently, whenever Deliveroo prepared to launch a product in a new market, a designer would build a user experience and hand off that design to engineers, who would then manually upload a screenshot to each piece of translated text. Realizing that this process felt siloed and inefficient, the team decided to use the \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/803669834214399971/Phrase\"\u003ePhrase Figma plugin\u003c/a\u003e to allow designers to quickly build, share, and iterate on localized designs. Now, Anne-Sophie can share these lightweight prototypes with, say, the Italian or French teams. If there’s an issue with the localized version—an inaccurate translation or not enough space for the translated phrase—the localization teams can offer early feedback at the design stage, saving engineers from having to build a new page each time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlus, the localization team can see how their work maps to the bigger picture: “Our localization experts see the entire flow in one go. They have the full context,” says Anne-Sophie. Beyond saving time, this new process has reframed localization; rather than a transactional handoff between the localization and design teams, it’s an essential part of the product development process. As a result, both teams better understand “what it means to create a user journey for a global audience” that spans many languages and cultures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"open-processes-with-your-team\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#open-processes-with-your-team\"\u003eOpen processes with your team\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eImproving collaboration across your organization is key, but it starts with your immediate team. Especially as so many of us continue to work remotely, it’s more important than ever to establish more open routines and processes. “This lack of visual and spatial awareness of a teammate has meant remote working requires more transparency across teams,” says remote freelance designer \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/katepincott?lang=en\"\u003eKate Pincott\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd transparency extends to how you spend your time. Especially with remote work, it can be hard to see who’s working on what and how much time they have for meetings. Kate’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/888177404156464065\"\u003eTeam Capacity Template\u003c/a\u003e outlines how to map out a typical week and visualize any gaps. In addition to giving everyone visibility into how others spend their time, it also helps the team work more efficiently. Since you can’t just walk over to a teammates’s desk, she recommends using regularly-scheduled meetings and quick stand-ups to catch up on a personal level. “It’s ok that we spend more time on what’s important to get us through this period,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma Product Designer \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanhsu/\"\u003eJordan Hsu\u003c/a\u003e echoes the need to find time to work together in the absence of spontaneous in-office brainstorms and hallways chats. Jordan and his team experimented with Zoom working sessions to replicate the experience of working together in a conference room: “Anyone can join, hop on, hop off, and start conversations whenever they want,” Jordan says. Whether teammates have questions, specific discussion topics, or just want to check in on each other, it’s free time for everyone to connect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also recommends scheduling recurring working sessions to collaborate with cross-functional partners. “Work with me” is a two-hour block, a sort of design office hours.

In the world of metal type, when you hold a letter in your hand you also hold its specific font—and so it’s impossible to ask a font to output a letter it has never heard of. But computers put a strange distance between fonts and text. A computer can display text written by someone else, perhaps long ago, and using a font unknown to its creator, or one that might have not even existed when that text was created.

When you copy and paste it, under the hood it remains the original character you wanted to see.

Each further notch is a deeper fallback, and a bigger compromise. You can almost imagine each one coming with a more audible groan of the website\u0026#39;s designer, ceding control from a perfectly manicured, often unique font meant to represent the brand or the emotion of the site, to increasingly more generic fonts—reliable, sure, but not that exciting. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFont fallback has been there \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/#font-family\"\u003esince the very beginning of CSS\u003c/a\u003e, in recognition that there was never a time in our history where every single computer came with the same set of fonts. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOutside of a list of fonts, CSS font fallback didn’t give the web designer more specific control over font fallback: no feedback about which font is ultimately selected, no extra adjustments for size, weight, or letter spacing.

The circle itself is such a universal shape there will be no surprise that it appears over and over again in Unicode: as ◯, and ○, and ◌, and 𝗢, and 𝐎, and 𝖮, and ⚪, and ⥁, and many, many more—and as you can imagine, there are more such simple shapes.

No text you see on your computer is meant only for human eyes. A text that has been “restyled” looks similar, but its actual meaning might be very different. “𝕸𝖆𝖗𝖈𝖎𝖓” will often be impossible to find using search, will make the text impenetrable to people using screen readers (they will announce every letter as “mathematical letter M,” “mathematical letter a” and so on), and… yes, you knew we were heading towards this: it will also be subject to the vagaries of font fallback.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not only that none of the popular fonts contain mathematical symbols or specialized alphabets. Some of the “styles” as seen above also jump between parts of Unicode, letter by letter. And so most of them will fall back to some fonts deep within the system, and since font fallback is so different on different platforms, there’s no way of knowing exactly how any of this will appear on the other side.

All emoji on your computer are usually served by one big font. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut emoji are unique in at least two ways. The first one? They change. A lot. Every year seems to deliver a hundred or so new emoji, and more than a few updates to existing ones. As I write this, the latest version, Emoji 13.0, has been \u003ca href=\"https://blog.emojipedia.org/whats-new-in-unicode-13-0/\"\u003eannounced early in 2020\u003c/a\u003e.

Emoji 13.1 is \u003ca href=\"https://emojipedia.org/emoji-13.1/\"\u003ealready shaping up\u003c/a\u003e with a few contenders such as “heart on fire” and “face in clouds,” and we already know that Emoji 14.0 will be announced in about a year. For typography, familiar with units of time such as millennia, emoji move at unprecedented speed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike every other glyph, emoji follow the rules of font fallback. As you’ve seen above, platforms secretly add an emoji font to the chain. And you could even imagine installing various emoji fonts on your computer, and doing it the traditional way, too:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003efont-family: NotoEmoji, AppleColorEmoji, JoyPixels;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA hypothetical emoji fallback chain prioritizing older emoji files (Noto Sans Emoji) with less emoji coverage results in a strange phenomenon of fallback to a different, newer emoji set (Joy Pixels)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reason you don’t see that often in practice is that emoji fonts—being multicolored, and even sometimes bitmapped—are heavier than even Arial Unicode and Code 2000, and use strange new font formats.

With an open platform, you can easily bring your Figma designs into these tools.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBelow, we’re sharing some recently-launched integrations that make it easier to bring Figma into different stages of your product development process, whether you\u0026#39;re  collecting feedback, collaborating with developers, or looking to quickly take designs to production.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"confluence\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#confluence\"\u003eConfluence\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe recently launched \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-live-figma-embeds/\"\u003eprivate Figma embeds\u003c/a\u003e which allow you to embed live Figma files into tools like Notion, Jira, and Dropbox Paper.

While reflecting on his journey to Figma, he shares his advice for new grads as they think about taking the next step: choosing the right company, finding a role that fits their interests, and making the transition to the working world.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"A92glxScBWfK\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m not going to bury lede here: I graduated from college and went from full-time student to real-world adult faster than you can say “congratulations.” I didn’t know what I was doing as a senior in college when I decided to join Figma — all I knew when I signed the offer letter was that every person I had met at Figma during my onsite was incredibly kind, thoughtful, smart, and seemed genuinely interested in understanding who I was as a person. It was unlike any other interview process. I still remember the discussion I had with the team at the lunch table that day and thinking later on that I couldn’t have had such an honest and open conversation anywhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is basically to say that I can’t in good conscience give you a “why I joined Figma” blog post, not only because it would be disingenuous for me to pretend like I possessed some kind of pre-professional prescience as a senior in college, but also because my intention is not to present my reasoning for joining Figma as authoritative or prescriptive. When I was in school, I found that most of the advice geared toward students for thinking about working life revolved around a set of boxes to check off and assessing companies by the industry heuristics \u003cem\u003edu jour\u003c/em\u003e: interesting problems, smart people, good culture, etc. I imagine that very few people would argue with wanting any of the above, but I don’t think that they can be used as a framework or make the idea of work personally meaningful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe things I’ve learned since joining Figma are certainly valuable, but even more valuable are the questions that I’ve learned to ask about myself and my relationship to work. It’s so easy to get hyper-focused on solutions (after all, problem-solving is supposedly the impetus of engineering as a discipline!) that we forget that there’s so much more power in determining which questions get asked. Rather than giving you a set of boxes to check, I’m going to share a framework for approaching your job search. While it won’t answer all of your questions, it will nudge you to reflect on your non-negotiables and nice-to-haves in a job, and how to think about work in the context of everything else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-mythical-work-life\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-mythical-work-life\"\u003eThe mythical work-life\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think one of the reasons why it’s so difficult to meaningfully talk about adult life (especially about adult working life) is that a lot of the common discourse is so unhelpful. Take, for example, the concept of work-life balance. If the \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=work-life+balance\u0026amp;tbm=isch\"\u003eGoogle image search results\u003c/a\u003e for the term are to be trusted, the common mental model for work-life balance is some kind of teeter-totter on which the directly opposing aspects of work and life are balanced over a fulcrum. While this idea makes intuitive sense, it’s reductive and ultimately misleading.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is true that there is such a thing as achieving a balance between the time that you spend at work and the time you spend outside of work, but framing life and work as two parts of a zero-sum game obscures the very nature of work and life itself. Work and non-work are not two distinct entities that cancel each other out. In fact almost the opposite is true: the hours you spend at work and outside of work amount to how you spend your life. Work and life are interdependent—rather than mutually exclusive—factors that affect not only your life as a whole, but also each other. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome people tie their identity to their work more closely than others, and there’s obviously no right or wrong way to go about doing that. In any case, it would disingenuous to say that you’ve achieved the right work-life balance simply by identifying the right number of hours to spend at work. Work is not a hermetically sealed and timeboxed activity which can be treated as independent from the rest of your life — your satisfaction with the work that you do affects your satisfaction in the rest of your life, and vice versa. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI should acknowledge that no one is in complete control of all the circumstances of their work, and some have even less control than others. Toni Morrison’s essay, “\u003ca href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/05/the-work-you-do-the-person-you-are\"\u003eThe Work You Do, The Person You Are\u003c/a\u003e,” presents a relationship between work and life that stems from a demeaning job she had as a child, and the conclusion, the mantra “Go to work. Get your money. And come on home,” is a reflection of those conditions. It has always been a badge of privilege to be able to think of work as not simply a job but part of a career, and especially in times of economic hardship when employment is by no means a guarantee, a career seems more precious than ever. Regardless of our circumstances, we each face the same question: how do we frame our work relative to our lives in a way that allows us to live the way we want?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor those of us who have the privilege to, this means asking questions like: what kinds of work am I interested in and how does this workplace satisfy those interests? In this work environment, how would I go about learning or developing my interests? Do I see my interests changing, and if so, do I think my work could adapt to accommodate my interests? What skills or crafts does this work afford me the opportunity to develop, and in what ways? What other interests does my work allow me to cultivate?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-more-things-change\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-more-things-change\"\u003eThe more things change\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eJoining Figma as a new grad, I had lots of opportunities to learn new things. There were, of course, the new technical experiences; Figma introduced me to doing full-stack work and writing C++ for the web. But more importantly, I got the opportunity to really own features and participate in the product development process: what it takes to thoughtfully scope and build a feature or product, disambiguate a goal, or take an idea from inception to launch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNone of this would have been possible without the support and guidance of the people around me. The people I’ve worked with have been incredible mentors (in many cases probably without them even realizing) who have given me the opportunity to challenge myself and take ownership for the things I make. Most of the people I ate lunch with at my interview three years ago still work at Figma, and I’m still benefitting from their generosity and expertise. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, the Figma I work at today is different from the company I joined two years ago. Within that time, both the company and the product have grown tremendously, and we’ve started transitioning toward a \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/how-work-is-changing-at-figma/\"\u003ehybrid model\u003c/a\u003e of remote and in-person work. But after all this time, the things that first me excited to come to work continue to be true, and I’ve haven’t stopped learning since I got here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"parting-words\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#parting-words\"\u003eParting words\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI really only have one concrete piece of advice to offer prospective grads: get a hobby. School for me was a blur of fevered activity, constantly running (often literally) from one thing to the next. Working life is starkly simple in comparison, and for the first couple of weeks after work, the question of what to do with my free time stared me in the face. It was one thing to not be used to having so much time to myself, but it was another thing to be clueless about how to use it once I got it back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter all, isn\u0026#39;t free time by its very nature empowering? Invigorating? Life-affirming? Shouldn\u0026#39;t I have felt all the endless potential of my newfound adulthood and independence? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Franz Kafka\u0026#39;s novel \u003cem\u003eAmerika\u003c/em\u003e there\u0026#39;s a scene in which the protagonist, Karl, a European immigrant who has just arrived in America, is being hounded by two swindlers who promise to find him a job but only end up pilfering his belongings and eating his food. At one point he manages to elude them by ducking into the office of a nearby hotel, where Karl encounters a cook who asks him:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;So then you’re free?\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;Yes, I’m free,\u0026#34; said Karl, and nothing seemed more worthless than his freedom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter leaving school, I found in some ways I was more lost than ever. This freedom, however, only felt worthless to me because I wasn’t used to having \u0026#34;nothing\u0026#34; as a thing in itself, and so I perceived it as a lack. As I adjusted to my new life, however, I realized that this freedom is really the \u003cem\u003etabula rasa\u003c/em\u003e on which we begin the long and difficult process of inscribing our own meaning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking for the right hobby is a lot like looking for the right job (with a lot lower stakes): different hobbies afford different experiences (creating, exploring, learning, etc.), and it’s totally up to you to define what you get out of a hobby at any given point in time. Like searching for a job, finding the right hobby isn’t necessarily easy or quick, but don’t sweat it.

Below, we’ve curated some of our favorite takeaways from Config Europe on the importance of trust amongst teammates, with clients, and in the broader design community.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"building-strong-relationships\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#building-strong-relationships\"\u003eBuilding strong relationships\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrust begins with understanding your teammates and connecting with them on a human level. \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/olgasaysstuff\"\u003eOlga Mishyna\u003c/a\u003e, Lead Product Designer at Adyen, suggests that it’s not just about building relationships with immediate teammates, but everyone involved in product development. “To understand what other people think, want, do—or expect you to do—we need to talk to each other,” she says. At Adyen, that can be as simple as making time for brief catch-ups before or after scheduled meetings, or hopping on a quick call instead of problem-solving over email. (If you\u0026#39;re looking for an activity to do with your team, \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/768174747850641472\"\u003ethis toolkit from Dropbox\u003c/a\u003e has some exercises to get the conversation going.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s so much easier to work together once you\u0026#39;ve built a foundation of trust, and that extends to giving and receiving feedback. Designers want to know that feedback in a design crit “comes from a place of care and support,” Olga says. The only way to do that is to build a culture in which team members assume positive intent; if someone doesn’t feel like feedback is coming from a good place, they’re more likely to get defensive. The team at Adyen feel like they can be honest and direct because they’ve invested in getting to know each other, their working styles, and the challenges they face. “Empathy is a very powerful tool,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"embracing-in-progress-work\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#embracing-in-progress-work\"\u003eEmbracing in-progress work\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt design and development agency The Techno Creatives, communication is key. “If you improve your communication skills, you can improve your trust with clients,” says Digital Product Designer \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/daanhekking?lang=en\"\u003eDaan Hekking\u003c/a\u003e. For Daan, it’s about establishing and communicating operating processes with teammates and clients alike. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorking with clients in Figma can take some getting used to. Once a client has access to a file, they can follow along as the designs evolve. While these real-time updates are helpful for keeping everyone on the same page (literally), it can also be scary to get feedback on early explorations. When collaborating in one file, Daan urges the team to “treat it delicately and set rules.” This means asking designers to be clear on where they are in the design process (with \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/823272326227655373\"\u003estatus annotations\u003c/a\u003e, for example), whether or not input is welcome, and if so, the altitude of feedback they need to move forward. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince design is iterative by nature and work evolves constantly, keeping clients and the internal team up to date is key: “Make sure that your doc reflects the current state of the project,” Daan says. As you think about establishing these types of operating rules on your team, \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/826849235179549507\"\u003ethis file from Mixpanel\u003c/a\u003e is a great place to start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"opening-the-dialogue\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#opening-the-dialogue\"\u003eOpening the dialogue\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond the day-to-day work, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/yessshir\"\u003eShirley Lai\u003c/a\u003e, Product Designer at Rakuten Viki, hopes that teams can have open conversations about the bigger picture as well. Shirley created \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/877214754445470023\"\u003eThe Designated Dissenter\u003c/a\u003e card game to empower everyone—regardless of role or seniority—to speak up about design ethics and the role of technology. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBroken up into “stakeholders,” “values,” and “discussion,” the game assigns a “dissenter,” whose job is to object and oppose what others on the team say. “It’s a way to get to know your team better and foster an open feedback culture,” Shirley says. And more importantly, it’ll get the team to think about the “larger consequences” of what they’re building, on a more foundational level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"ed4LDaqfKSYX\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuilding trust with colleagues and clients won’t happen overnight, but taking time to get to know one another, establish clear processes, and have honest conversations with your team will set you on the right path.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re curious to hear more from Config Europe, subscribe to \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQsVmhSa4X-G3lHlUtejzLA\"\u003eFigma’s YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e to get notified when we publish all of the breakout sessions.

      "content_html": "\u003cdiv id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a natural tension between design and code. In the world of design, the focus is deciding what to build—in the world of code, the focus is building it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTraditionally, designers and developers have occupied different worlds, requiring separate tools. In practice, they’re partners working to bring a product to life. While their approaches may differ, each offer unique advantages. Designers optimize for freeform, creative exploration, while developers take a more structured approach. The result is an inevitable tension between the two: what feels like “breaking” a component to a developer is just creative exploration to a designer; what reads as “structure” to a developer might be inhibiting to a designer. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe believe in embracing concepts from engineering and design, adopting the rigor and reusability of code while preserving the rapid iteration and uninhibited exploration that makes visual design so powerful. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt \u003ca href=\"https://config.figma.com/\"\u003eConfig Europe\u003c/a\u003e this morning, we announced several new features that will carry the best of both worlds to design systems in Figma—bringing them closer to code and making them intuitive to use, while more efficiently translating designs into production.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"supporting-design-systems-that-mirror-your-code\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#supporting-design-systems-that-mirror-your-code\"\u003eSupporting design systems that mirror your code base\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeams typically maintain a set of components for design, and one for development. While this is a normal and good approach, straddling both worlds isn’t always easy. When code and design components mirror each other, teams can move much more efficiently. Today, we announced Variants, Interactive Components, and improvements to Auto Layout that will allow teams to do just that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"bridging-code-and-design-components-with-variants\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#bridging-code-and-design-components-with-variants\"\u003eBridging code and design components with Variants (coming in November)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA single component in front-end code typically renders in a number of visual styles, for different contexts and states of user interaction. For example, a button might have primary and secondary styles, small and large sizes, and different versions for iOS and Android. Currently, a button component like this would be represented by different components, each for a different visual style. This mismatch between design and code can result in miscommunication, ultimately slowing down the development process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo solve this problem, we’re launching \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055471353-Prepare-for-Variants\"\u003eVariants\u003c/a\u003e, a way to logically group together variations of the same component into a single, more powerful component. In addition to simplifying the asset panel, this update will allow components to map more closely to code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"drag-and-drop-interactive-components-into\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#drag-and-drop-interactive-components-into\"\u003eDrag and drop Interactive Components into prototypes (launching in January)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that you’re able to group a component’s interactive states together with Variants, you may be wondering whether or not these interactive states work with your prototypes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Variants let us group a component’s states together, prototyping the transitions between these states in Figma today still requires a lot of work. Just to create the illusion of an interactive object, designers would have to connect multiple frames with overlays.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInteractive Components make prototyping much more efficient by letting designers add prototyping interactions between Variants, so instances are immediately “alive” in prototyping mode. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"design-like-you-code-with-auto-layout-coming-in\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#design-like-you-code-with-auto-layout-coming-in\"\u003eDesign like you code with Auto Layout (coming in November)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe introduction of Auto Layout in 2019 brought layout rules to Figma. By allowing designers to make updates to button text without manually adjusting frame size, Auto Layout empowers them to more easily create responsive interfaces. But we knew we had more work ahead of us to bring Auto Layout even closer to how the CSS \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp\"\u003ebox model\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/\"\u003eFlexbox\u003c/a\u003e work on the Web. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn our next evolution, we’re bringing a simplified UI to Auto Layout so it’s even easier to use, plus new features based on some of our most frequent requests: the ability to stretch elements along both axes, configure independent padding values, and optimize spacing for common UI patterns like navigation icons.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"making-design-systems-more-accessible-at-scale\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#making-design-systems-more-accessible-at-scale\"\u003eMaking design systems more accessible at scale\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to making design systems more powerful, we’ve added features that help both designers and developers navigate large, complex libraries. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re navigating thousands of components, finding the right one was previously a clunky experience in Figma. You’d have to remember the exact component name or scan a giant list. In addition to Variants, which will reduce the number of components designers need to look through, we’ve overhauled the \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039150413\"\u003eInstance Swap Menu\u003c/a\u003e so that it scales with your design system.

The new \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055203533\"\u003eInspect Tab\u003c/a\u003e replaces the Code panel and provides more relevant properties developers can grab. The name of the selected layer is shown right at the top to help designers and developers get on the same page about what’s being implemented. And there are new sections showing relevant values for Variants, Colors, Shadows, Content, Typography, Borders, and more. It also lets developers click to copy any value to their clipboard—including whole snippets of key:value pairs—so they can easily paste things into code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"SLX2X-_73bWN\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese updates are just the start of how we envision bringing design and code closer together in Figma. There are times when a designer needs a free and unrestrained canvas to work in, and there are times when a more structured code-inspired approach is the fastest way for a designer to work. We imagine a world where designers can move smoothly between those two ways of working as they see fit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

The program, which focuses on the interplay between design, technology, and entrepreneurship, invites students to take on design strategy clients for all four years and culminates in seniors running their own startups. Since presenting is a large part of both client-facing work and startup-building, Abigail spent the first three years of college refining her presentation skills in front of a variety of audiences: toy designers, vehicle inventors, entertainment executives, and more. Below, she shares her tips for developing and delivering a presentation that lands.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"r8Oc6w4KX0Ul\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn the first day of college, the dean of my program brought all the freshmen to hear from a Silicon Valley Bank investor, then informed us that we’d be presenting to him immediately after. With just an hour to prepare a pitch on Pet Rocks, I did what was familiar: cited market statistics, researched the history of the toy, and made what I thought were a few clever points about how nostalgia drives sales. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNo dice. The investor smiled blankly and moved on to the next presentation, crowning a group of my classmates as the winners. \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s pretty simple,\u0026#34; he said. \u0026#34;Some of you created apps to accompany the Pet Rocks, and some of you pitched big marketing campaigns. Only one group told a story.\u0026#34; \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI used to think that storytelling was reserved for social situations, like making my friends laugh or carrying the conversation at a dinner party. In spending the last three years presenting my ideas to design clients and preparing to pitch a startup, I know now that storytelling also has an important place in my coursework and the professional world.  Whether you’re presenting in class, running a team meeting, or looking for a new job, great storytelling can help you present clear ideas, pitch solutions to complex problems, or carry an interview. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile many of us assume that storytelling is an innate ability, I’ve since learned that it’s a skill that you can refine and perfect over time.

Building trust is central to making an audience think, act, or feel differently, and to do that, you have to show your audience that you understand them. Here are some questions that I try to answer as I prepare presentations:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat do they care about? Consider their challenges, needs, and goals.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhy are they listening to your pitch?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat do they have to gain?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow do they communicate?

To that end, I learn everything I can about who might be in the room, articulate a problem statement that resonates with them, and introduce the solution.

Here are some considerations:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEvery piece of imagery either contributes or distracts from your main story, so make sure that your images add meaning, not decoration. A common example of decorative imagery is iconography. While it\u0026#39;s easy to gravitate toward icons because they\u0026#39;re so present in everyday UI, remember that no one is clicking on anything in a pitch deck.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTake advantage of free design resources and \u003ca href=\"https://unsplash.com/\"\u003efree-use photography\u003c/a\u003e.

Just make sure to give credit, either by adding a caption, linking to the resource  somewhere on  your slide, or dedicating a slide at the end of your deck to citations.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDepending on your audience, they may respond well to edgier imagery. Think: memes, pop culture references, and screenshots of news articles can all work. Just make sure that your references are relevant, and when in doubt, err on the side of caution—it’s not worth alienating or offending anyone in the audience for the sake of a meme.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"color\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#color\"\u003eColor\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn most cases, sparingly used accent colors can add polish to your slides. You can use color to highlight specific words or data points, or to help tell your story in more subtle ways: In one presentation, I changed background colors gradually to parallel an evolving concept. I\u0026#39;ve also used accent and background colors to separate topics from one another. In some cases, decks look better with a shocking amount of color in them. Be creative and have fun with color, but make sure it doesn\u0026#39;t interfere with readability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"visualizing-data\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#visualizing-data\"\u003eVisualizing data\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFacts and figures can offer powerful supporting points. Just remember to present them in context of the broader story. As you think about what data to include, prioritize data that can be represented visually, like growth over time.

Over time, you\u0026#39;ll get better at reading people, and adapting your storytelling style accordingly.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePractice being precise with your words, even if it means an awkward mid-sentence pause as you find the right phrase.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"consume-great-storytelling-regularly\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#consume-great-storytelling-regularly\"\u003eConsume great storytelling regularly\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSeek out great storytellers in podcasts, TED talks, books, and publications. Hearing from professional storytellers—writers, journalists, podcast hosts—can help you refine pacing, intonation, and structure. I like podcasts that focus on intimate storytelling (like \u003ca href=\"https://thememorypalace.us/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Memory Palace\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e or \u003ca href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/469516571/modern-love\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eModern Love\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e) and publications that distill complex ideas into clear and concise writing (like \u003ca href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Atlantic\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe New York Times\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"keep-track-of-things-well-said-and-things-well\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#keep-track-of-things-well-said-and-things-well\"\u003eKeep track of things well said and things well presented\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eI collect my favorite sentences and phrases in a Notion page.

Today, I’m excited to announce that Figma is opening a hub office in London, which will serve as our HQ for the EMEA region. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKnowing that so many of us (including everyone at Figma) will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future, we considered waiting to share the news until we felt comfortable welcoming Figmates back for in-person work. But the reality is that opening an office is so much more than a physical space. It’s also about sharing a time zone with more of our users, attracting diverse talent as Figma continues to grow, and understanding local nuances in order to support design communities across the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we launched Figma in 2016, I was shocked at the global nature of our user base — 81% of Figma’s weekly active users are outside the United States!

When done well, design systems enable consistency and efficiency; as so many of us continue to work remotely, it’s more important than ever to get everyone on the same page. We\u0026#39;ve curated some of the highlights from the livestream that apply to remote work and beyond. Check out the video:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"dhVcNz8xsn4j\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesign systems have come a long way from pattern libraries and sticker sheets. Now, they\u0026#39;re living systems with code counterparts, and they’ve really changed how we do our work for the better. Beyond providing consistency by creating a set of standard designs and components, they empower teams to move faster and more efficiently. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"flexibility-not-rigidity\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#flexibility-not-rigidity\"\u003eFlexibility, not rigidity\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince design systems can be a single source of truth for your team, it can be tempting to come up with a set of hard and fast rules around not only what goes into your design system, but also how to use it. While it’s important to provide a solid structure, being too prescriptive can impede creativity, and ultimately might make designers feel like they need to go outside of the system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/MCapoz\"\u003eMae Capozzi\u003c/a\u003e, a former Senior Software Engineer at Harry’s, it\u0026#39;s about \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuKjwceTvDM\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u0026amp;t=3080\"\u003etrading complexity for flexibility\u003c/a\u003e. The team at Harry’s does that by building in layers, which are architected from least complex and least flexible (e.g. base components) to most complex and most flexible (e.g. starter kit), allowing designers to build something more standard or to explore a new approach. While the simple layers suffice for most projects, others will require something more custom, which the design system can flex to support. By defaulting to simple while allowing for more complicated builds, the system optimizes for efficiency and ensures that designers don’t feel the need to leave the system. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince Condé Nast oversee publications like \u003cem\u003eVogue\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eThe New Yorker\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eBon Appétit\u003c/em\u003e, it’s crucial that their design system can flex to the needs of different brands. \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/codingdesigner?lang=en\"\u003eMason Wendell\u003c/a\u003e, frontend developer at Condé Nast says the team does this by building \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuKjwceTvDM\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u0026amp;t=1570\"\u003emodular, adaptable components\u003c/a\u003e through a token system.

The team has built a custom plugin that allows for importing and exporting changes to token values in JSON format. Mason says that this token system allows the team to “\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuKjwceTvDM\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u0026amp;t=2316\"\u003estand up a new market quickly\u003c/a\u003e,” and ensures a smooth handoff between designers and engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it doesn’t have to be complex. Mason says that if you \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/tuKjwceTvDM?t=2733\"\u003edon’t have multiple brands\u003c/a\u003e, you can at least start by associating “a purpose with a value.” Whether it’s colors or typography, doing so will give you a sense of how complex your system is. “By settling on names and values, that gives you some perspective on how complex—or overly-complex—your design system might currently be.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAbove all, it’s important to build a system and processes that work best for your team’s size, structure, and priorities.

A common misconception I often hear is that enterprise product roadmaps are always dictated top-down: customers request something, and we build it. In reality, developing a product that scales well, supports a wide range of customers, and delivers a delightful experience is so much more complex (and interesting!) than just shipping the most recent request. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma’s enterprise product team develops tooling that helps Organization admins manage their accounts and ensure that designers, developers, and collaborators have the access they need. Day to day, that involves joining sales calls with prospective clients to learn about their needs, meeting with existing customers to gather feedback, and partnering with stakeholders across marketing, engineering, and design to build cohesive solutions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"our-complex-and-interesting-work\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#our-complex-and-interesting-work\"\u003eOur complex (and interesting!) work\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince launching \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/organization/\"\u003eFigma Organization\u003c/a\u003e in early 2019, Figma’s usage within our existing customers has grown immensely. Especially in our new remote world, it’s more important than ever for everyone involved in the product development process to be on the same page, and we often see that happening in Figma. But as more and more collaborators join Figma to participate and contribute to their company’s design process, the scope of an Organization admin’s work in Figma broadens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma’s original Admin Settings console was designed before we knew what tooling would be most valuable to admins. Now, over a year into the product’s life, we’ve learned a lot more about who our customers are and what they need. Through conversations with customers, support, and sales, we started to understand what worked well, what didn’t, and what admins need to efficiently do their jobs. It became clear that our customers had outgrown the Admin Settings\u0026#39; original design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, we set out to redesign it.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"starting-from-first-principles\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#starting-from-first-principles\"\u003eStarting from first principles\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe knew that Figma worked well for designers, but for admins who manage their team’s day-to-day operation, there was room for improvement. We decided to reimagine Figma for our admin users, optimize their member management workflows, highlight existing functionality, and leave room to allow us to more easily build new features in the future. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith those goals in mind, we decided to run a brainstorm with the team, categorizing ideas into “Do now,” “Worth considering,” and “Wild \u0026amp; crazy.” We invited the working group: PM \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/benstern0?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"\u003eBen Stern\u003c/a\u003e, engineering manager \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/twright0/\"\u003eThomas Wright\u003c/a\u003e, designer \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanhsu/\"\u003eJordan Hsu\u003c/a\u003e, engineers \u003ca href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshtabak/\"\u003eJosh Tabak\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/stanhuan\"\u003eStanley Huang\u003c/a\u003e, in addition to many other cross-functional partners from the research, data, support, marketing, and sales teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMarketing offered design ideas, product shared feedback on research, and engineers wrote suggestions for UX. We couldn’t have generated such a diverse list of ideas without everyone on board, and even though everyone came from a different perspective, we were excited to see common themes emerge. To synthesize input, we grouped related ideas into those main themes. Then, Ben mapped suggestions to the user feedback that we received, and derived a shortlist of priorities. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=387\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe enterprise team’s initial brainstorm session in Figma\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the brainstorm, we wondered how to scope this project. Should it be a simple UI update or a larger overhaul? Initially, we thought we might be able to layer different views and options onto our existing Admin Settings. But when we partnered with the sales team to better understand points of friction, we heard that admins didn’t have enough information to make good decisions at true-up, weren’t aware of the features most relevant to them, and were exporting information manually. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe design of the Admin Settings view was limiting the value any individual feature could provide; redesigning it to optimize for certain key workflows would allow us to not only add new features easily, but also make better use of the features we had previously built. Instead of just addressing the symptom, Ben advocated for turning this workstream into a full product update. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"building-for-scale\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#building-for-scale\"\u003eBuilding for scale\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike enterprise companies that are enterprise-only (and often only build for companies with a certain number of employees or functions), Figma supports organizations of all sizes. Beyond providing a better user experience for admins and end users alike, developing a tool that scales well is central to what we do. To us, that means creating a strong foundation that also gives us the flexibility to add and update features as user needs evolve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile all product development requires a deep understanding of buyers, stakeholders, and end users, enterprise work demands insights into not just individuals and their challenges, but also broader organizational dynamics. Figma needs to flex to fit teams of 5 or 5,000—one person might play many roles that span admin responsibilities, design ops, and individual design work at smaller organizations, whereas enterprise companies often dedicate entire teams to each function. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, a VP-level budget-holder needs to understand the value of the product across their organization; someone from design ops needs to ensure teams have the necessary permissions and access to resources; security teams need peace of mind that their organization\u0026#39;s data is secure. On top of that, each individual user has unique requirements, motivations, and challenges for using the product every day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo end users, an organization’s admin tooling is likely an afterthought. But for admins, settings are central to their day-to-day work; it’s where they get crucial visibility over account usage, access security controls, and manage team members. We realized that some of the confusion came from non-admins accessing information that they didn’t need. Similarly, admins were seeing prompts to create files and view designs in teams and projects, which were more tailored to non-admin workflows. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?rect=2,0,2876,1640\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=382\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eBefore the redesign: anyone in the organization could access a list of all the members\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, we decided to remove admin-only pages for non-admins and build a new top-level navigation option that separates the Admin Settings view from the broader Organization page—which any Organization member can see—and paths to design creation and consumption (like drafts and teams).

Aside from more clear and robust filters and sorting mechanisms to help admins manage members, admins frequently request an intuitive shift+click behavior to quickly select many members at once. This behavior would allow them to more easily perform bulk actions like copying emails for a subset of members, or modifying many users’ permissions at once. We knew we wanted to incorporate this into the Admin Settings refresh. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we decided what to build, Jordan got to work on a design spec and shared his early thinking with the team. At many companies, a design spec will tell you exactly what to implement, and a high fidelity prototype oftentimes matches the exact user experience we want to achieve. While Jordan’s designs were nothing short of incredible, they left room for discussion rather than specifying implementation decisions to a tee. On the enterprise product team—and this is true of work across Figma—we like to invite early feedback. Instead of work feeling like a handoff from one person to the next, we approach it more as an open discussion. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJordan’s designs specified polished click-targets and selection and hover states, but functionalities like how users actually select many rows, add to their selections, and deselect were left undefined. While Josh and Stanley were ultimately responsible for development on this project, they took the initiative to conduct informal research to see how other tools support bulk selection. In looking at Asana, Gmail, and other tools, they found that multi-selection and deselection using shift+click could be implemented in a variety of ways. They aggregated their research and came up with a proposal for what they wanted to implement, optimizing not only for feasibility and reusability, but also for an intuitive, enjoyable user experience. They received great feedback from our team (and more importantly, our users!), and we shipped it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?rect=1,0,4049,2484\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=411\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFeedback on an early prototype of how multi-selection would work in the redesigned Admin Settings\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is just one example of how people at Figma are given the opportunity and encouraged to take on different roles and help make product decisions beyond their formal job description.

Figma is built on an unconventional stack—like our \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/\"\u003eCTO Evan shared\u003c/a\u003e, we essentially made “a browser inside a browser.” Our design editor is powered by \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/\"\u003eWebGL\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/\"\u003eWebAssembly\u003c/a\u003e, with some of the user interface implemented in Typescript and React. Unlike most static interfaces built in React, comments are dynamic, and they can pan and zoom as part of the canvas. As you scroll around the canvas, we anchor your comment to something we call a comment pin, which ensures that your feedback stays exactly where you want it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo do so, we need to get constant viewport updates from our editor. The viewport updates are stored in Redux and retrieved by the comment components. Each comment pin component uses this information to calculate where the comment pins should be rendered on the canvas in relation to the viewport.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"getting-to-the-bottom-of-slow-performance\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#getting-to-the-bottom-of-slow-performance\"\u003eGetting to the bottom of slow performance\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn order to improve performance on this particular view, we needed to identify what was slowing it down.

About 68ms per frame is spent on JS on a page with 30 comments and only a small port of the computing time per frame is spent on rendering and painting. Scripting refers to JS events and event handlers; rendering and painting have to do with the translation of HTML elements to displayable on-screen elements. It’s promising that most improvement could be done on the JS and React optimization, but we still needed to understand more of what’s happening under the hood of rendering the comment components in React.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?rect=0,0,2944,2056\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=468\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eChrome performance tool shows we spent the majority of time on scripting and rendered the comments view at 19fps with 30 comment threads\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe used React Profiler to pinpoint which components were actually re-rendering. React profile shows that only about 1.8ms is spent rendering the comments view. This re-rendering is necessary because its content is changing. However, from the React Profile, we observed that a lot of time was consumed rendering many fixed position components like the left panel, toolbar view, and properties panel. But intuitively, only the comment should care about the viewport change, not these fixed components. The biggest inefficiency that creeps in as React applications grow is needlessly re-rendering components, which is exactly what we observed.

We found that Redux runs every single middleware and loops through and runs mapsStateToProps for every connected component, each time an action is dispatched. It then passes all of the data down through multiple layers to the comments view. But in our case, the only thing that should need this is the comments view. We had instances where we were passing in anonymous functions to force the components to render over and over again. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"our-approach\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#our-approach\"\u003eOur approach\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo fix the unnecessary re-rendering, we decided to remove viewport information from our Redux store and instead implemented our own \u003ca href=\"https://css-tricks.com/understanding-event-emitters/\"\u003eevent emitter\u003c/a\u003e in our React codebase to broadcast this piece of information. We switched over from old components to functional components and, using React Hooks—which enabled us to memorize expensive computation—we now only do them when information changes. By avoiding dispatching an action to update viewport information in Redux, we successfully stopped running mapStateToProps for every connected component and avoided passing all of the data down through multiple layers to the comments view. As a result, we essentially prevented other components that don’t need ViewportInfo from re-rendering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"better-but-not-quite-there\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#better-but-not-quite-there\"\u003eBetter, but not quite there\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this point, we ran the Chrome performance tool and React Profiler again. We saw that the constant re-rendering had stopped and the frame rate of comment view had significantly improved from 15fps to 50fps with 50 comment pins. However, we still weren’t quite at our goal of 60fps. We also observed that performance linearly degrades with the increasing number of comment pins. So, we still had work ahead of us. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"o-n-operation-on-every-viewport-change\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#o-n-operation-on-every-viewport-change\"\u003eO(n) operation on every viewport change\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTJ Pavlu, an engineer on my team, worked with me on further improvements. By observing how the comment pins move on the document level, we noticed that every comment pin performs a transform action when viewport moves. Each of the comment pin components was recomputing its pin position and performing a transform-style action with each viewport change (which you’ll see in the screen recording below). In turn, comments view triggers an 0(n) operation, where n is the number of comment threads as we pan and zoom. This might seem trivial for files with just a few comments, but the more comments there are, the slower the operation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eWith every viewport change, each of the comment pin components recomputed its pin position and performed a transform-style action\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe came up with the solution to create an overlay container on the canvas and then to position the comment pins statically on this container. From there, we repositioned the overlay container (one computation) using CSS translate instead of doing so with each comment pin (n computations) as the viewport moves (illustrated in the second screen recording). Now, every viewport change triggers an O(1) operation instead of O(n) operation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eOnly the overlay parent component recomposes its position on viewport changes\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe created this overlay container by creating a box around the most top-left pin and the most bottom-right pin. This means every time a new comment is added, we have to recompute this top-left/bottom-right boundary box. This tradeoff is worth it because a) comments are added less often than panning around the canvas and b) this boundary box calculation happens when the canvas isn’t moving.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"better-performance-not-perfection\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#better-performance-not-perfection\"\u003eBetter performance, not perfection\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBased on how we scoped the project—achieving 60fps for files with up to 150 comments—it was a success.

The typical signs of fall are beginning to appear, with small twists: the USC Target has dusted off their \u003cem\u003eWelcome back, students!\u003c/em\u003e banner, and shipments of cheap microwaves and white plastic storage bins have taken over most of the store. People mill around them cautiously. Professors have again begun emailing students about the coming semester, but in place of the usual decisive messages about materials and policies have come gentle reminders that everyone should maintain a flexible mindset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt seems like everyone is trying to stay open-minded, but it’s still hard for me to muster this much flexibility. I’ve spent the past three years constructing a vision of my final year in my major program, where my senior capstone involves pitching, running, and growing a startup. Beyond that, I still have several GE’s to finish and leadership positions to fill on campus. My instinct is to clench my fists and find every opportunity to preserve that vision. I know that many people reading this letter can’t quite square with the idea of a remote year yet, either—especially if that means going without the nights spent huddled around one computer, experimenting side-by-side in our makerspace, or trying on new skills making hardware, recording podcasts, or shooting videos, just to see if we enjoy it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNaturally, there has been a lot of conversation about our plans for the fall. From what I can tell, at least a third of my program is taking classes from their high school bedrooms. Students without a scholarship are frustrated with the expectation to pay for a degree delivered over Zoom. Some of us are taking classes from the USC area (we’re paying rent, anyway). My international friends have little choice about whether to return, not willing to jeopardize their visas. And I and a few others have been whispering about a gap year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"whispers-of-a-gap-year\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#whispers-of-a-gap-year\"\u003eWhispers of a gap year\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I brought up my gap year a few weeks ago at home, my whole family recoiled. My parents kept recycling similar lines of critical questioning, which always ended at, “Why not just finish?” I sat on the couch, grasping at arguments to make. “You can go back to your job next year,” my dad said. “What makes you think you’ll want to go back to school next fall? You could be taking online classes then, too. A gap year just makes it easier for you to not finish.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI went to get a drink from the kitchen. My grandmother, who was cutting fruit, grabbed my face with two hands and whispered, “Just finish. You are almost done.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI didn’t have great answers to their questions, at least none that I explained well that day. The simple, unfiltered, rationale for delaying my senior year is three-prong. First, I\u0026#39;d rather be at school when I can invest my time richly—in community, in my classes, in my extracurriculars. Second, if I have access to a fulfilling job in a pandemic, it makes sense to work for a year to build up my savings, so I don’t have to work part-time or search for a job during such an uncertain period. Third, I could benefit from extended experience at a startup if I wanted to run my own some day. But this wasn\u0026#39;t enough. \u003cstrong\u003eI couldn’t quite address their other pressing concern—that taking time off meant raising my chances of never returning and never getting my degree. In retrospect, this was probably their most fundamental fear. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo me and to many of my friends, gap years and dropouts are aspirational—that someone may be so bold, so unique, so extraordinary that they’re all but excused from finishing their degrees. Instead of coursework, we think, we, too, could start building the next unicorn. To my family, however, no one is excused from education. In their minds, education is not only the ladder, but the sole path to success, and it is to be climbed rung by rung, with unwavering discipline and focus. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll four of my grandparents immigrated in the 70\u0026#39;s, leaving behind careers as a lawyer, shipping merchant, banker, and nurse. They each took up multiple minimum-wage jobs, supporting my parents until they could get degrees at American universities. In turn, my parents took great care to invest everything they could into my education. They were conservative spenders. We didn’t take grand vacations. Instead, they paid for my education. I understood this and worked hard at school; it was clear that learning was always the priority. Eventually, I got into USC with a full merit scholarship. My mom still sends me links to graduate programs, a path I lost interest in a few years ago. Time off does not compute.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe conversations I’ve been having with friends about whether or not to return to school have been practical, social, and economic: what’s the real cost of going back this fall? Of taking time off? What will I do without my community? How do you think employers will see a gap year? What is the value of a degree, anyway? While there are hard truths about the price of education, the answers to these questions are different for everyone. The biggest one I’ve been grappling with is cultural: do any of these answers change for me as a woman of color?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"my-place-in-silicon-valley\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#my-place-in-silicon-valley\"\u003eMy place in Silicon Valley?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere has long been a kind of “dropout mythology” in tech—that Silicon Valley glorifies the (usually) Ivy League and (all-too-often) male founder. While it’s a story I’ve grown used to, it’s not one I’ve seen myself reflected in. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m interning this summer at a startup that I care about deeply, and that is taking good care of me. It makes me optimistic that the archetype of the Silicon Valley dropout is gradually opening up, making way for more people like me. It suddenly seems possible that if I never went back to school at all, I could continue to get jobs that I’m meant for, with employers who value me for my merit, and where I’ll excel as long as I work hard. I hold onto this view with a loose grip, hoping this will eventually be the whole truth. But I’ve seen that time and time again, in talking to friends and looking up to heroes, meritocracy is often tangled up in so many concepts—representation, privilege, opportunity—that can weigh heavy on women who look like me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;Predicting who will succeed is an imperfect art. And parts of it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. When venture capitalists say—and they do say—“We think it’s young white men, ideally Ivy League dropouts, who are the safest bets,” and then only invest in young white men with Ivy League backgrounds, of course young white men with Ivy League backgrounds are the only ones who make money for them (they also are the only ones who lose money for them, but who’s keeping track of that?).\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e-Ellen Pao, from her book, \u003cem\u003eReset\u003c/em\u003e, on her time at Kleiner Perkins\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m a Filipino woman. Leaving school is a risk. Not having a degree could be an obstacle. I love school; part of the reason I\u0026#39;m taking time off to work is to preserve my chances of getting to do school in person eventually. But even entertaining the gap year this way is a privilege. I know that most people can\u0026#39;t just flip the switch on enrollment, so I’m humbled to be in the position where it’s a realistic (read: financially feasible) option. Without my scholarship and my job, I wouldn\u0026#39;t be asking these questions at all. But what about my first generation and Black and Latinx peers? Do they get the luxury of deciding that they don’t need the university label to be considered for jobs if they don’t like the way their senior year is looking? \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"seeking-wisdom\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#seeking-wisdom\"\u003eSeeking wisdom\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eI took my uncertainty about plans for fall to my mentors. My current boss at Primer, Ryan Delk, gave me a new set of questions to ask, the most straightforward being, “Where are you going to grow more in a year?” This question has echoed around my mind frequently over the last few weeks. I feel strongly that for me, the answer isn\u0026#39;t in \u003cem\u003eremote classes\u003c/em\u003e. But what if I\u0026#39;m wrong? \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI called on my previous boss, Camille Ricketts, Notion’s resident wordsmith and general marketing mastermind. “How do you think about regret? What about risk? Self-confidence?” I asked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I wish I had taken far bigger risks earlier in my career,” she told me. “The stakes only get higher as the years go by, and suddenly you find yourself unable to make a radical move or explore something very different. You have too many responsibilities, or your experience has become too specific and focused. Early on is the time to be an energetic and ambitious generalist and get a lot of exposure to many things. Before age 30 is the time to try things that seem scary, or maybe even illogical. Do the things that you love, that inspire you, that you can’t get out of your head, that you find yourself working on or thinking about even when you’re tired or outside of your main work. Looking back now, I had so much optionality and I closed doors for arbitrary reasons. Try a lot of things.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd in the long run?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Don’t worry about your long-term earning potential. If you’re good at something you love, the money will truly follow. I’ve seen it happen for so many of my peers. It sounds cliche, but I think it’s very important to keep in mind.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"more-voices\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#more-voices\"\u003eMore voices\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the 10,000 ft view, this becomes more than a conversation about COVID-specific gap years and moves squarely into considerations about the value of education more broadly. Dylan, who left college to start Figma, offered to bring in other perspectives alongside his own. We invited a small handful of people we knew would be thoughtful on the topic to chat with Dylan over Zoom: \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/SyX6RZJVl3w\"\u003eLaura Deming\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/5JXdv9IMB9Q\"\u003eJohn Maeda\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s1xyZM-2Gw\u0026amp;list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG\u0026amp;index=6\u0026amp;t=31s\"\u003eMarc Andreessen\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s1xyZM-2Gw\u0026amp;list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG\u0026amp;index=5\u0026amp;t=0s\"\u003eJeff Weiner\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/IKrgpvWrQAU\"\u003eKarlie Kloss\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/MWVUEJSh7bo\"\u003eMay-Li Khoe\u003c/a\u003e.

I let their words sink in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI watched \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/SyX6RZJVl3w\"\u003eLaura’s interview\u003c/a\u003e first. As she talked to Dylan, it was clear that she knew what she wanted out of her education from the start. Each time she changed paths—from Cynthia Kenyon\u0026#39;s lab, to MIT, to the Thiel Fellowship—she was making a decision to learn in a new, rich way. As I played her interview in my room at USC, I felt that it was valid to pursue the exact education I want right now, even if it comes in the form of working at a startup. May-Li’s words echoed more of the same: “Everything that I have worked on has been another part of my education.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, everyone we interviewed agreed that companies shouldn\u0026#39;t require college degrees. Degrees are not a factor in \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/_s1xyZM-2Gw?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG\u0026amp;t=2914\"\u003eMarc\u0026#39;s decisions about who to fund\u003c/a\u003e.

For Laura, Ivy League degrees are \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/SyX6RZJVl3w?t=1067\"\u003ean anti-signal\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0026#39;s safe to say that the value of the degree is changing, but maybe not quickly enough for me to abandon mine outright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn his interview, Jeff echoed a lot of what Camille had to say—\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/kzqPXaPMgCs?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG\u0026amp;t=1401\"\u003efind the sweet spot\u003c/a\u003e between what you\u0026#39;re good at and what you love. I\u0026#39;m good at what I do for work, and I love being at school. Maybe it\u0026#39;s not such a wild idea to take a year off to work so I can save that fourth year of learning for a better time. This might not be exactly what Jeff meant, but it feels right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI take comfort in the fact that John dealt with \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/5JXdv9IMB9Q?t=659\"\u003esimilarly conflicting advice\u003c/a\u003e from his idol, Paul Rand, who told him to use money from work to fund passions. And that, \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/_s1xyZM-2Gw?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG\u0026amp;t=433\"\u003eaccording to Marc\u003c/a\u003e, I picked my educational path right; a practical degree from a top school that unlocked me a world of (well-paid) professional opportunities. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m afraid of sounding like someone who peaked in college, but I\u0026#39;m not ready to tie off the things I\u0026#39;ve been building with my friends at USC, namely USC\u0026#39;s undergraduate entrepreneurial community and a physical space that reflects the diversity of that community. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI listened to \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKrgpvWrQAU\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\"\u003eKarlie\u0026#39;s interview\u003c/a\u003e last. She spoke about the voice in her head reminding her that even when she had everything going in her career, without having had the college experience, she felt like something was missing. The inverse seems true for me, and I think that\u0026#39;s okay. “Listen to yourself,” she said. “You have the answer.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted to take time off.

The ideas I hold about personal growth or education, even when bolstered by these thoughtful and successful people, don’t factor into the investment my family has already made in my education.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was resolved to go back to school to avoid another stressful debate, but then I played back the raw recording of John’s interview, and I had to put down my Trader Joe\u0026#39;s Apple Blossoms and replay something he said halfway through. “\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/5JXdv9IMB9Q?t=1760\"\u003eCalculate the ROI\u003c/a\u003e.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd while it’s nearly impossible to quantify the ways their lives had to change to make mine possible, there was some math I knew I could do. So, I did what Jeff (and Marc, and John) recommended—I literally wrote out the numbers: the amount I’d make in my year off, what that could cover, incorporating my student loans, a car, rent for next year, and savings. I sent it to my mom and waited. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a long silence.

Grief is not linear and we all move through it in different ways. Some of us have processed the situation we are in and are ready for what’s next. Others are adapting to this new world. And some of us are still in denial, comforted by the hope that our pre-COVID lives could return at any moment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHXmj3hN5mI\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\u0026amp;t=184\"\u003etime passes by\u003c/a\u003e, it’s clear work and life are changing in significant ways. COVID-19 has weakened the network effects of cities across the world. More and more people are winding down their overpriced leases and moving elsewhere to save money or be near loved ones. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese trends, along with Figmate feedback, motivated us to make some big changes. Once offices are safe to open again, we’re moving towards a hybrid model, where we offer both in-person and remote work options. This is a departure from the mostly in-person approach we had before COVID. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe took an employee-centric approach to this decision, using an internal survey to inform our plan. Many companies are grappling with similar choices, so in the hopes of helping others think through it, we’re sharing our approach and results.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"hard-calls-in-uncertain-times\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#hard-calls-in-uncertain-times\"\u003eHard calls in uncertain times\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven recent trends, we had a feeling Figma’s original remote policy wasn’t going to work for a post-COVID world, but our leadership team was divided on how it should evolve. Even discussing these issues was difficult given we hadn’t aligned on the same language. It was hard not to conflate plans for reopening the office with our future workplace strategy. And since reopening the office is a huge can of worms in itself, we decided to separate these decisions and work backwards from our long term policy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn times of uncertainty, values are good tools for decision making, and we leaned heavily on them for this process. During one of our first conversations, we debated if we needed to decide now versus later. Why not pause to see what our peers would do, then follow their lead? Ultimately we decided that we shouldn’t wait to work through this—lack of clarity was a source of employee anxiety and we needed to pick a direction so we could start optimizing our culture. Furthermore, one of our company values is “Be Bold” which refers to our history of working on meaningful projects, even when they are hard. It’s decidedly not bold to just wait and see what everyone else does!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe quickly realized we needed to understand Figmate preferences in order to create a policy that would work for our team. After failing to find a survey template that fit our specific needs, I partnered with Figma’s Head of People to create a new one. The survey was then vetted with our amazing research team who gave great feedback. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo get as complete a picture as possible of our staff’s preferences, we gathered personal stories and hard numbers, via both write-in and multiple choice questions. We asked about everything from commute habits to productivity levels during COVID to remote work preferences.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterested in adapting the survey we created for Figma? You can see \u003ca href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Figmas-Return-to-WorkWorkforce-Planning-Survey--A5dwt28aR4tK2gwU9iXRXFB5Ag-nKGryo4w3h6Z0WraMxgd4\"\u003ethe questions here\u003c/a\u003e. We encourage you to use this as a way to hear people as individuals. Dig into your employees’ understanding of the survey’s language. Push for a majority response rate. Gather different kinds of information. Do the work. It’s hard and time-consuming…but worth it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"survey-results\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#survey-results\"\u003eSurvey results\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe survey was lengthy and only open for one week, but more than 90% of our team filled it out (with no reminders).  It was immediately clear that this is a topic everyone at Figma feels strongly about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the submission deadline closed, I spent the weekend parsing through data. It was a learning experience for me to understand where various employees were coming from in their answers and I was surprised with many of the results. I’d expected at least some level of convergence on certain topics, but almost no one had the same opinion on these issues. It was clear that I’d need to make an informed decision on the workplace policy and then own it as CEO. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, in one multiple choice question we asked people how they defined “flexible schedule,” in terms of which days in a given week should be available for WFH. (This was a follow up to whether they preferred a flexible work schedule, working entirely from the office or entirely from home.) Seemingly everyone had a different take on what flexible meant for them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDigging into location preferences, almost half of employees currently based in San Francisco said they would consider moving to another city within commute distance if we offered multiple WFH days per week. Nearly two thirds of employees said they would consider moving to a non-hub location before the end of 2022 if all roles had the option to be remote. When asked why they were interested in moving or working remotely, Figmates cited cost of living, desire for home ownership, and wanting to be closer to family.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, many employees told us in free text replies how much they loved the office; it was clear people missed the sense of connection and serendipity it enabled. They self-ranked their productivity scores as high, despite everything happening in the world right now. But many said they weren’t making connections to employees outside their core team, and there was a lot of FOMO about not knowing new hires. (The Figma team is \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/careers/\"\u003erapidly scaling\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"validation\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#validation\"\u003eValidation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe data showed our employees valued flexibility but still had an attachment to our office. So we decided to talk with a number of hybrid companies, which led to some really valuable insights:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Where to find someone:\u003c/strong\u003e It’s important for employees to have a predictable mental model for where they can find the people they work with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Timing for office days:\u003c/strong\u003e Implementing a fully flexible WFH schedule can lead to a “ghost town” office. If no one comes in at the same time, then you lose the moments of connection and serendipity that make in-person offices beneficial.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. The hybrid model is hard:\u003c/strong\u003e All the companies we talked with were committed to the hybrid workplace model, but they all were open about its challenges, especially with remote inclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven this feedback and survey results, we landed on the following policy:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"hubs\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#hubs\"\u003eHubs\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEveryone has to choose whether they will associate with a hub or be remote.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe SF hub will have a flexible model, where people will be expected to come in at least two specific days per week. These days will be the same for everyone in the office to maximize connection and serendipity.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs we open new hubs, there will initially be an expectation of more in-office time as we build momentum around the physical space. Over time, the policy for these new hubs will converge with the rest of the company.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"remote\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#remote\"\u003eRemote\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe will initially support all continental US for remote work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSufficient working hours overlap is required for Figma to approve remote work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePay will be localized immediately for new hires and in 2021 for current Figmates.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn many ways, we followed our normal design process in revising this policy. We thought about the competitive landscape and ecosystem, collected data, explored different options and then converged on a solution. However, unlike making a product change, this was weirdly emotional for me—small changes in policy sometimes felt like we were leaping between potential worlds. I didn’t feel like I had a framework for the decision until the end of our process and at times it was as if there was nothing to hold onto.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"communication-and-rollout\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#communication-and-rollout\"\u003eCommunication and rollout\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I prepped an All Hands presentation called “The future is remote” for the Figma team, I tried to keep in mind that employees were at different stages of processing all the changes brought by COVID. I did my best to be transparent about how we made the decision to move to this new model, and I walked Figmates through the trends, survey results and policy decisions we considered. Finally we talked about Figma’s role in building products for distributed and remote teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe still had certain details to nail down, and we knew we’d be inundated with questions. But we wanted to share as early as possible rather than keep employees in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince the presentation, our team has been working on the necessary processes and policies that underlie the hybrid workforce model. As you might imagine, it adds a bunch of complexity throughout our systems. A few examples: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEmployment laws and rules differ from state to state so contracts with remote employees must be handled differently depending on location.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor comp localization, we are still collecting data and finalizing our strategy for different locations.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe are working on setting standard working hours for all US-based employees.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"final-reflections\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#final-reflections\"\u003eFinal reflections\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking ahead, we’re thinking a lot about how Figma’s culture needs to change so we can adapt to this hybrid world. Right now our communication is very synchronous and verbal. Over time, I’m eager to move the team towards more async and artifact-based communication in order to reduce the number of meetings (Zoom fatigue is real!) and make decision making more transparent. These are important changes that will allow us to be more inclusive of remote workers once office hubs open up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile this decision feels “right” to me, it’s hard to know exactly how this will play out over time; we will need to find ways to measure if it’s working and adjust if it’s not. I’m under no illusion that migrating from an in-office culture to a flexible, hybrid model will be simple and we have a lot to learn. But I’m glad we made this decision now, instead of waiting to see how COVID unfolds. It gives our employees the information they need for important life choices and it allows us to make long-term optimizations to the way we work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy hope is that this recap is helpful to others who are working through similar issues. I’m sure some readers will disagree with our methods or conclusions—if this is you, I invite you to join the conversation and share your organization’s plans for the future. As challenging as this period of change has been, I’m truly excited to see what new models and experiments come out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

In such an unprecedented time, I didn’t know what to expect.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"building-relationships\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#building-relationships\"\u003eBuilding relationships\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithout being able to tap someone on the shoulder, have a spontaneous conversation in the hallway, or grab coffee near the office, I imagined it might be more difficult to interact with those beyond my immediate team. To my surprise, this wasn’t the case. While we weren’t in the office, the team was intentional about creating opportunities to meet others across Figma. Each week brought company-wide events like show-and-tell—a biweekly meeting where Figmates share recent learnings or in-progress work. During our Thursday tech talks, I learned about Figmates’ passions, hobbies, and creative projects (like how \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHXmj3hN5mI\"\u003eFigma in Quarantine: the Musical\u003c/a\u003e came to life). Through one-on-ones, I gained a deeper insight into Figma’s product and growth, while team activities—like cooking classes, online escape rooms, and scavenger hunts—allowed me to connect with coworkers on a more personal level. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"product-fluency\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#product-fluency\"\u003eProduct fluency\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore I could dive into a project, I needed to deeply understand Figma’s features and functionality and familiarize myself with design terminology. If I had questions about anything from a new product update to a design concept, I reached out to my mentor, teammates, and Slack channels for support. When I ran into an obstacle, I was surprised by how willing Figmates were to hop on a call and work through the issue together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"my-first-project-style-picker-improvements\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#my-first-project-style-picker-improvements\"\u003eMy first project: style picker improvements\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI soon learned about my first project: improvements to the style picker, a feature that allows users to browse and apply paint, text, effect, or layout grid styles to objects in the Figma editor. Through meetings with designers and product managers, it soon became clear that these improvements were in high demand from the Figma community. The frustration was understandable—the original style picker became unmanageable as the number of styles increased, obscuring important information and forcing users to manually scroll through long lists. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt first, I was hesitant. Coming in as an intern, I didn’t expect to have responsibility over a popular, user-facing feature. But as I got started, I realized this would be a great learning experience for me, and a way to build something impactful for our users. Over the next few weeks, I worked with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/shanawho?lang=en\"\u003eShana Hu\u003c/a\u003e, the team’s product designer, to implement these improvements:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSearch:\u003c/strong\u003e Users often already have a particular style in mind when using the style picker.

Through working with Typescript and C++ in the editor and Ruby in the backend, I gained hands-on experience with the full suite of web technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the project neared completion, I presented the feature internally during show-and-tell. Figmates filled the Zoom chat with enthusiastic and supportive comments, immediately calming my nerves. Still, the implementation process came with challenges. Before launch, we needed to migrate millions of existing text styles in order to populate their metadata with text style metrics; running the migration alone took an entire day! Other challenges included incorporating feedback from critiques and making last-minute bug fixes. These obstacles were tough in the moment, but they ultimately helped me gain a broader and deeper understanding of the codebase.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce the updates were ready to go, I worked with our data science team to make sure we were tracking the right metrics and with marketing to finalize the details of launch day. Everything was coming together, and we were in the final stretch! Launch day soon arrived, and we flipped the feature on, excitedly refreshing the Figma editor as the reactions on social media came in. Reading through the comments, it felt surreal to see the feature that had been guarded for so long finally in the open. As my mentor Josh put it: “It’s the high that keeps you going.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"my-learnings\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#my-learnings\"\u003eMy learnings\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBased on what I had heard from peers interning elsewhere, I went into this internship thinking that I’d work on a specific part of a feature. Instead, I got to experience what it takes to ship a product, end to end: conception, critiques, implementation, metrics, promotion, and launch. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it feels like the internship flew by, when I think back to my first week at Figma, I realize how much I’ve grown as an engineer. True, I’ve learned the rules of React Hooks and the dangers of props spreading, but I’ve also experienced the more nuanced parts of engineering at Figma. Cross-functional interactions improved my ability to communicate technical information, while design critiques, bug bashes, and collaborating with designers sharpened my intuition for product and UX design. Most importantly, assuming engineering responsibility for a feature boosted my confidence, and I feel ready to take on a new challenge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn an era of remote work and uncertainty, I didn’t know what to expect at the start of the internship. At best, I hoped to gain a sense of Figma’s product and culture, but instead I found myself enveloped in truly meaningful projects and workflows. I’d like to thank my mentor \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/unfollowjoshshi?lang=en\"\u003eJosh Shi\u003c/a\u003e for his guidance and feedback. \u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"dUmS1OuEhBXs\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs our team grows, we\u0026#39;re excited to see more students, educators, and classrooms using Figma.

It’s also possible to approach this in a non-algorithmic way—by taking advantage of strokes to emulate shadows with spread distances—but I quickly realized that wasn’t an option either; we handle certain vertex angles differently in strokes than you’d want for shadow spread, and we don’t have stroke generation code in our prototype renderer. Somehow we needed to find a way to make this work without adding tons of complex geometry code to two different rendering codebases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-framework-for-prioritization\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-framework-for-prioritization\"\u003eA framework for prioritization\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf there’s one thing I love more than debugging rendering bugs, it’s reading specs about internet technologies. (Ask me \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@lbudorick/weird-things-i-love-about-gifs-e2fed7ccce03\"\u003eall the weird things I learned about GIF89a\u003c/a\u003e when implementing GIF support in Figma last year.) I began to interrogate the assumptions we’d held about shadow spreads. We know Figma users today implement workarounds and include separately maintained documentation for developer handoff when shadow spread values are involved. If we’re building shadow spread because we want to reduce friction during developer handoff, CSS should guide our constraints. Do we really need to draw perfect shadow spreads for hole-y Figma logos? Can we even do that in CSS?!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, we can\u0026#39;t. The thing about \u003ccode\u003ebox-shadow\u003c/code\u003e is that it only works to render shadows of \u003cem\u003eboxes\u003c/em\u003e (and other box-like things, which include ellipses, if you get the corner radii right). \u003ccode\u003ebox-shadow\u003c/code\u003e will not render a shadow of the Figma logo as a copy-of-the-logo-but-blobby; rather, it will render a box.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e(An aside: at every step in this process, someone told me, “actually, spread values are supported in \u003ccode\u003efilter: drop-shadow()\u003c/code\u003e,” and pointed me to an MDN page that mistakenly implied that spread values were included in the spec and were simply not supported by browsers yet. Unfortunately, this was never true, as explicitly noted in the \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects-1/#funcdef-filter-drop-shadow\"\u003eW3C spec\u003c/a\u003e. We know!

We decided to ruthlessly prioritize: we’d at least do what CSS can do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo make this happen, we decided to implement CSS-like shadow spread parameters only on shapes where \u003ccode\u003ebox-shadow\u003c/code\u003e would apply: rectangles, ellipses, frame backgrounds, and component backgrounds. This seemed achievable by doing the simple thing, more or less—generating a bigger or smaller version of the original node. It’s not quite as straightforward as stretching the node, as this would break down on things like rounded corners. Still, it’s easy enough to generate new rectangle geometries in both of our rendering engines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?rect=0,0,1600,900\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=377\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eTop: a shadow generated simply by stretching the object’s geometry; bottom: a shadow created by generating a new rounded rectangle\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"hiccups-along-the-way\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#hiccups-along-the-way\"\u003eHiccups along the way\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, nothing was as straightforward as we expected. There were several hitches in this plan: how would we generate correct ellipses? (A true spread shadow for an ellipse would no longer be definitionally elliptical; our ellipse generation code does not generate non-ellipses, and simple transforms on an ellipse in either direction maintain its elliptical properties.) How would we render rounded corners when a spread distance was applied to a rounded rectangle? (The W3 spec defines both a general rule about transforming corner radii, and a specific formula to use for large spread values.) How would we render shadow spread on stroke-only nodes, an undefined behavior in CSS?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe solved a few of these problems with the tried-and-true science of mashing buttons in a CodePen and seeing what browsers do.

From there, our search indexers retrieve messages, get the most up to date information from our database and then index that into our elasticsearch cluster. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=383\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA look at our regular search indexing pipeline\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan\u003e{\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e123\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;folder_id\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e28\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;team_id\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e456\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;File\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;folder_name\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;Drafts\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e,\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e}\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eDeep search is a different beast. While our regular search indexers gather a file’s metadata such as its key or team id from the database, the representation of our Fig files (our internal name for Figma files) is stored as a .fig document type in Amazon S3. The Fig file can be thought of as a tree, where a node represents a Figma object like an ellipsis, frame, vector, or some text. Each node also contains an object’s properties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"making-tradeoffs\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#making-tradeoffs\"\u003eMaking tradeoffs\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it’s fairly cheap to retrieve things from our database, retrieving a Fig file and then walking through it is extremely computationally expensive because they may have thousands of nodes. It would be expensive to make changes to our deep search index at the same cadence as our regular search index—as you edit your file, a new save is made for you every 30 seconds. Instead, we deduplicate all file changes every hour and send those files off to be processed by our file-analyzer workers—the platform we built for DSA which helps handle computationally intensive, periodic tasks. We made the product decision to allow deep search results to be stale for a short amount of time to save our servers a significant amount of duplicated work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=383\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA look at deep search indexing\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s say we have a file that contains five relevant nodes: a frame, rectangle and three text nodes.

Should instances count, or only components? Do we care about page names and layers or just text? Here, search is more art than science. It’s not immediately clear what would improve search accuracy and what would just be plain noise. To tease out the intricacies, we implemented different versions of deep search to try for ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom our hands-on approach, we learned a lot about how users interact with Figma. For example, it turns out that page names—for the most part—are more generic than the contents of your page; page names are relatively short and tend to be categorical rather than unique to the file. A common pattern we found was page names being used to show the progression of the designs: “Idea”, “Rough draft”, “Final.” Searching through page names gives the average user less signal than the content in their page, as they’d apply the same naming scheme for the pages across all their Fig files. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also made the call that instances of components matter. There was much debate around this particular discussion—since instances are copies of a main component, leaving them out meant that we could de-duplicate a ton of text, greatly reducing the size of our deep search index. Storage nowadays is relatively cheap, but it’s not free. We ultimately decided that not only do components matter, but also the frequency of components in your Fig file matter too. If you add an instance with the text “Figma is cool” into a file 100 times, this should rank higher in your search results for “Figma is cool” than a file that only has this string once. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the day, search is a living, breathing, developing product. We’re learning as we go about what users are looking for and how, and applying this information to make a better product going forward. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"the-team-behind-deep-search\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-team-behind-deep-search\"\u003eThe team behind deep search\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile deep search required coordination across teams, the working group was relatively small, allowing us to move quickly. I (Shloak, here!) recently joined Figma full-time, but I worked on deep search while I was an intern on our infrastructure team. I started with an infrastructure-side investigation before partnering closely with Stella, an engineer on our collaboration team, to productize the work. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStella oversaw the roll out of our dark and live launches, and brought in our infrastructure and data science partners to ensure the project would be a success. Lizhi, another engineer on infrastructure, was instrumental in making sure file search remained performant. It was incredible to work with such a great team on unique technical problems as an intern, and one of the reasons I chose to return to Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"jYuMhW7e5lg0\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we continue thinking about the ways designers collaborate with people across teams, we’ll look to specific workflows, like developer handoff.

To keep up, BT has had to look internally, re-evaluating how teams work together to deliver better products for customers.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-evolution-to-a-product-squad-model\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-evolution-to-a-product-squad-model\"\u003eThe evolution to a product squad model\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first step to BT’s transformation was redesigning how teams build and ship products. The product, engineering, and design teams were re-organized into a product squad model, where smaller, more flexible teams were formed to own end-to-end delivery of their product. For the first time, a designer’s team wasn’t just made up of fellow designers; teammates included product owners, engineers, content designers, and others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?rect=2,0,3996,3000\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eBT’s designers developing a new digital brand identity\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the product squad model encouraged a more collaborative approach, it shined a light on workflow issues—too many different tools, inefficient processes, and communication hurdles. “We were juggling docs, Sketch, InVision, Jira, and many other tools,” said Head of Design Operations Matt Gottschalk. “We spent more time moving content and design files between tools and managing multiple feedback streams than on the design work itself. When processes aren’t streamlined, it’s hard to collaborate and design cohesively across teams and multiple product lines.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo help alleviate some of these challenges, the design operations team started a re-evaluation of their design organization’s tools. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"migrating-to-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#migrating-to-figma\"\u003eMigrating to Figma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith over 180 designers, the design operations team had to thoughtfully pilot Figma and other tools to get buy-in. They started by testing Figma with one product squad over a two-month period. Within a few weeks, that product squad started to report back positive feedback. “The squad found it easier to collaborate in real-time,” Gottschalk said. “Design hand-offs became easier, and we stopped having to move design files from tool to tool. We just designed, prototyped, and presented design work all from one place.”\u003cbr/\u003eBut it wasn’t just designers who benefited. Product owners, and engineers had more visibility into design work, allowing them to provide input earlier in the process. “Figma removed silos within our product squads and enabled the rest of the product squad to be part of the design process,” Gottschalk said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/103fd7ac9b0bc3878c8425a2a0e5d7822e12a3ac-900x506.jpg?rect=0,0,899,506\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=377\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/103fd7ac9b0bc3878c8425a2a0e5d7822e12a3ac-900x506.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/103fd7ac9b0bc3878c8425a2a0e5d7822e12a3ac-900x506.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/103fd7ac9b0bc3878c8425a2a0e5d7822e12a3ac-900x506.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/103fd7ac9b0bc3878c8425a2a0e5d7822e12a3ac-900x506.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 899w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eContent writers edit in-line with design\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter the pilot, BT rolled out Figma across all product squads.

If they were anything like the feelings of dread, uncertainty, and anxiety that most people experience when they search for health advice on the internet, you’re not alone. Finding the best next steps for care when you’re sick has historically been an overwhelming task. That’s why we at Clearstep set out to overhaul the experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2018, we shipped a symptom checking and care routing platform, enabling patients to determine whether or not to seek care and what type of healthcare provider to see for their symptoms. Along the way, the team added functionality for intelligently pairing users with convenient care resources (accounting for a user’s location and insurance network), generating cost estimates based on the user’s insurance plan, and scheduling care right from the Clearstep symptom checking platform. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWorking with a small team on features that affect thousands of patients and their healthcare choices is no small undertaking, which is why speed and accuracy of our design process is instrumental to our success.

While some differences in the presentation of headers and body text seemed subtle, they ultimately affected how users navigated symptom checking and evaluated care options. Button text automatically resizes, so we could easily test different copy options, ultimately saving time for other design tasks that require a higher cognitive load.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClearstep licenses its symptom checking and care routing platform to health systems, enabling their patients to navigate care resources. In doing so, we often produce briefs to showcase a white-labeled version of our technology with customer branding.

I’m currently at Coda, where we’re building a new kind of doc that combines word processing, spreadsheets, and app-like capabilities so you can do things that range from taking notes to creating your own processes and workflows.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs product designers, we often hesitate to share our work early on, especially with our developers. In my experience, knowing how and when to collaborate with others plays a large factor in a project’s success. Here’s a look at how I’ve worked to bring engineers into the design process as early as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"technical-knowledge-can-guide-ideation\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#technical-knowledge-can-guide-ideation\"\u003eTechnical knowledge can guide ideation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the past, I’ve said things like, “I need time and space to create. I’m a creative.” Or, “If I share this mock, they’ll build it right away,” and I don’t want us to immediately get focused on a solution. But over the years, I’ve learned how to better work with engineers to understand the constraints a lot faster and, as a result, build more thoughtful solutions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis ideation part of the design process—when you’re trying to understand constraints and come up with ideas—is when it’s especially important to work closely with engineers. Engineers are really great at ideation because they have so much technical knowledge that they can help guide you in those constraints and flag when something unexpected might come up. When you have all of those edge cases right away, then you can build more thoughtful solutions. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"how-to-involve-engineers-early\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how-to-involve-engineers-early\"\u003eHow to involve engineers early\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow do you actually go about doing that?

In my case, that engineering partner was Gil. The feature we were building, Packs Tables, allows you to pull in data from apps like Spotify, Google Calendar, and Gmail directly into a Coda doc. You connect to the app with your account and pull in data such as my playlist from Spotify, my calendar events, and so on. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s mine from Spotify:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=377\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1280w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eA feature like this is very technical. Since we were working with APIs from different apps, we had to come up with something that would work across all of them. There are three things we did to arrive at that solution: created straw man mocks, brainstormed new ideas, and defined key questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s a look at each one:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_1-start-with-straw-man-mocks\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_1-start-with-straw-man-mocks\"\u003e1.

Straw man mocks are the visual equivalent of that—they can be simple and fairly uninformed. They’re more about asking key questions and addressing your assumptions and less about nailing down every single detail. The idea is that they should:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe quick to make. You don’t want to spend a ton of time on them because your ideas at this point frequently include misconceptions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAsk more questions than offer solutions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShow variety versus narrowing in on a single thing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eStart by asking yourself how the project would look if it were easy and how it would work. As you’re walking through these mocks with your engineer, proactively drill deeper with questions like:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat are your biggest misconceptions?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat are you missing that you haven’t thought about yet?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat is an interesting direction we might take?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat are difficult directions we might take? It’s not to avoid those directions, but it is helpful to hear what engineers find difficult so you can understand those trade offs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_2-brainstorm-new-ideas\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_2-brainstorm-new-ideas\"\u003e2. Brainstorm new ideas\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this point, it’s still early in the process. While you have straw man mocks and your own assumptions, it’s still important to brainstorm with others and visualize new ideas. As designers, we have the skill of being able to bring ideas and questions to life—we do that sometimes for our own ideas, but it’s also helpful to do that early on with your teammates. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo visualize ideas with our engineering partners, we use a wireframing kit. At Coda, we have all our components ready to go, so we actually design in high-fi quite a bit (unless we’re designing something completely new). In today’s world, with so many of us working remotely, you can also just point your camera to a pen and paper or screenshare on an iPad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the Packs Tables process, Gil and I used whiteboarding to get specific about the questions we had and draw out some UI. Again, because it’s still early at this stage, we weren’t trying to design the UI. Still, we wanted to make sure that we were on the same page about ideas and potential problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=377\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1280w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eGil, my engineering partner, helping me whiteboard new ideas\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_3-define-your-key-questions\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_3-define-your-key-questions\"\u003e3.

When I describe my job to someone not in tech, people think I design “logos and stuff.” To demonstrate how design is more than that, I typically launch into a full explanation of the design process—how we generate ideas, validate them, talk to users, etc. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy the end of it, they come to the conclusion that I design \u0026#34;mocks.” It’s technically accurate. My main output is indeed “mocks.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut as we all know, design is a lot more than designing mocks. It can be designing delight, joy, culture, process, and community. And designing these types of experiences relies on co-designing not just with designers but with teammates across your entire company. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo illustrate what this looks like, here are a few real examples of how we co-design (outside of just mocks!) with teammates at Segment:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"mapping-our-customers-journey-with-ux-research\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#mapping-our-customers-journey-with-ux-research\"\u003eMapping our customers’ journey with UX research\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo better understand the product experience for our users, one of our designers worked with one of our UX researchers to co-design this customer journey map in Figma. Starting from discovery and sign-up to ending with scaled implementation of the product, they took the entire Segment journey and mapped out the experience for different tiers of customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe designers and researcher supplemented each step of the journey with analytics and created an interactive prototype with clickable customer stories. This file has become the source of truth for whenever we as an entire Segment team need to reference our customers’ experience, and as an additional bonus, a great onboarding tool!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"diagramming-our-data-architecture\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#diagramming-our-data-architecture\"\u003eDiagramming our data architecture\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSegment is a customer data platform, which means we have a ton of data flowing through our product. A bunch of our teammates got together—designers, researchers, customer success managers, and infrastructure engineers—to diagram all the data that’s flowing through our platform and highlighted how the data is being transformed, enriched, and cleaned. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis diagram has become a foundational component for how we build future products. It highlights where we are strong and where we should focus on improving, acting as another source of truth for our team at Segment as we think about these problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"retrospective-on-our-design-system\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#retrospective-on-our-design-system\"\u003eRetrospective on our design system\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Segment, we have an open source design system called Evergreen. Because many teams beyond design use our design system, it’s critical for us to gather feedback from other teammates—especially from our partners in engineering—about how Evergreen is serving us as an org. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA couple of weeks ago, one of our design leads led a retrospective to gather feedback about Evergreen. This is something we would have normally done in person, but now that we’re all remote, we jumped into a Figma file instead. Using virtual sticky notes, a team of designers and engineers wrote out pain points and mapped out areas of opportunities that exist with our design system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot only was this exercise useful, it helped us create a framework for next quarter’s OKRs and fostered a new way of thinking about our design system. Through this process, we were able to co-design a roadmap for a path forward!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCo-designing can also help create a sense of community with others. In preparation for International Women’s Day this past March, our awesome Chief Product Development Officer planned on sending all our female-identifying teammates in EPD (Engineering, Product, and Design) a card of appreciation. In a world where we were remote, we couldn’t exactly do that the way we originally planned. So our teammates jumped into Figma to co-design and collaborate on meaningful notes  to a fellow female coworker and express how they’d like to learn from them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe do these types of virtual cards too for birthdays, now that we can’t celebrate these special occasions in person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile some of the above examples may challenge your definition of co-designing, I hope it provides some ideas and inspiration around how might we co-design together beyond mocks. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that in mind, what will you co-design? Who will you co-design for? What impact could it have?

Unlike hackathons—which are largely built for engineering and design—Maker Week is for everyone, across teams and skillsets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s also a key part of our culture. Some projects are a bit more playful (see: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1263135345790423041\"\u003emaking a musical\u003c/a\u003e), but Maker Week is really about removing the limitations of day-to-day work and giving us a chance to collaborate in new ways. We delete non-essential meetings, pause our interview processes (if possible), and relish the time to connect with Figmates we otherwise may not work with in our day-to-day roles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile we knew things would be a bit different this year, we wanted to carry on the Maker Week tradition.

Below, we’re sharing a peek into the creative direction of our most recent Maker Week: the theme, our graphic system, and how we brought moments of delight online. A visual approach is usually reserved for external launches and events, but we knew that a thoughtful creative direction would inform the energy of the week, and ultimately what the team ended up building.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"setting-the-tone\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#setting-the-tone\"\u003eSetting the tone\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was important for us all at Figma to acknowledge that Maker Week would take a different shape.

Being remote actually allowed us to explore this direction more fully. It’s easy to feel distant when stuck behind a computer screen, so we really encouraged everyone to be vulnerable with each other. The upside of being remote is that there’s something freeing about it.

Either it becomes a bad influence (you end up with a copy-paste) or your creativity is herded into a narrow mindset.” That doesn’t mean that you can’t look to others to see how they problem solve. “Instead, I seek out stuff people have done in neighboring fields or similar-but-different problems,” he says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesign is, arguably, in everything that we make and do.

But the difference is they’re thinking out loud.

They’re simply following the driver and asking probing questions that would typically come up in design critiques. “I think we have a pattern like this elsewhere in our product? Our users tend to get confused here. How can we help bring more guidance?” The navigator should never be criticizing the work, but rather simply bring up questions that would have come up a week later in critique or a month later when the feature is released to users.

I’ve since received a few messages asking for more content like this, so I figured it’s worth expanding more on how our team works. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHistorically we’ve written about \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-design-team/\"\u003ehiring\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/design-critiques-at-figma/\"\u003ecritiques\u003c/a\u003e, but haven’t yet stepped back to talk more about our overall design team process. So, consider this a deeper dive into our day-to-day: meeting cadences, rituals, and anything else that helps our design team stay connected and efficient. But first, two caveats:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is about “design team” process, not “product team” process.\u003c/strong\u003e If you’re at a company with more than one designer, inevitably you’ve realized that you’re actually part of at least two cultures at the same time. You’re both a member of the “design team” (horizontal) and the the “product team” (vertical), each with their own version of stand ups, off-sites, and activities to \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/keeping-that-tightknit-feeling-at-a-distance/\"\u003ebring the team closer together\u003c/a\u003e and achieve their goals. The horizontal team helps you to maintain consistency across the product and a high quality bar, elevating the craft of design in the company; the vertical team is ultimately what ships and delivers product improvements and builds expertise within focused areas. It’s important to invest in both.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe balance of these identities often changes with the size and stage of the company.  When a company is small, the design team bands closely together to distribute workloads. As it expands, designers often filter into working groups focused on specific product areas. As a mid-stage company with 10 product designers, we’re starting to notice natural tensions between these identities. Our designers are mostly embedded in product areas, but sometimes more than one, and sometimes none at all. Some designers (pre-Covid) sit with other designers, and some sit with their engineers. At our size, we’re encouraging the team to focus more energy on relationships with their product teams, and rely on our design team process to handle the rest. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis article addresses these design team processes, but does not discuss overall product team process. You can read more about our product-specific processes \u003ca href=\"https://coda.io/@yuhki/figma-product-roadmap\"\u003ein this article about roadmapping from Yuhki\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/skuwamoto/status/1235042668494741504\"\u003ethis tweet storm from Sho\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/805270101178055648\"\u003ethis diagram depicting PMs and designer relationships\u003c/a\u003e at Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYes, we’re in a pandemic, and it’s pretty weird.\u003c/strong\u003e It’s impossible to ignore the effect that Covid-19 has had on teams worldwide. During trying times like these, it’s important to give each other space when personal life takes a toll. For example, during our last team meeting, I shared that I’m expecting a significant disruption in output (if we’re normally operating at 100%, maybe this is like 60%), and encouraged everyone to take days off for mental health. It’s an isolating and lonely time. But this is also exactly why I’ve found collaborating with our peers a privilege worth embracing; a healthy team process can help maintain a sense of community in the absence of more organic social connections.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, only you can determine if your team is ready for a shake-up to your process when there are so many other things to adjust to. So please don’t read this article and jump to “we should do this!” We’re just trying to be transparent about how we work for anyone who’s curious. And while I’m writing this during a unique point in time—we can’t leave our homes to work from the office, or even share a coffee—it turns out that only a few small things in this article apply strictly to this particular moment or to a remote landscape in general. Most of the processes here should be relevant to remote and non-remote teams alike, pandemic or not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=194\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eDuring Covid-19 vs. after Covid-19\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith that out of the way, here’s what you can expect: I’ve broken up the post into \u003ca href=\"#weekly-processes\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eweekly processes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"#monthly-and-quarterly-rituals\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emonthly and quarterly rituals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"#tips-for-running-your-own-activities\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8 tips for running your own activities\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.

The 30 minute meeting consists of four parts: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeekend update (5-10 minutes)\u003c/strong\u003e: We each go around the room and share a quick highlight or two of what we did over the weekend (if we’re using Zoom, one person starts then nominates the next person). Even if these days it\u0026#39;s some variant of “I stayed home,” “made bread,” “played Animal Crossing,” “entertained my kid”, or “binged Westworld,” it’s still an important tradition. More than anything, it reminds us that we’re all in this together. It also starts the week on a positive note and allows us to ease into the work week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHighlights (5 minutes)\u003c/strong\u003e: We then take a couple minutes heads down to reflect on the week prior, looking back at our calendars to remind us how we spent our time. We compile highlights in a Notion doc to celebrate the little victories. Big projects take time to ship, so it’s helpful to find ways of acknowledging notable progress, whether you made breakthrough in the design, or received some great feedback during user studies. We once toyed with the idea of having a sort of “MVP” of the week for folks who had particularly strong weeks, but that hasn’t stuck and there isn’t always an obvious candidate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCritique/meeting schedule (5-10 minutes)\u003c/strong\u003e: We plan our critiques and team meetings ahead of time so everyone knows what to expect, and so we don’t waste time during those meetings figuring out the agenda. We go around the room again (this time taking the reverse order from who did the weekend updates) and each person decides if they have a topic they’d like critiqued during the week, and on which day. There are typically two critique slots: Wednesday at 9:30am and Friday at 2:00pm (more on that later), but if there’s an overflow of topics, we add a slot on Monday at 4:00pm or suggest they receive the critique asynchronously via Slack. If someone doesn’t have a topic, we still ask that they share their focus for the week so everyone has ambient awareness of what’s going on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnnouncements (5-10 minutes)\u003c/strong\u003e: Finally, I share company-wide announcements and updates specific to the design team.

Whether that’s revisiting our design principles, discussing how critiques are going, brainstorming how to up-level quality, or reviewing the previous quarter, we usually find ourselves answering more strategic questions. We also have more timely sessions—in a recent meeting, we talked about what we can do to better support other teams during this pandemic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe topics are scheduled during the warm up, and if there’s no agenda, we cancel the meeting. We end up canceling at least 1 per month, or replacing the time slot with a critique (if there was an overflow of topics).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt should not be the sole responsibility of the design team lead to move all of this forward. Your team undoubtably has thoughtful, talented people who are well-positioned to help solve these problems. I believe the most productive and healthiest teams feel a shared responsibility to improve the team’s activities. Most of the best ideas we’ve had from the team did NOT come from me. It was \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/nikolasklein\"\u003eNiko\u003c/a\u003e who originally suggested we revisit our hiring practices, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jenny_wen\"\u003eJenny\u003c/a\u003e who came up with better debrief templates with less bias, and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mwichary\"\u003eMarcin\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/shanawho\"\u003eShana\u003c/a\u003e who’ve started thinking more about our new hire onboarding practices.

Above all, think about how to guide the discussion in a way that feels safe. Consider time-boxing complex topics and hearing feedback “around the room” one at a time, so that those who feel less comfortable in group settings have a designated time to speak up.

During the meeting, everyone has 1-2 minutes to share their slide, which—if all 22 people attend—consumes the largest portion of the one-hour meeting. With the remaining time, we either do some sort of social activity or a deeper dive into a project (like when Tori walked through the latest updates to the brand guidelines).

One tradition we started (and have since continued) is to share an embarrassing piece of work from when we first got started in design.

Doing so ensures that everyone has a chance to participate effectively. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne outcome from these is usually a perspective on what the product design team thinks are the most important areas for Figma to be working on.

One way to start is to ask your team how they describe the company or the team to others. Once you’ve identified what makes your team unique, you can come up with ways to bring that to life in your processes.

Or, simply ask one another.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLeverage the team\u003c/strong\u003e: Some teams may have a dedicated design producer or ops person to help. Since we don’t, I rely on our team to define and implement processes along with me. This often creates better outcomes anyway since folks feel personally invested. If someone on your team has been looking for more leadership opportunities, give them more explicit ownership of something like critiques for a bit. Or consider rotating ownership of the meeting each quarter to keep things fresh. Try not to hold on too tightly to your own ideas; most of these meetings serve the team, so it’s important they’re bought into them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuild a routine\u003c/strong\u003e: If you find that you need to schedule a number of ad hoc meetings, perhaps there’s a way to streamline and centralize discussion in weekly patterns instead. It’s tiring for people to not be able to predict where to go for certain types of conversations; giving them a consistent and regular cadence each week builds routine and avoids spending excess mental energy coordinating. You could also consider branding them a little (as we have with “warm ups” and “cooldowns”) to make the purpose clearer and more memorable.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBe conscious of timing\u003c/strong\u003e: Think about where people are in a given day or week. Crits are difficult too far at the end of the day Friday because people are tired and ready for the weekend. They also are tough to do on Monday early in the day because content isn’t as fresh; they may need time to settle into the work after the weekend. There also may be forced constraints, like if you’re managing a team across time-zones, or balancing times against your team’s other commitments. In certain cases, especially when first getting the timing set, we’ve had to ask people to  move conflicting commitments to make space for these meetings.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTreat change as an experiment\u003c/strong\u003e: New processes and change can be scary at first. To make the team more comfortable, frame new processes as “experiments,” and intentionally check in on them together to see if the proposed changes are working or not. One example of this is (pre-COVID) we had some debates about whether or not we should sit together as a team, or sit closer to our developers. It was a complex topic with a lot of dependencies, but by allowing the team to experiment with one or the other, it gave us permission and confidence to take risks.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eManage a “queue”\u003c/strong\u003e: We keep a queue in Notion that we use for a number of things, like maintaining team meeting and cooldown ideas for future meetings, keeping track of critique guests, and rotating note takers. People can open up the queue at any point throughout a given week, and we manage it with our Monday morning warm-ups when scheduling the weekly meetings. Keeping it one place makes it less likely that we’ll forget about an action item.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInvite the rest of your company in (when appropriate)\u003c/strong\u003e: For us this is more pronounced since we work on a design tool centered around collaboration—teaching more people about design directly relates to our business. Still, inviting others to your critiques as guests can build empathy around the complexity that comes with designing products. It can also help avoid siloing your design team too much from the rest of the company and bring balance to the trade-off between design team culture vs product team culture mentioning in the beginning of this article.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"vOBr07k8FpYH\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy no means is our team process perfect. We still struggle with keeping critiques effective, having regular and productive Monday team meeting topics, and even attendance for social activities like coffees. I also think there’s a natural fatigue that comes with rituals like this, and we’ll need to learn to mix things up every once in a while to keep people engaged. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNonetheless, I wanted to share how we work more openly in case it helps other teams, whether your team is looking to iterate on a stale process, or you’re just starting to introduce some structure.

As the lines between home and work have blurred over the past few months, we’ve seen more Figma engagement than ever before. In addition to interface design, customers are using Figma for tasks like visual whiteboarding, diagramming and slide creation. We’ve also witnessed the birth of new use cases like \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rachelbeen/status/1240106956225835008\"\u003evirtual design sprinting\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1248008574615216128\"\u003ecity building\u003c/a\u003e, and even \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/joeycordes/status/1253383875432189958\"\u003eMinecraft\u003c/a\u003e skin creation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, I’m excited to share that Figma has raised a $50M Series D round of funding, led by Peter Levine and Marc Andreessen at a16z.

Two and a half years later, over 300,000 files every month are exported from Figma to Zeplin. During this current WFH period, we’re seeing an increase of 30-40 percent on top of that. Being individually distributed has accelerated the need for new places to work together and connect online. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor version 2 of our integration, we wanted to improve the export experience and solve some of the performance issues. We knew building a native plugin would not only give our users a more seamless workflow, but also make it easier for our team to build, maintain, and add new features to the integration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve rebuilt the integration from the ground up and today, we’re excited to introduce the brand new Zeplin plugin. From Figma, you can now export frames and components, as well as color and text styles from Figma to Zeplin in a couple clicks. And in Zeplin, developers and other members of your product team can automatically generate accurate specs, assets, and code snippets. Plus, they can see exported assets directly in Zeplin’s style guides. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor users who were already using the previous version of the integration, you’ll find that exporting large Figma files and frames no longer means hiccups with performance or resolutions. For more product details, \u003ca href=\"https://zpl.io/blog/figma\"\u003ehead over to Zeplin’s blog post\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat’s most unique to the Zeplin integration with Figma versus other design tools is that Figma is on the web, which presents unique advantages. One additional feature we’re exploring to build is to automatically push any changes made to Figma components to Zeplin. More details to come on that soon. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the meantime, check out the new integration by \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/745330164019088593/Zeplin\"\u003einstalling the new Zeplin here\u003c/a\u003e or email us with any questions or feedback at \u003ca href=\"mailto:support@zeplin.io\"\u003esupport@zeplin.io\u003c/a\u003e.

We know how disruptive it is when Figma is unavailable, especially in these times. We take downtime very seriously. While there is still more work to be done to ensure we’ve learned everything we can from this incident, we want to share details about what happened and what we did to resolve it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-happened\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-happened\"\u003eWhat happened?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLong story short, we exceeded the CPU capacity that our Proxy servers require to successfully establish secure connections. Our Proxy servers are primarily responsible for two things:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eRouting requests to the appropriate backend services that power Figma.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNegotiating secure TLS connections between you and Figma.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma clients maintain a secure connection to our Proxy servers at all times. This connection ensures you have a realtime view of what’s happening in your files and across your organization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust before this incident, we restarted our Proxy servers to patch an issue that had been released the day before. At that time, our traffic was significantly higher than when we normally restart these servers in the afternoon.  As each proxy server was being restarted, clients attempted to reconnect in mass. The work required to negotiate a secure connection overloaded the CPU on some of our Proxy servers. This slowed down the time to establish a connection just long enough for clients to timeout the connection before it completed. The retries perpetuated the incident until enough clients backed off sufficiently for connections to be established successfully.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile we’ve been focused on scaling and hardening our backend services against sudden disconnects and reconnects, we missed that our Proxy servers were using significantly more CPU to establish secure connections in the brief moments following a restart than they do at other times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"how-did-we-resolve-it\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how-did-we-resolve-it\"\u003eHow did we resolve it?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe were alerted to the incident within seconds of the first request failures by our monitoring systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur first instinct was to look for errors in our dashboards that indicated which type of requests were the problem. To our surprise, there weren’t any obvious errors but the total number of requests was lower than normal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis lead us to look closer at the Proxies themselves where we saw that many connections were stuck in a “waiting” state. Upon closer inspection of the logs, we found a stream of INFO messages indicating that clients were terminating the connections while attempting to establish a secure connection.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe combined number of “active” and “waiting” connections was proportionate to the number of “active” connections before the incident. So the proxies were not overloaded due to an increase in simultaneous connections, but there was a substantial increase in the rate of connections being closed and opened due to the clients that were timing out and reconnecting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we confirmed that the proxies were overloaded, we launched additional capacity. By the time the additional servers came online, enough clients had already reconnected successfully that the service was able to recover on its own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"why-wasn-t-everyone-affected\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#why-wasn-t-everyone-affected\"\u003eWhy wasn’t everyone affected?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of our users in Europe and China connect to a separate fleet of Proxy servers outside the United States so we can route traffic more efficiently back to our servers. If you were in one of the regions where we route traffic through these proxy servers, then you were not affected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"next-steps\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#next-steps\"\u003eNext steps\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe doubled the number of Proxy servers in response to this incident. We’re also updating our capacity planning with new monitoring that will alert us when it’s time to add more Proxies going forward. These immediate changes will help to prevent a recurrence of this particular incident but aren’t enough on their own to mitigate the risk of similar classes of incidents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also need to rethink our reconnection strategy. If our clients had waited longer before attempting to reconnect, the service would have recovered more quickly. Based on the postmortem from this incident, we\u0026#39;re working to create a roadmap of additional infrastructure work we can do to keep Figma stable if similar conditions emerge in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have any questions about this incident, please don’t hesitate to get in touch at \u003ca href=\"mailto:support@figma.com\"\u003esupport@figma.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

You can translate your vision to a prototype, share work, and get input from other collaborators, stakeholders, and teams. Depending on where you are in the development process, they don’t always have to be high-fidelity—in many cases, informal prototypes can be more impactful than something more polished.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere, we share the benefits of lightweight prototypes and some ways the team at Figma is using them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"prototypes-in-practice\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#prototypes-in-practice\"\u003ePrototypes in practice\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can be scary to share something that still feels like a work in progress. But inviting early feedback helps you quickly course correct (if needed) and can save you time down the road.

For example, a quick look at a flow should reveal whether or not the copy in a header, body, and button all match up, and that it’s clear what action the user should take. Since you’ll likely have more than one person writing copy and microcopy, this is a good time to look out for inconsistencies with the voice of the writing. Even if you don’t have a defined style guide, getting a sense of how everything fits together ensures that the tone feels right, even if just directionally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?rect=0,0,1600,1113\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=466\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"add-context\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#add-context\"\u003eAdd context\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile you certainly want a well-thought-out prototype during \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/best-practices/guide-to-developer-handoff/\"\u003ethe developer handoff\u003c/a\u003e, it can also be helpful to share early thinking.

And, we were confident in our decision to teach and practice designing in Figma—it was not only friendly to beginners, but also served professional designers at companies we dreamed of placing our students in. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?rect=2,0,4895,3266\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=447\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eIP students designing in Figma\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving the tool in the browser instead of an application empowered our students to do more designing than they ever had before.

That group includes \u003ca href=\"https://lambdaschool.com/\"\u003eLambda School\u003c/a\u003e, an entirely online, live, instructor-led, 9-month program that teaches professional skills at no upfront cost to students. Lambda School has courses in Web Development, Mobile Development, Data Science, and most recently, added a UX Design program to its roster.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLambda’s mission is to pioneer a new model of higher education. They want to enable and empower students to gain the skills, guidance, and support they need to kickstart a career in tech. As such, creating a remote-accessible learning environment that feels as connected, hands-on, and collaborative as an in-person classroom is core to their mission. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo do that, Lambda has relied on powerful tools like Figma. The team at Figma joined in for a few lessons to see Lambda in action. Here are some of the ways we observed Lambda + Figma elevating the remote teaching and learning experience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"going-deeper-with-interactive-tools\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#going-deeper-with-interactive-tools\"\u003eGoing deeper with interactive tools\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Lambda UX course works like this: all of the students in the class join a video conference and the instructor shares their screen to begin the class. In a typical classroom, this is often when the students quiet down and tune in as the instructor advances her slides. In the Lambda classroom, the presentation is a two-way-street. Lessons presented in Figma invite students to go deeper. Whether it’s zooming in to get a better look at a curve, scrolling around to study a particular logo, or pinpointing what someone is talking about thanks to everyone’s visible pointers, even going through slides is a collective activity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eUsing Figma, students can zoom in and refer to specific parts of a presentation, even as the teacher presents.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to design activities, the benefits of collaboration kick into even higher gear. As Elizabeth Lin, a design instructor at Lambda, says, “with all our design lessons at Lambda School, we make sure that there\u0026#39;s a collaborative element! Students are more motivated and have more fun when we’re all working together.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStudents create their designs right in Figma from the start and iterate from there. The evolution of each design is visible, providing an amazing opportunity for students to observe, learn from, and provide feedback on each other’s work while it’s still in progress. On top of that, students can remix each other’s work to build their own designs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“In a recent class about documentation, I watched students build off of each other\u0026#39;s designs! They used their classmates\u0026#39; work as inspiration and were able to build and explore together,” Elizabeth described. This not only pushes students to make their work better, but also prepares them to join the professional design teams where many designers are working together to execute on a single project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"side-by-side-feedback-and-support\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#side-by-side-feedback-and-support\"\u003eSide-by-side feedback and support\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor new designers, feedback is one of the most helpful pieces of the learning process. Using Figma, students can tap each other and their instructor for thoughts as they’re designing. “One of Lambda’s principles is to create collaborative communities. We want to make sure students are engaged and feel comfortable providing feedback to each other in every lesson,” Elizabeth says. This is something that feels really natural in the traditional classroom that Lambda wanted to bring to their remote classroom.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?rect=0,0,3840,2275\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=397\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eStudents use stars in Figma to vote for another student’s design.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThanks to open audio and Figma’s browser-based editor and commenting features, students can enjoy the benefits of working alongside their classmates without the pressure of feeling like they are working on top of one another.  (In one class, students even played tunes for each other while they worked).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn times when students want to work without interruption, they can design in their corner of a Figma file while still passively enjoying the benefits of the instructor or classmates observing their work-in-progress files. Onlookers can take notes for later or leave comments on the design itself for asynchronous review. When it comes time for real-time feedback, students can call the instructor or other classmates over to chime in and actually move pixels around with them in the same file. The result is a wellspring of ideas from all participants and more learning for everyone. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"a-permanent-record-of-work\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-permanent-record-of-work\"\u003eA permanent record of work\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLambda’s mission doesn’t end at teaching people new skills. Not only does the school hold off on charging students for the program until they’ve landed a job, but they also match people with expert career coaches, local mentors, and their nationwide network of hiring partners. To show employers what they are capable of, students (especially design students) need a portfolio. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince each student’s designs were created, iterated on, and stored all along the way in Figma, the portfolio-creation process becomes a lot easier.  Figma saves and organizes everything so students can focus on nailing the interview, not sorting through old files to piece together a portfolio. Students also have access to classmates’ work, so even after a lesson, they can continue to learn from each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs design continues to expand its reach and impact, we love seeing programs like Lambda School that educate and support the next generation of designers!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLearn more about \u003ca href=\"https://lambdaschool.com/\"\u003eLambda School on their website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re using Figma in your classroom, we’d love to see how!

In fact, it’s one of the reasons we built Figma on the Web—to create a space where design work is openly available to anyone with a computer and internet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith over 50% of Figma users identifying as non-designers, designers have embraced working with collaborators across teams—developers, product managers, researchers, marketers, and beyond. To help these teams make the most of this open environment, we’re making it easier for designers and their stakeholders to find what they’re looking for. We’re also enabling designers to provide context and navigation within their files to help teammates understand their work. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"easily-find-what-you-re-looking-for\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#easily-find-what-you-re-looking-for\"\u003eEasily find what you’re looking for\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast fall, we \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-community/#creating-communities-inside-your-figma-workspace\"\u003ereoriented the Figma workspace\u003c/a\u003e around designers and their teammates—allowing users to focus on the people and context behind the file instead of navigating by folders and file names. We introduced project, team, and organization pages as well as individual profiles, to help everyone understand the context around each project and make it easier to find each other\u0026#39;s work. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven with these changes we found that the more work you do in Figma and the bigger your team is, the harder it is to find what you’re looking for. To help with this, we’ve built Universal Search so that designers and their teams can more easily navigate their Figma workspace and find what they’re looking for. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsers have always been able to search for files in Figma. Now, they don\u0026#39;t have to know the name of the file to find what they’re looking for—designers and their teammates can also search their workspace for projects, teams, people, and even private plugins. As a user types, they’ll see results in each of these areas, and can filter the results to focus on a specific category.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsers in the Figma Community beta will notice that their search results will also include community files, publishers, and plugins. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve been rolling out Universal Search over the past few weeks, and it’s now available to all Figma users. For designers, this new experience will mean less time searching for work (for yourself, or to send to others!) and more time making. And for the rest of the team, a more intuitive way to find what you’re looking for and stay up to date on the latest design work. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"better-navigation-and-added-context\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#better-navigation-and-added-context\"\u003eBetter navigation and added context\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond helping designers and their teammates find the files they’re looking for, we also want the files themselves to be easier for collaborators to navigate. \u003cem\u003eWhere are the latest designs? Are there early brainstorms I can look at?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesigners can now guide teammates through their work by including Links to any page or frame within their files. One way we’ve been using this here at Figma is by creating a clickable table of contents that orients any new visitor to the design file. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother way links can be useful is to create an index of all relevant product docs and links in a single place. Design work doesn’t exist in a vacuum—it’s almost always part of a larger project with related docs and resources that provide necessary context but live outside of Figma. \u003cem\u003eIs there a related product requirements doc (PRD)? How can I learn more about the user persona we’re building this feature for? \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Links, you can now bring this additional context into Figma, connecting the latest designs with relevant requirements and specs and allowing your design files to be the single source of truth for your project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"BphHjwcXE0gB\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re excited for you to try out these new features.

While some of your users might welcome a change of pace, others may not want to talk. Even if that means temporarily putting a workstream on hold or slowing things down, it’s ok.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"be-prescriptive\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#be-prescriptive\"\u003eBe prescriptive\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs meetings move to calls or video conferencing, you might find yourself relying on more tools to make things happen. Remember that the people you’re talking to have differing comfort levels with technology, and may not be familiar with the apps you’re using. In her presentation, Irene reminded us not to assume that someone knows how to set up a video call: “Even for a lot of us who work in tech, this can be a challenge.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?rect=0,0,1984,1105\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=373\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA slide from Irene Kim’s presentation on remote usability research\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to sending screeners and prep work ahead of time, provide thorough instructions for joining the call and outline what to expect during the session.

Since our founding, we believed that your data should never be locked inside Figma. It’s one of the many reasons we build Figma on the web and provide APIs for other developers to tap into.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-platform/\"\u003ereleased the first web API in 2018\u003c/a\u003e, we noticed that customers like Uber and Github were bringing Figma file data into their internal tooling. One user \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelmcmillan/status/1230795934671548416?s=20\"\u003eeven used Figma as a CMS\u003c/a\u003e!

We believe that designers should have the freedom to fluidly work across their favorite tools. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile many designers do use Figma for their entire workflow — brainstorming, wireframing, designing, prototyping, research, handoff and more — we know that some need specialized tools for more advanced functionality. For example, some of our customers prefer Zeplin’s philosophy on developer handoff to Figma’s, and we’ve loved working with the Zeplin team to bring our tools closer together. When you’re building a product, it’s never a good idea to try and be all things to all people, and we rely on our ecosystem partners to help us fill in the gaps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"prototype-your-figma-files-in-framer-web\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#prototype-your-figma-files-in-framer-web\"\u003ePrototype your Figma files in Framer Web\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, we’re excited to introduce a new integration with Framer Web, where you can now easily import Figma files into Framer Web for more advanced prototyping. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrototyping in Framer Web can help you achieve more expressive interactions.

Last week we shared \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-run-a-remote-brainstorm/\"\u003etips for running a remote brainstorm\u003c/a\u003e, based on our own experience trying to translate offline meetings to an online-only environment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it’s not just about adapting our workflows for a distributed team; since we first made the decision to start working remotely, our top priority has been finding ways to stay connected while far apart. There are so many aspects of working together in an office that don’t feel like work—team offsites, coffee runs, meals—and ultimately make work better, easier, and more fun.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBelow, you’ll find our approach to bringing those offline moments online, and what we do to keep our (currently remote) team feeling like a team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"keeping-your-team-close\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#keeping-your-team-close\"\u003eKeeping your team close\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur office is built to foster a sense of community—the micro-kitchens, lunch area, and open floor plan all allow us to easily connect with teammates. Without those shared spaces, spontaneous run-ins are few and far between. While we can’t sit down for lunch or grab coffee in-person these days, we’ve found ways to recreate those important moments, virtually.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"be-intentional\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#be-intentional\"\u003eBe intentional\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen things are business as usual, some meetings can easily be redirected to a quick email thread or Slack conversation. It’s tempting to fall into the trap of cancelling non-essential syncs, but now we’re trying to think of them as a good excuse to check in on each other. Meetings can still serve an important purpose, even when there’s no formal objective.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"get-leaders-on-the-same-page\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#get-leaders-on-the-same-page\"\u003eGet leaders on the same page\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we first started working remotely a few weeks ago, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/zoink?s=20\"\u003eour CEO, Dylan\u003c/a\u003e, gathered the managers at Figma to brainstorm ways to keep the team close. Leaders across teams offered their tips, from daily morning check-ins to virtual coffees. We’ve also created a Slack channel where managers continue to share learnings, articles, and any other resources that might come in handy. While the approach to remote work looks a little for different each team (and it should!), there’s a shared understanding that we’re all in it together. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?rect=0,0,1652,934\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=379\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA slide that one of our leaders shared with other managers at Figma\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"build-in-moments-of-joy\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#build-in-moments-of-joy\"\u003eBuild in moments of joy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom (optional) team-wide workouts to virtual meetups for dog and cat owners, many of us have been setting aside time to connect with coworkers outside of necessary meetings.

At the end of every All Hands, everyone turns on their video for a few seconds so we can see each other’s faces instead of just names and avatars. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery other week, we all sit down for “Show and Tell,” during which Figmates share their work, tell a story, or teach the rest of the company something they’re passionate about. It’s hard to capture the magic of these meetings online, so at the most recent Show \u0026amp; Tell, we decided to mix it up.

Having a simplified UI Kit (most necessary visual elements) allows students to get started with foundational components before heading over to the exhaustive kit for more specific needs. With a Figma, you can have a master file in your team library that everyone has access to.

While the main goal certainly isn’t maximum productivity, the reality is that many of us—ourselves included!—are still doing work, attempting to find a rhythm in our new (temporary) normal. So, we at Figma have been exploring ways to make that adjustment a little easier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve all been working from home for the past few weeks now, and we’ve been thinking a lot about how to translate the moments that happen in the office to an entirely-remote workforce. It has long been a habit of ours to add a dial-in for our remote colleagues, but we’re not used to a fully-dispersed team. Now that it’s no longer an option to have a quick huddle or whiteboard in a conference room, we’re realizing how challenging it is to run an effective brainstorm (and how frustrating it can sometimes be for our always-remote colleagues). \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"brainstorming-at-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#brainstorming-at-figma\"\u003eBrainstorming at Figma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re lucky that we have a very open, collaborative culture here at Figma. Many of us seek out feedback from our coworkers on all sorts of topics, whether it’s exploring different product directions or fielding ideas for new blog posts. Brainstorms can mean a lot of things. Broadly, we turn to them when we need to hear from different perspectives, riff on concepts with a wider audience, or build out an idea into something more substantial.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCompared to more transactional meetings focused on updates and check-ins, brainstorms require different energy. While they’re not always about creative concepts, they often ask participants to dream up original ideas. That can be tough to do, especially during such an uncertain time. Below, we’re sharing what we’ve learned as we try to keep our brainstorms structured and efficient, while giving our team the space to think creatively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"getting-ready\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#getting-ready\"\u003eGetting ready\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike any other brainstorm, a little prep work will help you get the most out of your time together. Just remember that you might need to pay more attention to the logistical details—when the whole team is remote, it’s particularly important to make sure everyone’s on the same page.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"outline-goals\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#outline-goals\"\u003eOutline goals\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAsk yourself what you’d like to get out of the brainstorm, keeping in mind the phase your project is in. Are you looking to get as many new ideas as possible, or do you need help refining a couple different options? Being clear about your goal will help your teammates understand what level of concepts you need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"get-your-tools-ready-to-go\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#get-your-tools-ready-to-go\"\u003eGet your tools ready to go\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the office, you can find people at their desks or quickly bounce ideas around in a conference room. As we get used to working from home, we’re realizing how much more we’re relying on our tool ecosystem.

While everyone can technically dial in by phone or hide their video, encourage the group to turn on their cameras. Getting a little face time can make everyone feel more connected and open to throwing out new ideas.

Beyond sending meeting notes and keeping the team up to date, you can ask the team for ad hoc feedback and input. Pro tip: paste the link to the working doc in the channel’s “topic” field so everyone can easily find it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"send-the-file-in-advance\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#send-the-file-in-advance\"\u003eSend the file in advance\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome people work better when they have time to reflect on the task, instead of doing it live. Send the file the night before or morning-of with a brief description of what you’re hoping to accomplish. If you have ideas for the team to react to or build on, make sure to flesh those out in the doc. Encourage teammates to ping you directly or comment in the file with questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"running-a-remote-brainstorm\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#running-a-remote-brainstorm\"\u003eRunning a remote brainstorm\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"kick-things-off\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#kick-things-off\"\u003eKick things off\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy this point, you’ve already shared goals and initial thinking with the team. As a quick refresher, or for anyone who hasn’t gotten around to reviewing your materials, remind the group what you’re looking for and how they can help. During the session, it’s possible—likely, in fact—that the group will veer off course at some point. It’s usually a good sign that they’re excited about what you’re talking about! To get things back on track, create a “Parking lot” within your document and direct everyone to write down ideas there that aren’t directly relevant to the conversation, but are worth exploring at a later date.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"run-an-exercise\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#run-an-exercise\"\u003eRun an exercise\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFreeform sessions certainly work, but we’ve found that more structured brainstorms are better when everyone’s remote. If you’re running the session over VC, consider having participants break out into teams of 2-3. Some people are more inclined to chime in when they’re not in a big group, and it’s easier to handle potential technical or communication issues in a smaller forum.

However, there isn’t always a plugin to come to the rescue. Maybe your challenge is too specific to your product or the nuances of your components and styles. So what do you do? Build your own bespoke tools to help you and your team work faster!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the last six months it has been encouraging to see the growth of the plugin community. In addition to the 400+ plugins that are now publicly available, many people have also shared private plugins that are specifically tailored to their own individual and team’s workflows. At \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/reflections-on-config-our-first-user-conference/\"\u003eConfig\u003c/a\u003e, one of our most popular sessions—and one that we certainly underestimated the demand for—centered around this exact topic.

As he encountered these tasks, each eventually became the impetus to build a small utility to make those boring jobs easier (and faster!). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"borders-utility\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#borders-utility\"\u003eBorders utility\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first plugin was a small utility that shows and hides a particular combination of layers in Github’s list item components. Instead of having separate components that would each need to be maintained, each list item component could make use of many divider sizes and placements. This meant that Brian could consolidate all of the divider options into a single group within the component. He then built a plugin to toggle the visibility of the correct divider.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"color-theming\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#color-theming\"\u003eColor theming\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor their \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/mobile\"\u003eupcoming mobile app\u003c/a\u003e the team planned to support light and dark themes, in addition to a high contrast mode (available in both themes) for accessibility. This meant creating and managing four sets of different (but sometimes visually hard to distinguish) colors and repetitively applying each of those functionally named colors with their counterparts in corresponding themes. Brian built a plugin to quickly search and manage the growing list of styles, making it easier for designers to find the right colors. Additionally, the plugin also made it possible to quickly switch entire designs from one theme to another with a couple of clicks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"real-content-and-a-consolidated-approach\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#real-content-and-a-consolidated-approach\"\u003eReal content and a consolidated approach\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eContinuing down this path, adding real content was next. In order to create accurate mockups (and stress test designs), a data population plugin was made to pull live real data from their API directly into designs. The plugin pulls in random samples of data and maps corresponding content, like avatars, usernames, and full names, to layer names in their components. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter building each of these tools, Brian consolidated their functions into a single “mono plugin.” This enabled a more seamless user experience for other designers on the team to install and launch a single plugin UI to access all of these workflow enhancements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"real-content-and-real-avatars-at-atlassian\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#real-content-and-real-avatars-at-atlassian\"\u003eReal content, and  real avatars at Atlassian\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFueled by the fear of unknowingly shipping filler text and imagery to production, Jake Miller, Design Systems Lead at Atlassian, set out to tackle building a content generator for their designers. While there were a few existing plugins for populating designs with more generic text, the design teams at Atlassian needed content specific to their products and data that was linked together (i.e. a project description that would correspond to a project name). The end result: a plugin called ADG Data Generator that enables designers to choose content from whichever product they’re working on. Working on a Jira feature? Projects and ticket numbers! BitBucket? Branches and commit messages! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe plugin can fill in data for users as well, with one twist: instead of using stock imagery—which potentially means shipping a photo of an actual person—the plugin leverages AI-generated images of realistic looking users who aren’t \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e real.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking to build something similar?

The duo has produced over four plugins to help their team in different ways:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"design-crits-for-mobile\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#design-crits-for-mobile\"\u003eDesign crits for mobile\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003ePart of successfully evaluating a mobile design is interacting with it on a device. The team already had a very open and collaborative critique process, but sharing to a large screen made it difficult for each member to get a sense of how the design would feel in the palm of their hands. To make this process easier, they built a plugin that uses a QR code with a URL to mirror whatever frame is selected in Figma, directly to each persons device. Everyone in the crit can now independently experience each design, enabling them to provide more thoughtful feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"color-linter\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#color-linter\"\u003eColor linter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLinting is a tool used by developers to help automate the discovery of programming bugs, syntax errors, and stylistic inconsistencies. Lily and Vietanh decided to bring this concept to Uber’s designers by building a plugin that would find incorrectly applied color styles, and objects without them. The plugin flags them and assists users in picking the right semantically-named colors from their palette. The end result not only helps them reduce errors when developers are inspecting files, but also allows designers to use Uber’s custom light/dark mode plugin to instantly preview any design in the opposite theme with a single command.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"uber-garage-improving-mock-up-quality-with-3d\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#uber-garage-improving-mock-up-quality-with-3d\"\u003eUber Garage: Improving mock-up quality with 3d vehicles\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDue to the wide range of vehicles you can request at Uber, designers had to mockup designs for everything from passenger cars, to scooters, to helicopters. With all these considerations, there’s a limitless combination of perspectives and angles required to accurately situate these vehicles on a map. To solve this, the team built a plugin called Uber Garage which allows a designer to choose a vehicle, rotate a 3-dimensional model to their desired angle and instantly insert it into their design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"watch\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#watch\"\u003eWatch\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWant to watch the full session?

If you aren’t feeling very confident in your design decisions, perhaps you don’t have enough information to really get to work. You can build your confidence up with data, validation, and advice. Talking to peers, people who have solved similar problems, or people who are experiencing the problem first hand will enable you to come to more meaningful conclusions. This is my favorite part of the design process — filling my brain to the absolute brim with every single variable I can find that’s related to the problem. Even when we’re sleeping or “not working,” our brains get to work putting the pieces together, making our solutions more and more obvious as we work through it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExperience\u003c/strong\u003eHere’s the thing nobody wants to hear; sometimes, building confidence just takes time. Our first exercise on childhood fear is a great example of this. Constant practice was the only thing that made me the star reader I am today. We build our experience from doing the thing that is scary over and over again until suddenly it isn’t scary anymore; and that’s confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe journey of building experience, however, is not a straight path. It is a winding and twisting road that spirals around itself multiple times like a spirograph. Designers are often handed the same kinds of problems to solve over and over again throughout their careers. Each time we’re handed one of these problems, we are able to leverage the experience from the past and apply it with nuanced meaning. And with each experience, we create real emotional connections to the outcomes of our past decisions. This emotional connection to our successes and failures is the strongest connection we have to our own feelings of confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"activity-time\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#activity-time\"\u003e✨Activity Time✨\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWrite about an area in your life where you would like to build more confidence today.

Here are a few research best practices to help you get started: \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_1-have-a-target-goal-in-mind-before-you-test\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_1-have-a-target-goal-in-mind-before-you-test\"\u003e1. Have a target goal in mind before you test\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore you even build a prototype, you’ll want to first define what success looks like. Good test goals are specific, quantifiable metrics. Every test is different and therefore may have different goals and targets. But here’s an example: In order to call the test successful, 80% of test subjects need to complete the task(s) successfully and less than 2% can misclick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_2-test-your-test\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_2-test-your-test\"\u003e2. Test your test\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor new features, product teams often run a beta program or do a gradual roll-out. The same best practice applies to user tests, especially if you’re testing with a large population of users. Running a pilot before you start testing with real users ensures that the test works as intended and provides the opportunity to fix any issues that might arise.\u003cbr/\u003eTo run a pilot, you can share your test with your internal teammates, or even friends and family members. Run them through the test as if it’s the real thing to make sure the tasks are clear, the prototype works properly, and the goals are meaningful. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_3-test-with-your-existing-users-and-non-users-too\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_3-test-with-your-existing-users-and-non-users-too\"\u003e3. Test with your existing users—and non-users too\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen running usability tests, some of your best subjects are your existing users. They already know your product and most likely can’t wait to be the first to try out a new feature. They can be your biggest advocates and provide invaluable feedback. To find engaged test subjects, focus on customer segments that would most likely adopt the new feature. \u003cbr/\u003eTesting with existing customers can provide great insights from seasoned users, but you don’t want to bias your research. Don’t forget to also test with non-users to get a fresh pair of eyes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_4-avoid-leading-questions-and-tasks\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_4-avoid-leading-questions-and-tasks\"\u003e4. Avoid leading questions and tasks\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne essential rule for creating usability tasks is to avoid using leading words that guide users toward the answer. Examples of leading words are “click here,” “go to,” or “navigate to,” If you tell a test subject, \u0026#34;Click the Signup button to create an account and go to the Feed page to upload images,\u0026#34; you’re essentially telling them what to do, instead of testing if the user experience is intuitive. A well-phrase task is focused on the end-goal you want the user to achieve and avoids any internal feature lingo. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_5-throw-an-analysis-party\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_5-throw-an-analysis-party\"\u003e5. Throw an analysis party\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen summarizing your user testing results, one of the most challenging aspects of this part of the research phase isn’t necessarily extracting relevant insights, but rather getting buy-in on those findings and agreeing on next steps across your organization. \u003cbr/\u003eSimilar to the benefits of collaborating on design projects, collaborating on the analysis of test results allows the entire product team to discuss their interpretations of the findings and the best actions to take. Maze makes it easy to get everyone involved with reports you can pull instantly and a custom URL you can use to share the data with anyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo dive deeper into the integration details, check out the \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041246514\"\u003egetting started doc\u003c/a\u003e.

To prevent this issue from recurring, we will be improving our monitoring of expensive queries and setting tighter bounds on allowed running time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe root cause of Wednesday’s incident was that a routine change in database statistics caused PostgreSQL 9 to mis-plan the execution of one of our queries, causing expensive table scans and writes to temporary buffers. This was exacerbated by concurrent aggressive autovacuuming operations, which were happening because of a vacuuming backlog from the long-running query that had been terminated on Tuesday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe upgrade to PostgreSQL 11 mitigated both of these causes: improvements to the query planner eliminated the possibility of the bad query plan, and the performance characteristics of autovacuuming have been significantly improved between versions 9 and 11.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a detailed technical explanation of our investigation, conclusions, and next steps, read on…\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"root-cause-analysis-what-caused-the-database\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#root-cause-analysis-what-caused-the-database\"\u003eRoot cause analysis: What caused the database performance problems?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the early stages of the incident, our leading theory was that the performance problems were primarily due to automatic vacuuming. Vacuuming is a routine process that helps maintain database health. Normally it runs automatically and with minimal impact on other database tasks, but in this case, the long-running query that had been cancelled on Tuesday produced a backlog of data to be vacuumed. This crossed the threshold for a more aggressive form of automatic vacuuming intended to prevent transaction ID wraparound. This autovacuum mode has a greater impact on locking and writes, especially in the version of PostgreSQL that we were running.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring the incident, we canceled autovacuum statements running on our largest tables and saw database metrics improve temporarily. However, the stability was short-lived. Eventually autovacuuming would resume, as would write IOPS and lock contention. Fully preventing aggressive autovacuuming required changing the \u003ccode\u003eautovacuum_freeze_max_age\u003c/code\u003e database parameter and rebooting, which we eventually did. (This reboot was responsible for a portion of the downtime between 2 PM-3 PM.) While this brought relative stability to the site, write IOPS, write latency, and lock contention were still higher than normal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next mitigation we discussed was upgrading the version of PostgreSQL we were using. We had two reasons to consider an upgrade:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePostgreSQL 9.6 and later include \u003ca href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/storage-vm.html\"\u003ean important optimization related to autovacuuming\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWith PostgreSQL 10 and later, Amazon RDS (the managed PostgreSQL service we use) offers more sophisticated performance analysis tools that will help us diagnose issues such as this.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe had previously upgraded our staging database to PostgreSQL 11, tested it for several months without issues, and written a detailed plan for performing the upgrade in production. Therefore we felt confident about performing the upgrade even under less than ideal conditions. Given the risk of ongoing instability, we determined that it was best to do the upgrade in the evening rather than waiting until the weekend. Our preparation paid off: the upgrade was successful, and with site stability returned to normal, we could focus fully on diagnosing the root causes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause we continued to see performance issues even after disabling autovacuums, we concluded that while they may have been a contributing factor, they were not the only culprit. We turned our attention to a second factor: an unexpectedly expensive query. During the incident, we had observed that one particular statement with complex subqueries showed up repeatedly as being involved in lock contention. We restored a database snapshot from immediately prior to the database upgrade and examined the query plan for the problematic statement. Several facts about the plan stood out:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe plan was much more expensive than expected. In particular, it estimated that it would return over 20 million rows, when in fact the actual result was only 3 rows. This likely meant that either the query planner was operating on bad statistics about the contents of the tables involved in the query, or that we had encountered a bug or deficiency in the query planner.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe expensive plan performed full table scans where we expected it to use an index, and wrote a large amount of data to temporary buffers, consistent with high write IOPS and temp bytes metrics we observed during the incident.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOn the upgraded database, the plan for the same query predicted row counts accurately, used the expected indexes, and did not write to temporary buffers. This gave us some confidence that the stability we saw post-upgrade was not just a fluke and upgrading had been the right call.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe query was a complex one, generated by our ORM layer. (It’s admittedly more complex than it needs to be, and one of our followup tasks will be to review and optimize this and similarly complex queries.) We removed parts of the query that proved non-essential to replicating the issue, reducing it to a query on the \u003ccode\u003eroles\u003c/code\u003e table with nested sub-selects:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSELECT\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;roles\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFROM\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;roles\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWHERE\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e id \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIN\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eSELECT\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;roles\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFROM\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u0026#34;roles\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e6\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e  \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eWHERE\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e roles\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eid \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eIN\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e7\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith this reduced query, we could quickly investigate hypothesis about the query planner behavior. We restored a database snapshot from several days prior to the incident and observed that the plan for this query on that date had a reasonable estimate (199) for the number of rows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNested Loop  (cost=17055.00..18144.32 rows=199 width=8) (actual time=0.076..0.090 rows=3 loops=1)\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e   -\u0026gt;  HashAggregate  (cost=17054.43..17056.42 rows=199 width=8) (actual time=0.068..0.068 rows=3 loops=1)\n\u003cspan\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e         [...]\n\u003cspan\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e   -\u0026gt;  Index Only Scan using roles_pkey on roles  (cost=0.56..5.45 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.005..0.006 rows=1 loops=3)\n\u003cspan\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e         Index Cond: (id = roles_1.id)\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe fact that the same query had wildly different row estimates at two different times suggested an issue with statistics. Statistics are a form of database metadata the query planner uses to estimate the relative costs of potential query plans. They are updated by the \u003ccode\u003eANALYZE\u003c/code\u003e command, which, like \u003ccode\u003eVACUUM\u003c/code\u003e, is typically run as an automated background process. Looking at data from \u003ccode\u003epg_stat_user_tables\u003c/code\u003e, we observed that one of the tables involved in the query had completed an automatic \u003ccode\u003eANALYZE\u003c/code\u003e  command at exactly the same time as the incident began. And indeed, after we manually ran \u003ccode\u003eANALYZE\u003c/code\u003e on this table on our test database, the query plan went from estimating 199 rows returned to estimating over 20 million:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan\u003e1\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNested Loop  (cost=16161.53..17255.46 rows=20682690 width=8) (actual time=0.098..0.115 rows=3 loops=1)\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2\u003c/span\u003e   -\u0026gt;  HashAggregate  (cost=16160.96..16162.96 rows=200 width=8) (actual time=0.081..0.081 rows=3 loops=1)\n\u003cspan\u003e3\u003c/span\u003e         [...]\n\u003cspan\u003e4\u003c/span\u003e   -\u0026gt;  Index Only Scan using roles_pkey on roles  (cost=0.56..5.44 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.007..0.007 rows=1 loops=3)\n\u003cspan\u003e5\u003c/span\u003e         Index Cond: (id = roles_1.id)\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the original, unreduced query, this bad row estimate had a cascading effect, triggering expensive table scans and writes to temporary buffers. Execution times stretched into multiple minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe now had strong evidence that a change in table statistics had caused the query planner to switch from a good plan to one with catastrophically bad performance. We began to research query planner behavior, and a key turning point in our investigation was the discovery of \u003ca href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAL9smLC_ZfUO1YxEWMoiuxhEA_VriRhk5U1BQj7wXJdWLYXWKA%40mail.gmail.com\"\u003ethis post from the PostgreSQL mailing list\u003c/a\u003e. The symptoms closely matched our own: an inner HashAggregate query crossing a threshold of 200 estimated rows, causing the total estimated number of rows to jump wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBased on the discussion on the mailing list thread, the “deficiency in the query planner” hypothesis now seemed much more likely, and was bolstered by the fact that we were able to replicate a test case in the mailing list post on our test database, but not the upgraded database. Something had evidently been fixed between PostgreSQL 9.5 and 11, but we weren’t sure what. Using the official PostgreSQL Docker images, we bisected PostgreSQL versions. The test case replicated in 9.6.16, but not in 10.0. Reviewing the release notes for 10.0, the following change caught our eye: “Use uniqueness guarantees to optimize certain join types (David Rowley)”. Because the join in our query involved the primary key, we believed the uniqueness guarantee applied to our case. We located \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/9c7f5229ad68d7e0e4dd149e3f80257893e404d4\"\u003ethe relevant commit\u003c/a\u003e, and from it learned that the output of \u003ccode\u003eEXPLAIN VERBOSE\u003c/code\u003e would include the text “Inner Unique: true” when this optimization was in use. We confirmed that on the upgraded database, the plan did include this indicator.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA final question we asked was why the query planner’s row estimate had crossed this critical threshold of 200 at all when the actual row count was only 3. By examining several PostgreSQL snapshots over time, we discovered that PostgreSQL had increasingly underestimated the selectivity of the innermost subquery. \u003ca href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/50DF5920.1090109%40synedra.com\"\u003eAs this article explains\u003c/a\u003e, this can happen because \u003ccode\u003eANALYZE\u003c/code\u003e uses a statistical sample of rows, which may underestimate the number of unique values of a column if the same values for that column tend to be clustered together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt this point, we felt confident we had located the root cause: a routine change in database statistics triggered a deficiency in the PostgreSQL 9 query planner’s row estimates, causing catastrophically expensive table scans and writes to temporary buffers. This was exacerbated by concurrent aggressive autovacuuming, which was triggered due to a vacuuming backlog from a long running query that had been terminated the previous day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re also confident this issue will not recur. The upgrade to PostgreSQL 11 mitigated both of these causes: the query planner is able to take advantage of the uniqueness of the inner relation to avoid the problematic query plan, and the performance characteristics of autovacuuming have been significantly improved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"next-steps\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#next-steps\"\u003eNext steps\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe learned a lot from these incidents and are already working on a number of follow up actions to improve our resilience to future incidents.

It has been updated and republished here.\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Figma, we think design systems are a powerful tool to help democratize and empower entire organizations to be a part of the design process. They enable consistency at scale and help teams deliver better products, faster. But what product design teams have been learning and adopting in terms of design systems has not been as quick to catch on when it comes to marketing and web design. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the newly joined marketing web producer, I began to dissect the pages on our marketing site as well as the process for creating new pages. I realized that we severely lacked the consistency and rigor that we believe to be a best practice for web design. Instead of a repeatable method for building pages and a library with reusable elements, designers and developers were coming up with their own systems and creating brand new solutions, many of which were very similar, though not exact, to solutions already implemented on other pages. Not only was the marketing site difficult to maintain and update, it felt inconsistent for our users. It was time to build a system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"taking-inventory\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#taking-inventory\"\u003eTaking inventory\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur first step was to take stock of what we had – fonts, sizes, colors, column widths, layouts, and so on. We started compiling all of that information into a Figma file, and from there, it was easy to see overlaps, or in other words, repeated applications of patterns that just needed to be unified. We also spotted the outliers, or those components that had been used only once, and therefore didn’t have a place in our style guide. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome of the repeated elements were quite large, so we dissected them down to an atomic level, which would allow anyone using the design system to then piece the atoms and molecules together to form organisms that fit the needs of any page and the content that needed to live there. It was very important for us to end up with flexible building blocks that could work in conjunction with one another in any combination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also looked for elements that were similar, but not exactly the same, and agreed on one style. So, instead of 12 different sizes for headings, we established an H1-H3, body copy, and technical copy styles. We did the same for our blog and other long form content, adding styles such as pull quotes and block quotes. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we interpreted and refined the visual language we’d already created, it was a pretty simple exercise to organize all the components in a shared library so that a person with little design experience or familiarity with Figma’s brand could create something that looked and felt cohesive with the rest of our site. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-simplified-flexible-design-system\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-simplified-flexible-design-system\"\u003eA simplified, flexible design system\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the course of a month, our small team created and organized a robust, adaptable style guide and component library that now lives in our CMS, Contentful. Everything is consistent across the board—typography, sizes, padding, line heights, colors, and grid. Now, when the design team goes to create a new page, they’ve got flexible building blocks right at their fingertips. Building an H1 is as easy as grabbing it from the design system. We’ve also begun to “componentize” commonly paired elements and fully assembled sections using the elements from our system. We call these larger organisms “FLEGOs” (Figma + LEGO) and you can check them out in this \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/file/799433873230303935/\"\u003epublic file\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"getting-to-market-faster\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#getting-to-market-faster\"\u003eGetting to market faster\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe majority of Figma’s core marketing site is now built with this framework. Using our design system through Contentful, we can go from concept to ship in one day and can do that without the need for any new code. For example, when we wanted to create a \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/whats-new/\"\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s New page\u003c/a\u003e, the product marketer who originally had the idea and I made a quick wireframe using the FLEGOs, collaborated on the copy directly in the Figma file, and then built out the page using the components in our CMS. We went from idea to a live web page in less than 48 hours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?rect=0,0,1173,1332\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=761\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1173w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA portion of the What\u0026#39;s New page that was built using FLEGOs\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, when we want to make a universal change to an atom or molecule, we can do it once in Contentful, rather than getting a developer to hunt through every page to make dozens of updates directly.

The prompts for each scenario were written to describe tasks the user should be able to do and did not prescribe what the designer should be creating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe measured the time it took to complete each task and participants decided for themselves what was an appropriate stopping point to control for quality across both tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-result\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-result\"\u003eThe Result\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe found that when participants had access to a design system they completed their objective \u003cstrong\u003e34% faster\u003c/strong\u003e than without a design system.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to call out that the design system used in this experiment was directly applicable to the task the designers were given; it was up-to-date and relevant to what they were working on. As a result, we expect that this time-savings finding is the maximum time savings one would find in a real-world scenario. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wanted to take this time-savings result one step further to make it more tangible for a real design team, like the one here at Figma. Figma has 7 Product Designers and based on their calendars they each get about 20 hours of focused design time per week, for a total of 140 design hours per week. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis means that if \u003cstrong\u003enone of the tasks they’re working on\u003c/strong\u003e have a relevant design system, they are able to do 140 hours of design work a week. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, if \u003cstrong\u003eevery task they’re working on\u003c/strong\u003e has a relevant design system, they are able to do 34% more design work in that 140 hours, giving them 212 design hours. That’s equivalent to adding another 3.5 designers to the team each week!\u003cbr/\u003eIn reality, Figma’s design team is probably somewhere in between, as they are using a design system that is relevant for some tasks and not others. As we evolve our design system to cover more use cases, and work to ensure all designers on the team are using it consistently, we can expect this to increase. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"investing-in-your-design-systems\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#investing-in-your-design-systems\"\u003eInvesting in your design systems\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the value of design systems is generally accepted, our goal with this experiment was to take a quantitative approach to make that value more tangible. In addition to the time savings, this experiment also revealed a more qualitative benefit. Several participants commented that they felt more confident in their final design when they had access to the design system because they knew it was consistent with the product. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the confirmation that design systems truly are worth the investment, it becomes more critical that design systems teams have the resources they need to make the best decisions when building and evolving their design systems. Figma’s unique insight into design system usage informs these decisions, enabling teams to build more relevant and up-to-date design systems that will have a meaningful impact on their designers’ efficiency.

Front-end programmers read classic design theory books and studied basic usability principles. Graphic designers taught themselves to code. Classically trained graduates from design colleges created websites for local businesses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s no wonder then that as design matures in the industry, it’s splintering into many specializations, from research, to design systems, to UX writing, to growth. \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/michelephant\"\u003eMichelle Morrison\u003c/a\u003e, a senior design program manager at Dropbox, pointed out that in the past, one or two people might have done all of these jobs at a company. “Now we have full-stack design teams that can go deep on these problems,” she said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs design evolved, so did design tooling.

Disclaimer ;).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore 2010, most people who needed to design apps and interfaces were using Photoshop -- which literally has the word ‘photo’ in its name. That posed challenges, because digital design is a lot different than print. For example, print graphics appear on physical objects of a fixed size, but digital graphics are represented on screens of many different sizes (especially once mobile hit). For awhile, designers leaned on an Adobe screen design tool called Fireworks, but they discontinued it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"a-dizzying-array-of-options\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-dizzying-array-of-options\"\u003eA dizzying array of options\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo everyone welcomed the launch of UI design tool Sketch, bootstrapped out of Europe in 2010.

Some applications focused on a particular type of design, like websites (Webflow) or new audiences like non-designers (Canva). Adobe introduced XD - its answer to the broader UI design need.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Meng To put it: “It’s both amazing and overwhelming to designers.

We took an unconventional approach by building our professional UI design tool on the web. It had never been done before, in part because browser technology had been limited in its graphic processing abilities. But in 2011, the advent of a Javascript API \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL\"\u003ecalled WebGL\u003c/a\u003e made it possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s fair to say that at first people thought we were crazy for putting a design tool in the browser (just \u003ca href=\"https://www.designernews.co/stories/74791-figma-10\"\u003echeck out the comments on DesignerNews\u003c/a\u003e from our 2016 launch out of beta). \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/johnolilly\"\u003eJohn Lilly\u003c/a\u003e, the investor at Greylock who led our Series A in 2015, took a chance on us anyway. His decision was motivated by the fact that a browser-based tool could open up the design process to everyone, like Google Docs for visual collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s the direction we went in, and after we honed our tool for designers, we launched a code panel for developer handoff and prototyping mode for user testing and presentations. Because files could be shared by a URL, and there were no exporting-syncing challenges, a Figma file became a source of truth that designers, engineers, product managers, copy-writers, and others could work together in. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs John put it: “Designing products, like everything else we do, is a team sport, but it was held back by the tooling.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"the-design-arms-race\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-design-arms-race\"\u003eThe design arms race\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTools have the power to change the way we think and what we can accomplish (as Wilson Miner explored in \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/34017777\"\u003ehis excellent 2011 talk\u003c/a\u003e). And every design tool launched in the last decade has expanded the opportunities and possibilities for interface design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the last few years, venture capital investors cottoned onto the opportunity. Just in the professional UI design tool industry, 7 startups have raised over half a billion in venture from 20+ firms, and much of that happened in the last year alone. \u003ca href=\"https://www.cbinsights.com/research/top-venture-capital-partners/\"\u003eFive of the top venture capital firms\u003c/a\u003e have placed their bets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI asked John — who was relatively early to the space in 2015 — why he thinks design is the new VC passion. “I always think of Willie Sutton’s response to the question of why he robbed banks,” John said. “‘Because that’s where the money is.’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-comes-next\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-comes-next\"\u003eWhat comes next?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWow, what a journey.

In the past 10 years, a lot of concerns have been raised about technology’s impact, from digital addiction to the spread of fake news. Many people we interviewed mentioned the moral responsibilities that lie ahead. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Designers need to look to communities (typically underserved communities) that have long considered the ethics of designed objects, tangible and intangible,” said \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/amelielamont\"\u003eAmélie Lamont\u003c/a\u003e, who runs a \u003ca href=\"https://amelie.is/\"\u003eproduct design studio\u003c/a\u003e out of Brooklyn. She cautioned the industry against thinking of design ethics as a “new” idea. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe topic felt like it deserved its own story, instead of being shoe-horned into an already lengthy exploration of the past decade, so stay tuned for that follow-on.

Lists can rearrange themselves when items are moved around. And elements can be nested to create complex interfaces which respond to their content.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuilding Auto Layout has been a fun but long journey for us. It’s something we’ve wanted to do for a while, but it took quite a few design iterations for it to feel right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-challenge-of-bringing-design-and-development\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-challenge-of-bringing-design-and-development\"\u003eThe challenge of bringing design and development together\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt its heart, Figma is a design tool. It enables free-form exploration using core concepts like paths, layers, and groups. But this free-form nature can lead to lots of repetitive work. For example, a seemingly simple update to button text takes far too many steps—edit text, resize button, move adjacent button, and so on. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeanwhile, production environments like HTML/CSS and SwiftUI are much better at describing the structure of a UI and the relationships between objects—which makes changing things like button copy far less painstaking. However, free-form design exploration is near impossible in these environments. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo in building our Auto Layout feature, we wanted to marry these two worlds. How do we combine the ease of making edits in production while preserving the free-form nature of Figma?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike many design challenges, the end result may look obvious in hindsight. After trying many different approaches, including some rather non-conventional ones, we felt the best way to marry the two worlds was to add a few core concepts from the CSS box model (specifically flexbox) directly into Figma. And by introducing Auto Layout as a property, you have the flexibility and power to apply Auto Layout to any frame, whether it’s in a component or not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"how-auto-layout-works\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how-auto-layout-works\"\u003eHow Auto Layout works\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you add Auto Layout to a frame, the items inside are stacked next to each other (either vertically or horizontally). The frame\u0026#39;s size is then determined by the total size of the items within it. Auto Layout frames can have their own padding, fill, stroke and corner radius, so you can create buttons without adding additional layers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis makes last minute requests like tweaking button copy from “Buy” to “Add to basket” a breeze. As you edit the text, the frame resizes automatically. And if you stack some buttons next to each other, they all move as you would expect. (Note: the one difference from the CSS model is that spacing between items is done at a container level. If you need to adjust the spacing between individual items, you will need to do a little bit of extra work.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eGenerally speaking, Auto Layout is just pure genius.

When small businesses thrive, people thrive, and that’s where \u003ca href=\"https://gusto.com/company-news/gusto-brand-refresh\"\u003eGusto\u003c/a\u003e comes in. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLaunched in 2012 as ZenPayroll, Gusto serves more than 100,000 small businesses, helping them take care of their hardworking teams by automating and simplifying payroll, benefits and human resources. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Gusto’s customers love the platform, the company didn’t feel that its brand truly reflected the human experience of how Gusto serves its customers. The time was right for a \u003ca href=\"https://gusto.com/brand\"\u003ebrand refresh\u003c/a\u003e that would unite the company in its brand awareness, product development and customer experience efforts.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a look at how Gusto used Figma to create a top-to-bottom brand experience that’s all about people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"believing-in-the-re-brand\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#believing-in-the-re-brand\"\u003eBelieving in the (re)brand\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo help it reach even greater numbers of small businesses, Gusto needed to grow its brand awareness.

Will Tsui, product design lead at Gusto, highlighted a moment when the culture of collaboration really came to life. “A designer on our Design Systems team led a working session called Refresca with the whole team, along with real Fresca refreshments.

Tsui believes that Figma was instrumental in facilitating the translation from brand to product. “Our goal was not just to represent the new brand throughout the product experience. We wanted to go above and beyond by choosing special moments to bring the brand forward in inspiring ways,” he says. In having the two teams equally involved in the early stage of the rebrand, the process of applying the new brand to every aspect of the product experience was seamless.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"scaling-design-efforts-across-products\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#scaling-design-efforts-across-products\"\u003eScaling design efforts across products\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother goal of the rebrand was to align on how designers would work together and build the supporting systems that could scale with the company.

Traditionally, designers worked in siloed desktop applications that only ran on certain types of platforms. If other people didn’t have the tool downloaded and installed, they couldn’t access the work. Designers had to export files and switch to other third party tools for prototyping and developer handoff. As they iterated and shuffled files across these systems, it became easy to lose track of the latest version, making collaborative teamwork painful if not impossible. Very 1990s. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn contrast, each design file in Figma is a living, breathing entity that is constantly evolving. The design lives in the cloud and has a unique URL, so it serves as the source of truth for the entire team. Different people across the organization can collaborate on the design, provide feedback, check in to see how the work is evolving, or flag issues that might occur down the line in implementation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlus, Figma has prototyping and developer handoff features baked natively into the tool, so stakeholders can view prototypes and developers can pull data from that same source of truth file. In other words, no more questioning whether you’re looking at the latest version of the work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo enable effective team collaboration, Figma has a \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/\"\u003emultiplayer functionality\u003c/a\u003e that allows multiple people to simultaneously view / edit a file. The files often involve complex shapes and big images, resulting in large amounts of data that must be sent across the network to the backend infrastructure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesigners come to Figma from standalone desktop applications, and they expect comparable or better interaction performance. Add all these factors together and you have fertile ground for intriguing technical challenges. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMultiplayer in action\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"infrastructure-2-0\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#infrastructure-2-0\"\u003eInfrastructure 2.0\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur infrastructure was built for an early world, when Figma was used by smaller teams. Back then, we relied on simple strategies to build our back-end, enabling us to be very nimble. For example, we loaded all the shared components available to a user in Figma during file load. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis strategy works well when you have access to thousands of \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/66-components\"\u003eshared design elements\u003c/a\u003e in your organization’s library, but the back-end system starts to strain as the number of design elements nears 10,000.

Below is a brief overview of some of the projects underway or planned.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"speeding-up-interaction-latencies\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#speeding-up-interaction-latencies\"\u003eSpeeding up interaction latencies\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned above, there are still a number of places where the Figma app preloads more data upfront than is necessary to get users into their files. Doing so puts a strain on the back-end, and addressing the problem isn’t trivial — many parts of our product have come to rely on it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a result, it’s not just about speeding up the back end — we need to redesign the entire client-server interaction so the client asks for information only as needed. This will require collaborating with other teams at Figma to rethink the user experience. It’s an exciting opportunity — in this fast-moving industry, it’s not every day that an infrastructure team can take such a thoughtful, holistic approach to scaling a product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"scaling-the-database\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#scaling-the-database\"\u003eScaling the database\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of things people are most shocked to learn about Figma’s infrastructure is that it’s backed by a single database instance running on one of the beefiest machine in AWS. Surprising, right? We are a big fan of the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\"\u003eKISS design principle\u003c/a\u003e and this simple approach has gotten us pretty far. But we’re reaching the limits of what such an architecture can support, so we need to build a new database layer that scales horizontally. This is a big and hairy project, and we’ll need to think through the implications for all the systems and services that rely on the database (which is pretty much everything!).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"performance-for-international-users\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#performance-for-international-users\"\u003ePerformance for international users\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore than 80% of our weekly active users are outside the US. Their interaction latencies are a function of round-trip time to our datacenter in Oregon. To speed up their experience, we want to deploy certain infrastructure components closer to users. As a first step we’ll be strategically placing remote proxies across the globe. Next, we’ll be experimenting with deploying instances of our Multiplayer service closer to our users. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Figma’s infrastructure, a design file is mapped to one instance of Multiplayer. As we expand internationally, we’ll need to figure out the best datacenter for each document according to user location. Working on a system that spans multiple datacenters makes for fun, complex problem solving. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"livegraph\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#livegraph\"\u003eLiveGraph\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur most ambitious undertaking is a schema-based, real-time database system called LiveGraph, which is inspired by GraphQL. Our goal with this project is to make it easier for engineers across Figma to build new responsive features in our tool. Currently, our developers must build specialized backend and frontend systems for each one. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLiveGraph obviates the need for that by detecting relevant changes in the underlying database, filtering updates based on client’s access permissions and pushing relevant updates to the client in real-time.  In other words, it allows a client to subscribe to a query and receive push notifications whenever the results of the query change. Over time we expect it to become a core part of our infrastructure that powers several features such as relaying new user comments, newly published design elements, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"we-re-hiring\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#we-re-hiring\"\u003eWe’re hiring!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are just a few examples of the kinds of systems we will build along the way towards a more mature infrastructure that is performant and scalable. We’re also containerizing our services, offering APIs for our customers to built custom workflows around Figma, etc. Of course we continue to be responsible for security, our machine footprint in AWS, and continuous integration / deployment system. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eShaping the evolution of a company’s infrastructure is one of the most educative experiences one can have — you not only get a chance to rebuild core components from scratch but also learn to brutally prioritize the investments you make due to finite Engineering resources. We’re a small team, so you can have a big impact and get hands-on experience designing and building a lot of different systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf any of this captures your interest, we’re building out the infrastructure team now.

Today, we’re introducing Design System Analytics to make it easier for companies like Microsoft, Squarespace, or any \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/organization/\"\u003eFigma Organization\u003c/a\u003e customer to build and maintain their design systems with data. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesign System Analytics enables you to see library usage trends, compare libraries, and drill into component usage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile building this feature, we worked closely with several customers to learn what they wanted out of analytics and what they didn’t. As a result, we focused on building analytics that illuminate how your design systems are used across your teams, without policing designers’ every move. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are some examples from our beta customers about what they’re learning from analytics and how they’re taking action on these insights.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"learn-what-s-working-and-what-s-not\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#learn-what-s-working-and-what-s-not\"\u003eLearn what’s working, and what’s not\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith insights into library and component usage, design system managers can make ongoing improvements with quantitative feedback. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMicrosoft’s Damien Aistrope, Principal Designer on the Fluent design system, explains, “There are so many teams at Microsoft using Fluent, and we don’t always get feedback from them about what’s working and what’s not. So it’s helpful for us to see which components aren’t being used and not important to maintain, as well as which components are often detached and may need updating.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Google, this type of data feedback is helping teams uncover new opportunities to evolve components on an ongoing basis. When reviewing the new analytics reports, Philippe Cao, a Senior Visual Designer on the Material Design Team, discovered that the button component was used and detached more than any other component. This helped him realize that the master component was overly complex and that he should create a simpler version in addition to it, giving designers on his team the flexibility they needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"understand-how-libraries-are-used\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#understand-how-libraries-are-used\"\u003eUnderstand how libraries are used\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the ability to compare the usage of two libraries over time, Design System Analytics can also help you keep a pulse on library adoption.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, the Design Platform Team at Squarespace is working on replacing an existing shared library with a new version that makes use of our upcoming \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1176150305379160065\"\u003eAuto-Layout\u003c/a\u003e capabilities. \u003cbr/\u003eWith Design System Analytics, they’ll be able to track adoption of the new library across teams as well as ensure deprecation of the old version.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=477\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eCompare usage of two libraries over time to track migration.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoing beyond just library usage trends, you can also dig into how individual components are being used.

No other design tool offered this feature, and we didn’t want to use operational transforms (a.k.a. OTs), the standard multiplayer algorithm popularized by apps like Google Docs. As a startup we value the ability to ship features quickly, and OTs were unnecessarily complex for our problem space. So we built a custom multiplayer system that\u0026#39;s simpler and easier to implement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the time, we weren’t sure building this feature was the right product decision. No one was clamoring for a multiplayer design tool — if anything, people hated the idea. Designers worried that live collaborative editing would result in “hovering art directors” and “design by committee” catastrophes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut ultimately, we had to do it because it just felt wrong not to offer multiplayer as a tool on the web. It eliminates the need to export, sync, or email copies of files and allows more people to take part in the design process (like copy-writers and developers). Just by having the right link, everyone can view the current status of a design project without interrupting the person doing the work.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur bet paid off, and these days it’s obvious that multiplayer is the way all productivity tools on the web should work, not just design. But while we use products with live collaborative editing every day, there aren’t that many public case studies on these production systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe decided it was time to share a peek into how we did it at Figma, in the hopes of helping others. It should be a fun read for those who like seeing how computer science theory is applied in practice. We’ll cover a lot but each section builds upon the previous ones. By the end, you should hopefully have an understanding of the entire system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"background-context-figma-s-setup-ots-and-more\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#background-context-figma-s-setup-ots-and-more\"\u003eBackground context: Figma’s setup, OTs, and more\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore talking about our multiplayer protocol, it\u0026#39;s useful to have some context about how our multiplayer system is set up. We use a client/server architecture where Figma clients are web pages that talk with a cluster of servers over WebSockets. Our servers currently spin up a separate process for each multiplayer document which everyone editing that document connects to. If you’re interested in learning more, \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/\"\u003ethis article\u003c/a\u003e talks about how we scale our production multiplayer servers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen a document is opened, the client starts by downloading a copy of the file. From that point on, updates to that document in both directions are synced over the WebSocket connection. Figma lets you go offline for an arbitrary amount of time and continue editing. When you come back online, the client downloads a fresh copy of the document, reapplies any offline edits on top of this latest state, and then continues syncing updates over a new WebSocket connection. This means that connecting and reconnecting are very simple and all of the complexity with multiplayer (which is what this blog post is about) is in dealing with updates to already connected documents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s worth noting that we only use multiplayer for syncing changes to Figma documents. We also sync changes to a lot of other data (comments, users, teams, projects, etc.) but that is stored in Postgres, not our multiplayer system, and is synced with clients using a completely separate system that won’t be discussed in this article. Although these two systems are similar, they have separate implementations because of different tradeoffs around certain properties such as performance, offline availability, and security.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe didn\u0026#39;t start with this setup though. When making a change this fundamental, it\u0026#39;s important to be able to iterate quickly and experiment before committing to an approach. That\u0026#39;s why we first created a prototype environment to test our ideas instead of working in the real codebase. This playground was a web page that simulated three clients connecting to a server and visualized the whole state of the system. It let us easily set up different scenarios around offline clients and bandwidth limited connections. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we figured out how we wanted to build our multiplayer system, it was straightforward to graft the ideas from our prototype onto our existing codebase. We used this prototype to quickly research and evaluate different collaborative algorithms and data structures.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?rect=0,0,1500,750\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=335\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA screenshot of our internal prototype\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"how-ots-and-crdts-informed-our-multiplayer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how-ots-and-crdts-informed-our-multiplayer\"\u003eHow OTs and CRDTs informed our multiplayer approach\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMultiplayer technology has a rich history and has arguably been around at least since \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos\"\u003eDouglas Engelbart\u0026#39;s demo in 1968\u003c/a\u003e. Before we dive in too deep into how our own multiplayer system works, it’s worth a quick overview on the traditional approaches that informed ours — OTs and CRDTs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned earlier, OTs power most collaborative text-based apps such as Google Docs. They’re the most well-known technique but in researching them, we quickly realized they were overkill for what we wanted to achieve. They’re a great way of editing long text documents with low memory and performance overhead, but they are very complicated and hard to implement correctly. They result in a combinatorial explosion of possible states which is \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation#Critique_of_OT\"\u003every difficult to reason about\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur primary goal when designing our multiplayer system was for it to be no more complex than necessary to get the job done. A simpler system is easier to reason about which then makes it easier to implement, debug, test, and maintain. Since Figma isn\u0026#39;t a text editor, we didn\u0026#39;t need the power of OTs and could get away with something less complicated. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma\u0026#39;s tech is instead inspired by something called CRDTs, which stands for \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type\"\u003eConflict-free Replicated Data Types\u003c/a\u003e. CRDTs refer to a collection of different data structures commonly used in distributed systems. All CRDTs satisfy certain mathematical properties which guarantee eventual consistency. If no more updates are made, eventually everyone accessing the data structure will see the same thing. This constraint is required for correctness; we cannot allow two clients editing the same Figma document to diverge and never converge again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are many types of CRDTs. See \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/pfrazee/crdt_notes/tree/68c5fe81ade109446a9f4c24e03290ec5493031f#portfolio-of-basic-crdts\"\u003ethis list\u003c/a\u003e for a good overview. Some examples:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGrow-only set:\u003c/strong\u003e This is a set of elements. The only type of update is to add something to the set. Adding something twice is a no-op, so you can determine the contents of the set by just applying all of the updates in any order.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLast-writer-wins register:\u003c/strong\u003e This is a container for a single value. Updates can be implemented as a new value, a timestamp, and a peer ID. You can determine the value of the register by just taking the value of the latest update (using the peer ID to break a tie).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma isn\u0026#39;t using true CRDTs though. CRDTs are designed for decentralized systems where there is no single central authority to decide what the final state should be. There is some unavoidable performance and memory overhead with doing this. Since Figma is centralized (our server is the central authority), we can simplify our system by removing this extra overhead and benefit from a faster and leaner implementation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s also worth noting that Figma\u0026#39;s data structure isn\u0026#39;t a single CRDT. Instead it\u0026#39;s inspired by multiple separate CRDTs and uses them in combination to create the final data structure that represents a Figma document (described below).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven if you have a client-server setup, CRDTs are still worth researching because they provide a well-studied, solid foundation to start with. Understanding them helps build intuition on how to create a correct system. From that point, it\u0026#39;s possible to relax some of the requirements of CRDTs based on the needs of the application as we have done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"how-a-figma-document-is-structured\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how-a-figma-document-is-structured\"\u003eHow a Figma document is structured\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOk, so we want to sync updates to Figma documents using CRDTs. What does the structure of a Figma document even look like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery Figma document is a tree of objects, similar to the HTML DOM. There is a single root object that represents the entire document. Underneath the root object are page objects, and underneath each page object is a hierarchy of objects representing the contents of the page. This tree is is presented in the layers panel on the left-hand side of the Figma editor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach object has an ID and a collection of properties with values. One way to think about this is by picturing the document as a two-level map: \u003ccode\u003eMap\u0026lt;ObjectID, Map\u0026lt;Property, Value\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e. Another way to think about this is a database with rows that store \u003ccode\u003e(ObjectID, Property, Value)\u003c/code\u003e tuples. This means that adding new features to Figma usually just means adding new properties to objects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-details-of-figma-s-multiplayer-system\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-details-of-figma-s-multiplayer-system\"\u003eThe details of Figma’s multiplayer system\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the rest of this post, we will talk about the details of Figma\u0026#39;s multiplayer algorithm and how we solved some of the edge cases we encountered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"syncing-object-properties\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#syncing-object-properties\"\u003eSyncing object properties\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma’s multiplayer servers keep track of the latest value that any client has sent for a given property on a given object. This means that two clients changing unrelated properties on the same object won’t conflict, and two clients changing the same property on unrelated objects also won’t conflict. A conflict happens when two clients change the same property on the same object, in which case the document will just end up with the last value that was sent to the server. This approach is similar to a last-writer-wins register in CRDT literature except we don’t need a timestamp because the server can define the order of events.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eAn animation showing two clients sending updates without any conflicts\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e \u003cbr/\u003eAn important consequence of this is that changes are atomic at the property value boundary. The eventually consistent value for a given property is always a value sent by one of the clients. This is why simultaneous editing of the same text value doesn’t work in Figma. If the text value is B and someone changes it to AB at the same time as someone else changes it to BC, the end result will be either AB or BC but never ABC. That’s ok with us because Figma is a design tool, not a text editor, and this use case isn’t one we’re optimizing for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most complicated part of this is how to handle conflicts on the client when there’s a conflicting change. Property changes on the client are always applied immediately instead of waiting for acknowledgement from the server since we want Figma to feel as responsive as possible. However, if we do this and we also apply every change from the server as it comes in, conflicting changes will sometimes \u0026#34;flicker\u0026#34; when older acknowledged values temporarily overwrite newer unacknowledged ones. We want to avoid this flickering behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIntuitively, we want to show the user our best prediction of what the eventually-consistent value will be. Since our change we just sent hasn’t yet been acknowledged by the server but all changes coming from the server have been, our change is our best prediction because it’s the most recent change we know about in last-to-the-server order. So we want to discard incoming changes from the server that conflict with unacknowledged property changes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eAn animation showing how to avoid “flickering” during a conflict between two clients\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"syncing-object-creation-and-removal\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#syncing-object-creation-and-removal\"\u003eSyncing object creation and removal\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreating a new object and removing an existing object are both explicit actions in our protocol. Objects cannot automatically be brought into existence by writing a property to an unassigned object ID. Removing an object deletes all data about it from the server including all of its properties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eObject creation in Figma is most similar to a last-writer-wins set in CRDT literature, where whether an object is in the set or not is just another last-writer-wins boolean property on that object. A big difference from this model is that Figma doesn’t store any properties of deleted objects on the server. That data is instead stored in the undo buffer of the client that performed the delete. If that client wants to undo the delete, then it’s also responsible for restoring all properties of the deleted objects. This helps keep long-lived documents from continuing to grow in size as they are edited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis system relies on clients being able to generate new object IDs that are guaranteed to be unique. This can be easily accomplished by assigning every client a unique client ID and including that client ID as part of newly-created object IDs. That way no two clients will ever generate the same object ID. Note that we can’t solve this by having the server assign IDs to newly-created objects because object creation needs to be able to work offline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"syncing-trees-of-objects\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#syncing-trees-of-objects\"\u003eSyncing trees of objects\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eArranging objects in an eventually-consistent tree structure is the most complicated part of our multiplayer system. The complexity comes from what to do about reparenting operations (moving an object from one parent to another). When designing the tree structure, we had two main goals in mind:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eReparenting an object shouldn’t conflict with changes to unrelated properties on those objects. If someone is changing the object’s color while someone else is reparenting the object, those two operations should both succeed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTwo concurrent reparenting operations for the same object shouldn’t ever result in two copies of that object in separate places in the tree.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany approaches represent reparenting as deleting the object and recreating it somewhere else with a new ID, but that doesn\u0026#39;t work for us because concurrent edits would be dropped when the object\u0026#39;s identity changes. The approach we settled on was to represent the parent-child relationship by storing a link to the parent as a property on the child. That way object identity is preserved. We also don’t need to deal with the situation where an object somehow ends up with multiple parents that we might have if, say, we instead had each parent store links to its children.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, we now have a new problem. Without any other restrictions, these parent links are just directed edges on a graph. There’s nothing to ensure that they have no cycles and form a valid tree. An example of this is a concurrent edit where one client makes A a child of B while another client makes B a child of A. Then A and B are both each other’s parent, which forms a cycle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma’s multiplayer servers reject parent property updates that would cause a cycle, so this issue can’t happen on the server. But it can still happen on the client. Clients can’t reject changes from the server because the server is the ultimate authority on what the document looks like. So a client could end up in a state where it has both sent the server an unacknowledged change to parent A under B and also received a change from the server that parents B under A. The client’s change will be rejected in the future by the server because it will form a cycle, but the client doesn’t know it yet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eAn animation of a reparenting conflict\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma’s solution is to temporarily parent these objects to each other and remove them from the tree until the server rejects the client’s change and the object is reparented where it belongs. This solution isn’t great because the object temporarily disappears, but it’s a simple solution to a very rare temporary problem so we didn’t feel the need to try something more complicated here such as breaking these temporary cycles on the client.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo construct a tree we also need a way of determining the order of the children for a given parent. Figma uses a technique called “fractional indexing” to do this. At a high level, an object’s position in its parent’s array of children is represented as a fraction between 0 and 1 exclusive. The order of an object’s children is determined by sorting them by their positions. You can insert an object between two other objects by setting its position to the average of the positions of the two other objects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eAn animation of reordering using fractional indexing\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve already written \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/realtime-editing-of-ordered-sequences/#fractional-indexing\"\u003eanother article\u003c/a\u003e that describes this technique in detail. The important part to mention here is that the parent link and this position must both be stored as a single property so they update atomically. It doesn’t make sense to continue to use the position from one parent when the parent is updated to point somewhere else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"implementing-undo\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#implementing-undo\"\u003eImplementing undo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eUndo history has a natural definition for single-player mode, but undo in a multiplayer environment is inherently confusing. If other people have edited the same objects that you edited and then undo, what should happen? Should your earlier edits be applied over their later edits? What about redo?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe had a lot of trouble until we settled on a principle to help guide us: if you undo a lot, copy something, and redo back to the present (a common operation), the document should not change. This may seem obvious but the single-player implementation of redo means “put back what I did” which may end up overwriting what other people did next if you’re not careful. This is why in Figma an undo operation modifies redo history at the time of the undo, and likewise a redo operation modifies undo history at the time of the redo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eAn animation showing undo and redo history modification\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-big-takeaways\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-big-takeaways\"\u003eThe big takeaways\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#39;ve covered a lot!

Especially when you’re a company that’s rooted in design—there’s an added pressure to get it right. For us to get it right, collaboration was a major theme. In fact, collaboration was the colorful thread that tied the whole process together. From the pushing-the-envelope brainstorms that involved our cross-functional teams, to the methodology behind the new illustrations, to the way we used Figma itself to bring our ideas to life. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s how we landed on Figma’s new look and feel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"evolving-figma-s-brand-language\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#evolving-figma-s-brand-language\"\u003eEvolving Figma’s brand language\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI joined Figma about a year ago with the goal to evolve the brand. Of course, I was familiar with Figma, but as I started dissecting the brand language under this lens, I realized there was a lot of great work that already existed. We didn’t need to start from scratch, we just needed to give Figma a longer runway than it currently had. The foundational brand language already had strong pillars conceptually and value-wise, but when they were established, Figma was a new and smaller company. We needed an expansive brand language that would match how much the company has grown. For example, we have a blog now. If a designer is working on a visual for the blog, what rules should the image follow? We took the limited brand guide that existed and added new pages and chapters. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor that reason, what you see in the refresh won’t feel like it’s out of left field. It’ll look and feel like it’s still orbiting the same sun because we took inspiration from what already existed and gave it new wings. We’re taking those original ideas and hitting different angles and points and dialing up certain things. Like the shapes, for example. They’ve always been a part of Figma’s brand, but with the refresh, we found new places they could live and new ways they could be used that still made sense. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"establishing-figma-s-personality\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#establishing-figma-s-personality\"\u003eEstablishing Figma’s personality\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we designed anything, we started with a lot of research to nail down our strategy. In this process, it helped to think of Figma the brand as a living entity to better bring it to life in our minds. If Figma were a person, how does it walk and talk, and breathe and live? It might wear different clothes every day, but it still has a distinct style. Over the course of weeks, we put together a list of four guidepost personality words, but we included a few detail descriptors to clarify what we mean when we say that Figma is bold, for example.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurious\u003c/strong\u003e — Clever, playful, imaginative.

We don’t live in the shoulds, we do what is right and true to us.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe needed a brand that could flex between being reserved and also playful. One that can go from consumers to enterprise, and we felt the words above got us there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"shapes-that-show-off-the-process\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#shapes-that-show-off-the-process\"\u003eShapes that show off the process\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome people might think we just made a bunch of fun new shapes, but there’s a clear methodology behind how they interact or collaborate with each other. We like to think about the shapes as people. People talking, working together, sometimes arguing, or just existing. The illustrations show that collaboration. Depending on how you position them, lots of harmonious compositions can be created. Of course, just like people, some shapes work well with others, while others do not. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are different levels of illustration using the shapes depending on what the moment calls for. If it’s a place where someone is learning and needs absolute clarity, there are no abstract shapes. We include only the illustrations that are simple and straight-forward. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe want design to be more accessible to people, so a lot of our shapes are very simple. They might come together to form something complicated, but they distill down into basic shapes. In the illustrations, we sometimes show that process — how the shape is built. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8564c617572ea295263a6ef5a8d442eee83c980b-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=469\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8564c617572ea295263a6ef5a8d442eee83c980b-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8564c617572ea295263a6ef5a8d442eee83c980b-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8564c617572ea295263a6ef5a8d442eee83c980b-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8564c617572ea295263a6ef5a8d442eee83c980b-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1000w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also wanted the illustrations to feel like they’re still in process. In design, there can be a tendency to share only when it’s complete and perfect. But we wanted to highlight the work that goes into making — it’s often messy, imperfect, changing all the time just like people are. We felt that this realness, this aliveness helped dial up Figma’s vibrancy. You’ll see in the illustrations that at least one element is being manipulated or edited. Nothing feels quite like it’s perfect or complete. We wanted to encourage people to highlight their mess and share how they create. Maybe that way, someone else can learn from your process. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-typography-with-a-few-quirks\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-typography-with-a-few-quirks\"\u003eA typography with a few quirks\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the search for a new brand typeface, a designer on our team came across one called Whyte from Swiss foundry \u003ca href=\"https://www.abcdinamo.com/front\"\u003eDinamo\u003c/a\u003e. At first glance, Whyte looks pretty normal, and then you look closer and you start to notice some oddities. Whyte actually comes in two different versions—standard and inktrap. We fell in love with the inktrap version because it references ink traps in design history. Historically, when people were using metal plates to manually print, ink traps were cut in to create a place for the ink to pool. At smaller sizes, it’s difficult to see, but when you blow the letters up, you can clearly see the notches. We loved it because that characteristic adds an illustrative element to the type itself and we actually wanted to highlight this part of the type’s design that is usually invisible. Whyte spoke to what we wanted to achieve — a seamless flex between nonconforming and reserved. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40748b8a27d4f6377c7efffe9c66f6f64fe4153c-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=469\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40748b8a27d4f6377c7efffe9c66f6f64fe4153c-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40748b8a27d4f6377c7efffe9c66f6f64fe4153c-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40748b8a27d4f6377c7efffe9c66f6f64fe4153c-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40748b8a27d4f6377c7efffe9c66f6f64fe4153c-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1000w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"using-figma-to-refresh-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#using-figma-to-refresh-figma\"\u003eUsing Figma to refresh Figma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe worked exclusively in Figma for the refresh, which was a stretch to our creative muscles since we grew up doing this type of work in Photoshop and Illustrator. We had to come up with new ways to do things. But because we were already thinking creatively, it led us to some celebratory moments where we took an idea even further because of something Figma allowed us to do. Collaboration was a huge part of that. This wasn’t a project where we could or should divide and conquer. We needed to work together, and often, that meant simultaneously. That’s something we could only do in Figma. Whether it was through the process itself, or the illustrations we were creating, we wanted to find ways to demonstrate Figma’s power.

However, Figma is also incredibly useful for user experience research. In fact, the first project I ever completed in Figma was a customer journey map. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy company, \u003ca href=\"https://www.lextech.com\"\u003eLextech\u003c/a\u003e is based in Chicago, Ill., and has a distributed worldwide workforce of talented technology leaders, engineers, and experience designers. Nearly all of our designers are cross-functional, so they’re comfortable doing research and design. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA lot of our focus is spent on improving Fortune 500 customer and employee experiences by analyzing critical workflows in life sciences, aviation, and finance. How do pilots prepare for a flight? How do patients interact with health care professionals? How can financial service representatives better engage customers at a bank?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn many cases, the best way to understand a workflow and collaborate on finding solutions is to create a journey map. The years our design team has spent researching, interviewing, and building those maps taught us a lot about building great customer journey maps – and also how to leverage Figma’s features to deliver it effectively to others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA single customer journey map isn’t always the best way to explain a process. If a process is not linear or has many branches or dependencies, you might choose a more traditional two-dimensional user flow diagram. Or if the process is already well documented via other visual means, a customer journey map might not be as valuable. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"why-map\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#why-map\"\u003eWhy map?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen researched correctly and designed elegantly, customer journey maps are incredibly helpful in creating a shared understanding of a customer process, such as shopping for a car or buying a product from a web site. The customer journey map serves as a visual storytelling aid that clearly explains each step in that process, and often, a level of emotion or pain that the customer faces during each step.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?rect=0,0,1280,779\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=408\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1280w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eExample of how to capture in a customer journey map\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy looking at the same map, people with different viewpoints can easily digest the research that went into building it, and identify places where that process can be improved.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"how-figma-makes-it-easy-to-build-journey-maps\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how-figma-makes-it-easy-to-build-journey-maps\"\u003eHow Figma makes it easy to build journey maps\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve created numerous journey maps in Figma over the past two years, and in that time, we’ve learned a lot about how Figma can improve both our research and design processes. Here’s how our user experience researchers and visual designers have used Figma’s unique features to turn ordinary customer journey maps into extraordinary ones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"a-journey-map-component-library\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-journey-map-component-library\"\u003eA journey map component library\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy creating your own team library of journey map components and styles, you can bring a level of consistency to your design and make it easy to build out new maps quickly. When style changes need to be made, it’s as simple as updating a component. We’ve created a \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/file/TIgdMsi93xMZzSH9ynF5pY/CX-Journey-Map-Template-For-Public/duplicate\"\u003eFigma sample file and component library\u003c/a\u003e that includes some components you might want to consider for your journey maps.

This approach keeps all our interviews and notes in one central location, rather than in multiple tools.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"version-history\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#version-history\"\u003eVersion history\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we deliver a version of our journey map for client review, we manually timestamp a version in our history file, just in case we need to refer to it later on in the project. Sometimes, it’s helpful to show a client how the map evolved over time as we learned more about the customer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe make it a habit to share rough versions of our customer journey maps with actual customers. That allows us to see if they agree with our research findings and whether there are any crucial steps we may have overlooked. The \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/44-comments\"\u003ecomment tool\u003c/a\u003e is a great way to request and collect that feedback to ensure a single source of truth.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, we recently shared a journey map with a user group that frequently travels by air, to ask them how their personal experiences differed from the journey we documented. Their feedback helped us uncover new areas to explore and where we could guide future research activities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur practice at Lextech is to duplicate the Figma file and then share the map as a single-screen prototype, then invite one or more users into the file and add comments asynchronously. One benefit of this approach is that we are able to respond in Figma to ask follow-up questions in the comment thread.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther times, when reviewing the map on a conference call or in person, we’ll have a designer type in feedback from all participants via direct comments into the file. In both cases, the exact placement of these comments ensures that when they’re reviewed later, we’ll know exactly where in the journey that feedback was given.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn some cases, we’ll create multiple copies of the same Figma file, so that feedback isn’t “poisoned” by previous comments. This ensures that each set of new eyes sees an unbiased view of the journey map, plus, it also helps us organize feedback by source. For instance, it’s sometimes helpful to see whether journey map feedback from customers matches that from the client, to see what differences may exist.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"make-your-journey-map-interactive\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#make-your-journey-map-interactive\"\u003eMake your journey map interactive\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven if you only plan to share your customer journey map as a printed document, consider adding navigational hotspots. In our sample file, we not only created a printed version with all the phases combined, but also one with a main navigation menu and links to each phase. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring one project, we had so many great customer quotes that we couldn’t fit them all in the print version of the map. In the digital version, we offered viewers a way to tap the map to read those extra quotes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the sample interactive journey map, if you tap on one of the happy or sad faces, you’ll get a popover that explains the grading scale a bit more. This helps reduce the amount of data you actually need to place on the screen, to make the key content more obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, the best customer journey maps are not created once and forgotten, but are continually reviewed and revised – just like a digital product. As your experience research teams learn more about customers, you might find yourself adding new steps into the journey, or revising existing ones to be more accurate. Thinking of your journey map as an iterative learning tool is the best way to stay continuously connected to your customers.

They’ve been on our customers’ minds for even longer. If you’re a fellow designer or someone who works closely with design teams, you’re probably all too familiar with the challenges of designing for a highly requested customer feature, one where users may have pre-existing expectations for how it might work. \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-smart-animate-and-advanced-transitions/#find-the-figma-way-or-your-way\"\u003eClick ahead\u003c/a\u003e to dig into the features and see real examples of Smart Animate in action. Or continue reading to see how we designed Smart Animate… \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we kicked off design discovery for our first release of Smart Animate, we began to look for answers starting from a familiar place—our users. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"understand-users-who-are-experiencing-pain\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#understand-users-who-are-experiencing-pain\"\u003eUnderstand users who are experiencing pain\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen working on a hard design problem, talking to users is always a great start and you don’t have to be a big company to set up systematic ways to do qualitative user research. One of the ways we continuously gather feedback is through in-product NPS surveys. (Surprise! We do read the comments and take action.) Our support team replies to many responses directly, but we also categorize the NPS comments into meaningful groupings. This makes it easy to keep a pulse on specific topics and can serve as a starting point for user feedback when we’re ready to kickstart design for a new feature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are some things we heard about prototyping in Figma...\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeaking of animations, I would love simple things like dropdown lists, buttons hovers, varied and smooth appearance of pop-ups, switching tabs, and so on. It is not about complex animation…\u0026#34;  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;When I am designing screens where animation plays a big part in the experience, we need other tools to show what we want from our developers. E.g. a click shows an advanced transition from one screen to another. I would like to not use another tool for my creations.\u0026#34;  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;I was wondering if you plan to add more prototype transitions?

For us, it’s in having an open feedback channel where we can hear from customers who are experiencing “pain”. We’re able to talk to them directly to get ideas on what features they’re looking for and understand what they like and don’t like about how they animate prototypes today inside and outside of Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFun fact: Many of these NPS survey respondents became our first beta customers. Special shoutout and thank you to all of them!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"zoom-out-to-uncover-patterns-across-use-cases\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#zoom-out-to-uncover-patterns-across-use-cases\"\u003eZoom out to uncover patterns across use cases\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause a feature like Smart Animate needs to support a variety of use cases, we can’t just design Smart Animate with one specific use case in mind. Otherwise, it’ll be too limiting and not useful for the majority of our users. To make sure that what we design can scale for a multitude of use cases, we had to zoom out and search for common design patterns. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe gathered all the animation examples we could find through our conversations with customers. We also did our own research into interactive interfaces we use in our daily lives. Then we explored how someone would prototype this in Figma and what challenges they would face when doing so. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis process led us to two major patterns that you’ll see in today’s first release of Smart Animate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePattern #1: An object appears, disappears, or changes while the user stays on the same screen\u003c/strong\u003eYou probably see this pattern everyday, like when you hover over a video and the playbar appears, when you hover over a navigation item and a dropdown expands, or when you swipe an object away and new content emerges from underneath.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePattern #2: Several UI elements stay fixed while the majority of the content on the user’s screen changes\u003c/strong\u003eYou’ll find this common pattern in a tabbed navigation. This slightly more complex animation appears when you drag content left or right and the tab bar indicator moves in the opposite direction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUpleveling beyond individual use cases allowed us to focus on common denominators. Pinning down these two patterns helped us keep the feature scope focused while still addressing many of our customers’ use cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"find-the-figma-way-or-your-way\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#find-the-figma-way-or-your-way\"\u003eFind the Figma way (or your way)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re not the only ones trying to solve these design challenges for our customers. However, we wanted our implementation of the solution to ‘feel’ like Figma. That meant making sure Smart Animate and Drag felt well-integrated with existing prototyping features. Sometimes, building new features requires a re-examination of what’s currently there. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst at the most fundamental level, we wanted the auto-animation of layers to work out-of-the-box as best as possible. So we revisited the basics, like layer naming. We didn’t want to completely reinvent the wheel, but this seemingly small update took countless hours to get right. I’ll spare you all the details, but essentially we updated how we automatically name and rename objects on creation or duplication, so layers that match up based on hierarchy, naming, and order will auto-animate. Additionally, in cases where something wouldn’t work, we wanted to make debugging of that situation a lot easier! That’s why you’ll get visual feedback on hover and selection to quickly check if layers match up correctly. Now when you hover over the layer you’re trying to animate, you’ll see every matching counterpart on other frames.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other thing we wanted to make sure we got right is enabling users to combine the new Smart Animate transition with existing transitions. For transitions you already use today like Push, Move, or Slide, you’ll now see an additional setting called “Smart Animate Matching Layers”. This automatically detects matching layers between two screens and animates them separately from the other objects. This little checkbox enables you to build more complex animations, faster, while minimizing the number of duplicative layers you previously needed to create to express such an animation. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor us, designing new features also means making sure the new additions work seamlessly alongside existing features and doesn’t add unnecessary product complexity. It’s not just about building more new stuff; it’s also about making sure the stuff that’s already there still works great and continues to support new capabilities. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"prototype-examples-to-help-you-get-started\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#prototype-examples-to-help-you-get-started\"\u003ePrototype examples to help you get started\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow to help inspire ideas and give you a few real examples, our team got together to create a bunch of new animated prototypes you can view and duplicate.

As those of you who read our \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/\"\u003eengineering blog post\u003c/a\u003e know, we did a lot of research to figure out how to safely run 3rd-party code on figma.com. We eventually settled on a technology called the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/agoric/realms-shim/\"\u003eRealms shim\u003c/a\u003e to do this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA little over two weeks ago, several independent vulnerabilities were recently discovered with the Realms shim that could have allowed code inside the sandbox to escape. We promptly fixed the vulnerabilities, and after auditing all published Figma plugins we have no evidence that the vulnerabilities were ever exploited by a Figma plugin. We then went further and made a fundamental change to our technology stack to help prevent this type of vulnerability from happening again in the future. Please read the remainder of this post for more details.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"background\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#background\"\u003eBackground\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore we talk about the vulnerabilities, it’s useful to have background on the security principles of Figma plugins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma seeks to ensure that plugins \u003cstrong\u003ecan\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eOnly be run by an explicit user action\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShow UI in a single plugin-specific dialog\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRead any data in your Figma document (e.g. a “find layer by name” plugin)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eModify any data in your Figma document (e.g. a “rename selected layers” plugin)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCommunicate with any server over the internet (e.g. an “import from service X” plugin)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma seeks to ensure that plugins \u003cstrong\u003ecan’t\u003c/strong\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRun by themselves\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGet information about the project or team that owns the file\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess anything when they aren’t running\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess data from any files other than the file they were run in\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eChange Figma’s UI outside of the plugin UI dialog\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma\u0026#39;s \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/organization/\"\u003eOrganization tier\u003c/a\u003e has an additional security feature: administrators can configure a whitelist of plugins that are allowed inside the organization. This can be used to prevent untrusted plugins from being run in any file in that organization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"figma-s-response\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#figma-s-response\"\u003eFigma’s response\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were two rounds of vulnerability disclosures, one published as a public GitHub issue and the rest published as a private GitHub security advisory. Please refer to \u003ca href=\"https://agoric.com/realms-shim-security-updates/\"\u003ethis blog post\u003c/a\u003e. Had these vulnerabilities been exploited, the restrictions that Figma puts on plugins (described above) could have been bypassed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgoric, the team that makes the Realms shim, promptly notified us once the first vulnerability was disclosed and worked closely with us and with other companies that use the Realms shim to make sure the fixes were rolled out responsibly to minimize risk. All fixes have now finished rolling out and all details about the vulnerabilities have now been made public.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo ensure the security of our users, the main actions we took were to:  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDisable publishing of new plugin code until the incident was fully resolved\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eApply the patch to the known public vulnerability as soon as possible\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCoordinate with Agoric and other affected parties about a public disclosure timeline\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake a technology change (described in the next section) that avoided the privately-disclosed vulnerabilities\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, we prevented new plugins from being published to the community hub. We can do that by simply halting plugin reviews, since all new Figma plugins have to be manually reviewed and approved by us before they appear in the community hub for people to install. It\u0026#39;s worth noting that our manual review process is about plugin user experience. We do not rely on human reviews to audit newly-published plugins for security as audits can produce false negatives. We instead use a sandbox to enforce a security boundary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also completely disabled publishing updates to existing plugins. This ensures that if a plugin developer with existing plugins was aware of a vulnerability, they could not exploit it. This was especially important as plugin code in Figma is live, which means updates to existing plugins instantly propagate to all open clients.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first vulnerability was published as a public GitHub issue, and therefore needed to be patched immediately. Fortunately, Agoric moved fast and had a fix on the same day. We applied the fix to Figma’s copy of the Realms shim and it went out with the next deploy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe remaining vulnerabilities were disclosed in a private GitHub security advisory that only a few affected parties had access to. We were able to deploy a solution to those the following week. However, we waited before talking about the vulnerability publicly. With security advisories, the standard practice is to set a public disclosure date that gives enough time for affected parties to apply the patch while also acting as a deadline to make sure the vulnerability is patched promptly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs such, we worked with Agoric to ensure that these issues remained private until after we had fully rolled out our fixes. We also did an audit of published plugin code and discovered no evidence that these vulnerabilities had ever been exploited by a Figma plugin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-technology-change\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-technology-change\"\u003eA technology change\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe biggest change we made while responding to this incident was to change the way we run JavaScript code in plugins. We no longer use the Realms shim at all. We now use \u003ca href=\"https://bellard.org/quickjs/\"\u003eQuickJS\u003c/a\u003e, a JavaScript VM written in C and cross-compiled to WebAssembly. This was our backup plan in case the Realms shim approach didn\u0026#39;t work out. We were able to activate our backup plan very quickly thanks to a swappable architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll vulnerabilities that were discovered with the Realms shim during this incident are no longer possible with our new implementation. This specific class of issues involve the Realms shim confusing an object from outside the sandbox with an object from inside the sandbox or vice versa. This is possible because the Realms shim uses the same JavaScript VM for all code both inside and outside the sandbox. Now that we\u0026#39;re using a JavaScript VM compiled to WebAssembly, it\u0026#39;s not possible to confuse objects from outside with objects from inside because the object representations are too different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy did we originally pick the Realms shim for Figma plugins? The Realms shim provides great performance and makes debugging Figma plugins really easy with minimal work on Figma\u0026#39;s part. Code running inside the Realms shim still uses the browser\u0026#39;s JavaScript VM so it runs just as fast as normal JavaScript. And the browser\u0026#39;s built-in debugger can debug plugins in the Realms shim with the same rich development experience that all web developers are used to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhy have we decided to keep using our backup plan, even though all vulnerabilities in the Realms shim have been fixed? We\u0026#39;re actually very happy with the fact that we can switch back and forth between a Realms-based security model and a VM-based security model, but it comes at a cost. It is disruptive to us, and more importantly, disruptive to our developers. For now, it feels like the right call is to stick with the VM-based approach, which is somewhat slower for certain plugins, but intrinsically more secure. As Realms matures and evolves, we will always be able to switch back when the time is right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-timeline\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-timeline\"\u003eThe timeline\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSaturday, Sept 14th:    - The first vulnerability was disclosed on a GitHub issue    - Figma stopped approving new plugins \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMonday, Sept 16th:    - Figma began working on the new WebAssembly JavaScript runtime    - A GitHub security advisory thread containing the remaining    vulnerabilities was started    \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTuesday, Sept 17th:    - Figma deployed the patch for the first vulnerability  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWednesday, Sept 18th:    - Figma disabled publishing updates to existing plugins  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWednesday, Sept 25th:    - Figma shipped the new WebAssembly JavaScript runtime    - Figma re-enabled plugin publishing    - Figma did an audit of published plugin code and discovered no evidence that these vulnerabilities had been exploited by a Figma plugin  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWednesday, October 2nd:    - Agoric made all vulnerabilities public    - This post was published\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

When I first started the daily pattern challenge, I was drawing my patterns by hand but switched to digital when I became interested in composing patterns using basic geometric shapes. By the end of my pattern designing process, some of the patterns look quite complicated, but they started out as simple shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles that I strategically placed on my grid. Though I start with the basics, I play around with the shapes to see how different approaches yield different visual results. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, I might make a circle and then rotate it by 45 degrees to see how that feels. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?rect=0,0,1199,537\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=300\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1199w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOr maybe I’ll get a little more adventurous and play with rotating each semi-circle by a different angle.

But if you’d prefer a deeper introduction to the world of OpenType, read on for the tale of one designer’s love affair with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-mysterious-double-life-of-warnock-pro\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-mysterious-double-life-of-warnock-pro\"\u003eThe mysterious double life of Warnock Pro\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI remember exactly when and where I was when I discovered fonts have secrets. It happened many years ago, during one beautiful Amsterdam spring, in a small room at the Vrije Universiteit. I was working on my doctoral thesis, but things weren’t going very well. So, I did what I often do when the creative side of my brain becomes restless: I turned to typography.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI explored the university’s directory of fonts, and dove into the PDF instruction manual of Warnock Pro, one of my favorites. I’d used it before and thought I knew it well, but that day I learned it had been living a mysterious double life. The PDF explained Warnock Pro was more than it appeared: True connoisseurs of the font could move past its basic look and customize the \u003cem\u003echaracter\u003c/em\u003e of its characters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe options went beyond — far beyond — the standard bold and italic. The first thing I noticed were new number styles, named “old-style figures” and “tabular figures.” These were digits of different shapes and positions, meant to blend better than Warnock Pro’s default digits when used within text, or inside tables:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to lowercase and uppercase, there was also a different, in-between style called “small caps” — meant “to introduce the first few words at the beginning of a story, or to highlight key words within text”:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI also learned that many of the letters came with hidden alternative versions, which — as the PDF explained — “have an ending flourish and could be used at the end of a word or phrase as a design embellishment”:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was a section called “ordinals,” explaining that Warnock Pro came equipped with beautiful fractions, and what in time would become one of my favorite glyphs ever: \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign\"\u003enumero\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were also “stylistic alternates,” slightly different versions of a few characters:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, right next door, “ornaments,” a way to turn the aforementioned letters into all sorts of gorgeous symbols:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe list seemed endless, and I felt overwhelmed; the typeface I thought I knew had so much more to offer than I’d realized. The swashes, the ornaments, the extra digits — I still didn’t quite understand what many of these were \u003cem\u003efor,\u003c/em\u003e but I wanted to use them anyway. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a little digging, there came another shock: Warnock Pro’s secrets were accessible in some design tools I was already using! The options were bundled under an obscure technical term called “OpenType features,” hidden inside submenus, filled with checkmarks attached to scary-sounding names. It was no wonder I’d never stumbled upon them before. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the weeks to follow I became intoxicated with OpenType. I discovered that a few other fonts also contained these features, and I filled my thesis to the brim with them. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was like a cook discovering the world’s spices for the first time. Why had no one told me about the existence of typographic paprika, coriander, cumin, and thyme? I’d been working with plain old salt and pepper, when Warnock Pro and other fonts had an endless number of more interesting seasonings. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePredictably, I went overboard, applying the spices bluntly and indiscriminately. I added swashes to my chapter titles, peppered in a few different types of digits, and even snuck in an ornament or two. To top it all, I added an extra section to my thesis titled “A note on typography.” Even there, I set the first two words in small caps, and wrote out the year in old-style digits.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut clumsy as it all was, it also felt profound: I wanted to share what I’d learned with the world. This was, as far as I can remember, my first public declaration of love for typography — and OpenType features were what led me there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=369\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-adolescent-years-with-opentype\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-adolescent-years-with-opentype\"\u003eThe adolescent years with OpenType\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the next few years, I made sure to open every PDF that came with a font, and inspect all the OpenType secrets hiding inside.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs time passed, more and more fonts came equipped with special seasoning options. And, in time, online type specimen pages replaced PDFs as the method for communicating them (here’s an example from a font I like a lot, although \u003ca href=\"https://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/cms/fonts/marcin-typewriter?page=3\"\u003eI cannot quite explain why\u003c/a\u003e). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough these specimen pages, I learned that not all fonts were made equal. Some came with just a singular option that changed only one character. Other times, a font would have dozens of OpenType features, each affecting the entire character set. In those cases, enabling the feature meant watching a font transform in front of my eyes, morphing into what felt like an entirely new typeface.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMonths turned into years, and my knowledge of OpenType accumulated. I came to learn the meaning of specific technical terms, like “tabular numbers” (numbers meant to be put in tables) or “discretionary ligatures” (as in: to be used at your discretion). After even more time, I started understanding the meaning of \u003cem\u003efeatures themselves\u003c/em\u003e: rather than enabling them simply because I could, I paid closer attention to what problems they were supposed to solve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne example: Just a few years ago, when I was working at Medium, we spent time figuring out how to choose the right digits for all the articles on the platform. In body text, we tried to make them as unexciting as possible, flowing well with sentences around them. For the rare pull quotes, however, we decided to do the opposite, going for headline-like digits, and a flamboyant ampersand — all hiding inside OpenType features of a font named Kievit:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAround the same time, poster designers I worked with taught me about another important OpenType feature. It turned out many fonts came with a set of slightly adjusted and re-aligned symbols and punctuation, to be used when writing exclusively in all caps, crucial in making everything feel better and more cohesive together:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd even recently at Figma, the \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-new-finger-tips/\"\u003ekeyboard shortcuts panel\u003c/a\u003e I helped build used some OpenType features of Inter, to make it easier for the users to distinguish letterforms that otherwise could look too similar:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver and over again, whether I used typography in service of print, user interfaces, or graphic design, it continued to surprise me how often small differences like these mattered — how often the fonts and typography choices felt \u003cem\u003ealmost\u003c/em\u003e there, but just a letterform or two away from the entire project coming together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOpenType features frequently helped find the right letterforms and save the day. From a distance, many of them appeared trivial and disposable — but just like seasoning, they became something no typographic dish could really live without. Sometimes one feature was as simple as a pinch of salt on watermelon, or nutmeg added to sautéed kale: undetectable as its own flavor, but in combination with the right ingredient, arriving at something enriching, deep, magical. The other times, it was something huge, weird, and suspect that worked surprisingly well — like \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/05/well/eat/farmers-market-shopping-with-the-chef-tom-colicchio.html\"\u003echamomile and fish\u003c/a\u003e, or pepperoni pizza with honey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"introducing-opentype-features-in-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#introducing-opentype-features-in-figma\"\u003eIntroducing OpenType features in Figma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven my history with OpenType features, it’s not surprising that supporting OpenType features was my first Figma project. I proposed the idea even before officially joining, as a guest during one of the company’s Maker Weeks. (Lucky for me, the Figma team also agreed it was important to make OpenType features more accessible to our customers).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt felt important to me. The features held a special place in my heart, found at that treasured intersection of “playfulness” and “usability.” They traveled with me throughout my design career – I used OpenType features when teaching typography workshops at Google, fought for them at Medium, and enabled them in government projects at Code for America. I wanted others to discover and experience them, too – and to make that process as easy and friendly as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, I’m happy to announce Figma will support OpenType features in any font you use. Click on the three dots in the Type section, and you will see a new panel that gives you access to your font’s secrets:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe wanted to remove some of the challenges of going through PDFs and specimen websites, but without dumbing things down.

Done well, they can leverage the unique superpowers of your team members to raise the collective quality of each individual’s work. Critiques should leave you feeling inspired, challenged, and empowered. However, in practice, it doesn’t always pan out that way. A poorly managed critique can cause your team to feel discouraged, overwhelmed, or completely lost. Over the past year, we’ve made a lot of changes to the way we do critiques at Figma to try and avoid those pitfalls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur driving philosophy is the belief that critiques should be motivating, not intimidating. Helpful, not discouraging. They should feel fun and be something designers look forward to. Does your team feel this way? If not, there’s an opportunity to turn them around and make them better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe often forget how much of a privilege it is to truly collaborate with talented peers. Recurring design critiques are an essential part of fostering elevated collaboration between team members. We lose sight of the potential of the meeting if they aren’t run well, or if the environment doesn’t feel safe. Getting them right is a critical part of your team’s design culture and identity, and makes a large impact in recruiting and retaining talent!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this article, I’ll share how we use critiques at Figma, and how we worked together as a team to turn them into meetings we all enjoy, rather than fear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"critiquing-critiques\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#critiquing-critiques\"\u003eCritiquing critiques\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI had been helping facilitate critiques at Figma for about a year when the team decided to get together and chat about what was working and what wasn’t. We set out to “critique critiques”, if you will (🤦‍♂️).

During the meeting, people started proposing one idea after another. The energy was light and fun, yet productive. This was ironically the exact feeling we wanted to replicate during critiques themselves!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat was it about this context that allowed people to loosen up and get creative? Perhaps the stakes were lower? Or no one person felt they personally were getting critiqued? Whatever it was, we were clearly working well together, and it felt great. By identifying the positive flow of the room as it was working, and acknowledging it, we knew our target.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecognizing we wouldn’t solve everything in one discussion and that this would be an ongoing process, we created a “#design-crit-crit” channel in Slack to keep iterating together. Especially as our team grows, and as the types of problems we work on change, we wanted to make sure our process is always evolving with the company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?rect=1,0,2027,1295\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=428\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eOngoing suggestions in the #design-crit-crit channel\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"goals\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#goals\"\u003eGoals\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs in any good design process, we first had to align on the goals of critique.

Critiques need to remain a safe space for exploration and feedback, independent from roadmap decision making and free from stress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, critiques exist to help the designer/presenter — the person looking for support. In that way, it’s really up to them to utilize the best approach to accomplish that.

They are designed to take place either in a 1-hour meeting (usually 2 topics, 20-30 minutes each) or in smaller ad hoc meetings, depending on the method. With the exception of the “Paper Print-Out,” any of these should work great for remote teams as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?rect=1,0,2170,1496\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=462\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_1-standard\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_1-standard\"\u003e1.

Why is it important? What are the goals? The project goals are the foundation of the project, and if people miss that part, their feedback will be misdirected. Decide if you want people to interrupt with questions, or wait until you’re done sharing, and let them know which you prefer. Include a slide dedicated to “Here’s the feedback I am looking for,” and conversely, “Here’s what I’m NOT looking for” to keep the discussion focused. Remind them to write down their thoughts as you’re going through the content. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRather than present on a big screen, we often send everyone a Figma link and have them jump into \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-feature-highlight-observation-mode/\"\u003eObservation Mode\u003c/a\u003e. We find it much easier to see details this way, it works great for remote participants, is more reliable connectivity-wise, and better for high frame-rates than most screen-sharing software. You run the small risk of people wandering in the file rather than observing, but we’ve found that can also sometimes be a good thing if someone missed something but didn’t want to stop the full group for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStep 2: Clarifying questions (~2-5m)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter you finish presenting, take a few minutes to allow anyone to jump in with clarifying questions. This is important because if one person is confused, it is likely others are as well.

We’ve branded them to make them easier for the facilitator/presenter to request which form they prefer to receive feedback in:  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRound-The-Room (RTR 🎡) — Go one at a time around the room, and give everyone a chance to voice their feedback. Try to keep it to two minutes per person. No “interruptions” from others — if they have a pressing thought, encourage them to write it down for their turn. It’s important to go one at a time and give space for the person speaking to help folks who may not normally feel comfortable speaking up in groups. Having a structured format to receive feedback like this enables us to be more inclusive of different people and preferences. Allow people to “pass” if they have nothing to add, or if they’d like to think more and provide feedback later.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePopcorn (🍿) — Freeform discussion. It’s called Popcorn because comments pop up from all over the place unpredictably. This is more improvisational and helpful for flowing conversation where people can jump in with \u003ca href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/3042080/yes-and-5-more-lessons-in-improv-ing-collaboration-and-creativity-from-second-city\"\u003e“Yes, and...”\u003c/a\u003e We often use Popcorn if we’re short on time and preface it with, “Any one have any critical things you feel the need to share?” Then we’ll document any other comments later. However, please note that this method can be dangerous for inclusion as it can reward the “loudest voice.” To combat this, I’d encourage the group to call on people who haven’t spoken (if they’re comfortable with that), or moderate the conversation a bit if it’s getting lopsided.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you’re receiving feedback, try not to get defensive and justify everything. It’s best to model good behavior by simply thanking people for their feedback. You don’t need to respond immediately to everyone’s points. It’s ok to take time to consider what they’re after and get back to them later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t forget to thank everyone, and let people know how best to send you feedback if they think of anything else. Should they send it via Slack? In a notes document somewhere? In the Figma file? Are you free to meet with them individually? If so, when? You could also put the work on them to find time with you, which can filter out people who felt strongly enough to do that.

Maybe you’re looking to soak in as much as you can from other people about what they may have already thought about or explored in the past. Maybe you just want a kick-start to be as divergent and exploratory as possible before starting to narrow in. Your design team brings together so many different perspectives and skills that involving them early can often inspire entirely new concepts, and help avoid tunnel-vision. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow:\u003c/strong\u003e There are lots of methods out there for brainstorming.

Our favorite way of doing these, however, is inside of Figma itself. In particular, one recent fun example was when one of our design interns, \u003ca href=\"https://andrewshen.net/\"\u003eAndrew Shen\u003c/a\u003e, got a bunch of us in a room to research his summer project, “Comments in Figma.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll Andrew had to do was drop us a Figma file with a few prompting questions for us to jam on. Things like, “What are the biggest problems with comments today?” “What commenting experiences do we like?” “Any ideas on how they should behave?” “Should they be more like email or like Slack?” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen we were off to the races — we went heads down for 30 minutes and started dropping in references, snippets of texts, and anything else we could to get our ideas across. This quickly became much deeper than just a survey or a poll because you could see others’ ideas in real-time, and start to riff off of them together. After going heads down, we went around the room and discussed each other’s ideas, adding any clarification where needed. In just a single hour, Andrew had leveraged the collective brainpower of six people, and had tons of material to work from when starting to sketch out some ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=360\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1210w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eAndrew’s Figma file for us didn’t require much prep or even facilitation — just a few empty frames with questions in them and we were off to the races.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_3-pair-design\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_3-pair-design\"\u003e3.

So much so that for a little while, once a week we dedicated one of the critiques to strictly using this method. We’d start each meeting by dividing people up into groups of no more than three people to tackle problems. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve since moved away from requiring this once a week because it didn’t feel right to force people to use a method if they weren’t ready for it. Instead, we’ve started encouraging people to plan these meetings ad hoc. Now, people simply shout out in the design channel on Slack, “Hey, anyone free to pair?” — then they schedule a separate time together. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother way to encourage frequent pair designing is by assigning a “co-pilot” to any lead designer working a project. At a start up like Figma, we’re a small team so there aren’t enough designers to have multiple people on the same problem full-time. We found that by assigning a partner even just part-time, it can make a big difference in feeling less alone while solving a problem. It hasn’t been perfect or consistent; for many projects we forget to assign a co-pilot or people simply get too busy.

But bear with us. We first got the idea to try this after Niko, one of our designers, read the \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-silent-meeting-manifesto-v1-189e9e3487eb\"\u003eSilent Meetings Manifesto\u003c/a\u003e. In it, the author, David Gasca, laments his frustrations for typical corporate meetings, and offers a unique alternative:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#39;Silent Meetings\u0026#39; are meetings where most of the time is spent thinking and discussing [via writing] the topics at hand. Functionally, they are based around a \u0026#39;Table Read\u0026#39; that everyone at the meeting reads silently, comments in and then discusses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe basic idea is that verbal communication in a group setting only allows for one line of conversation at a time. You have a speaker, and a bunch of listeners. By not relying on speaking, a “Silent Meeting” can instead offer multiple conversation threads simultaneously, allowing for a greater volume of feedback to be received in a shorter period of time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the givers, it allows the inclusive opportunity to more deeply internalize the work, and write thoughtful responses by being able to move at their own pace. For the receiver, it can be exhilarating and exhausting, but also very rewarding. Niko, for example, works remotely from Germany and often finds himself needing half a day to process the avalanche of feedback. And although it can feel overwhelming at first, it can spark so many new ideas over time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSilent critiques do require more preparation work as they effectively need to work asynchronously; the audience needs to be able to gather all the context necessary inside the document to offer feedback. Another reason this works particularly well for remote designers, is that they often have time and interest for exercises that get the most out of their limited interactions with headquarters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese Silent critiques can also be done completely asynchronously by sending out a prompt in a Slack channel. But we found that the main advantage of scheduling a set time or doing in person is to ensure people actually take the time to review the work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eTimelapse of a recent Silent critique we ran at Figma\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_5-paper-print-out-critiques\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_5-paper-print-out-critiques\"\u003e5.

Crazy, right? Sometimes I think we forget how valuable it was then to get the chance to work with physical materials. We’re so used to staring at screens all day that we assume meetings have to run this way too. Actually encouraging people to get up and move around has a ton of benefits. Ideas may flow more freely, and the change in context can be helpful for not feeling so limited by pixels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you went to design school like I did, you might have had the profoundly memorable experience where professors would hang up all of the students work on foam core or cork walls and teach everyone how to critique it together. Sometimes they’d take a big red pen and annotate all over it. The class would surround the work, one at a time, and talk through what was working and what wasn’t. In my nearly 10 years designing products since then, I can only remember a small handful of times the design teams I worked on tried this method. Instead, we most often pointed at a screen on one side of the room, some of the time sitting nearly 20 feet (~6 meters) away from it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJenny, Rasmus, and Marcin, three of our product designers at Figma, have been particularly big proponents of getting us out of our chairs and back to the basics. The meeting can be run the same way as a “standard critique,” except we’re all gathering around the print outs, and attaching sticky notes as feedback. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven that this method doesn’t work well for remote attendees, we combat this by assigning a note taker, recording the meeting, and taking photos. If the attendee can join in real-time, we\u0026#39;ll often have a complementary Figma file (which doesn’t take much extra effort to make since you already needed to make one for printing), which lets them have their own “digital wall” if they’d like to try and follow along and add comments that way. If you really wanted to, you could even have the note taker try and transcribe their digital notes into physical ones to keep them together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe end up doing this no more than once a month simply because of the overhead, and the reality of needing to put this feedback back in digitally. But once in a while, it’s a real treat to change up our day-to-day and goes a long way in opening up the conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBonus:\u003c/strong\u003e A great side-effect of this is method is that it doubles as an amazing and lightweight way to share context or spark discussions with people from other functions in the office. If you’re able to, consider leaving the work up in the room even after the meeting, or even better if it’s on foam core that you can move it out to a more visible space in the office. The next time you see someone standing there, talk to them and ask them what they’re thinking! This fosters random cross-contamination, increases the context, and can increase the chance of serendipitous moments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_6-fyi\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_6-fyi\"\u003e6.

      "content_html": "\u003cdiv id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince the introduction of its Fluent design system, Microsoft has been on a mission to improve usability, consistency, and accessibility across all their products. But driving adoption across multiple product lines, organizations, and teams comes with its fair share of complexities. Tooling is more important than ever. As Eugene Gavriloff, Design Tools Team Lead, explains, “We’re constantly thinking about how to create better design tools and services that help people make great products.” And that is where Figma plugins come into play. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlugins can serve as little power-ups to a designer’s process. For large teams, they can bring more efficiency to your workflow and help eliminate tedious tasks. But sometimes, you may need a private plugin tailored specifically to your team\u0026#39;s needs, like bringing in relevant data, importing translations, or automating tedious work.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Microsoft, the opportunity to customize their processes with Figma Plugins meant they could more seamlessly integrate the Fluent design system into their workflow and help designers be more efficient. As \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-plugins-jackie-chui-microsoft/\"\u003eJackie Chui\u003c/a\u003e, UX designer, puts it, “The more tools we integrate into our Fluent design system, the more useful our system becomes.” Let’s see what they’ve built…\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"bring-custom-design-assets-into-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#bring-custom-design-assets-into-figma\"\u003eBring custom design assets into Figma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery designer knows that dummy content can fail to capture design intent; lorem ipsum doesn\u0026#39;t always cut it. And at Microsoft dropping in generic content can lead to issues, even if used in a mock or prototype. So Eugene created a custom plugin called \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/731627216655469013/Content-Reel/\"\u003eContent Reel\u003c/a\u003e which helps Microsoft designers find specific content for their layouts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile this plugin is available to the community, Microsoft has an internal version just for their teams. For example, Microsoft’s version of Content Reel pulls in approved text strings, avatars, and icons into their designs. Not only does this make the designer’s life easier, but it also removes the process of finding or seeking approval on specific content. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInterested in building your own Content Reel plugin? We imagine every company can have its own version of Content Reel that pulls in custom content, approved by their organization. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"switch-between-your-own-libraries-easily\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#switch-between-your-own-libraries-easily\"\u003eSwitch between your own libraries easily\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor companies with multiple products, it’s a common practice to have unique libraries and styles for each product. At Microsoft, they have hundreds of libraries in Figma. At this scale, adapting designs to multiple product styles can be a manual, thankless process. Thus Jackie set out to solve this challenge. He created Themer, which allows Microsoft designers to quickly switch between their multiple product themes like Work, Outlook, and others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re looking to create your own version of Themer, first check out the publicly available \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/731176732337510831/Themer/\"\u003eThemer plugin\u003c/a\u003e built by our very own Design Advocate, Tom Lowry.  Tom’s Themer plugin allows you to easily swap between published styles from your libraries.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEver mindful of their workflows, designers recognized how much time they spent on repetitive tasks. To free up time for creative problem solving, the Microsoft team also built a suite of plugins to help each other – and any design team – trade the daily grind for an efficient state of zen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Jackie, his passion for plugins preceded plugins themselves. A natural tinkerer, he’s been exploring the Figma API ever since the launch of \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-platform/\"\u003eFigma platform\u003c/a\u003e more than a year ago and loves building tools that empower designers to focus on what they do best—creating beautiful experiences. “Figma has become the primary design tool in Microsoft,” Jackie says, “so it only makes sense for me to start building on the platform that helps my team\u0026#39;s workflow and expand outward from there.” Here are a few of Jackie’s plugins available to the Figma community:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/735072959812183643/Find-and-Replace/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFind and Replace does\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e just what it says; it searches for texts on your page and replaces them just like a text editor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/740097744539225981/Paste-to-Fill/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePaste to Fill\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e enables you to copy an image and paste it as a fill on your selected layers.

She sits on the Modern Input and Accessibility team where she is focused on creating more awareness around making product experiences more inclusive. She is on a mission to reverse how designers approach accessibility at Microsoft. She explains, “We tend to think of accessibility as an afterthought—something that gets tacked on at the end of the product development process, but that results in a lot of serious implications.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTiffany has built a handful of accessibility tools that empower her fellow designers to bring designing accessibility to the forefront. Her vision is to build an entire suite of accessibility plugins and make them available to the public. Here are the first of Tiffany’s accessibility plugins:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/731310036968334777/Focus-Orderer/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFocus Orderer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e automates a lot of the (very manual) design process for annotating for accessibility purposes.

It’s top of mind in how we work, treat customer data, and develop our product. Here are a few recent security improvements we’ve made to Figma: \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"we-got-soc-2-type-1-certified\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#we-got-soc-2-type-1-certified\"\u003eWe got SOC 2 Type 1 certified\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re pleased to announce that we’ve successfully completed our SOC 2 Type 1 certification!

Security was the top priority, perhaps even at the expense of additional platform capabilities. For example, we made sure Figma Plugins could only access a single design file and never a user’s entire account; one plugin also cannot access another plugin’s data. The team also made the decision to not allow a Figma Plugin to change the Figma UI, leading to potential user misdirection (and making the user vulnerable to phishing attacks). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithout spoiling more of \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/\"\u003eRudi’s post\u003c/a\u003e, I highly encourage you to dive in and read about what our team learned and the technical risks we took in our development journey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"saml-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#saml-figma\"\u003eSAML + Figma = 👍\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, we know your organization requires a certain level of enterprise security.

In Figma, name your layers with a # followed by the column header from the sheet (ex: #Name, #Address, #Country). Then launch the plugin, enter your shareable URL, and hit the \u0026#34;Fetch \u0026amp; sync\u0026#34; button. And voila—your entire design is populated in seconds. Google Sheets Sync is also really handy because you can still manage your data with all of the benefits and features of a spreadsheet; making it a breeze to leverage formulas or make updates down the road. As an added bonus, you can also include a URL with images in your columns; so if you want to populate a shape with an image fill, just name the layer the same as you would for a text layer and the plugin will take care of the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"unsplash\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#unsplash\"\u003eUnsplash\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreator: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/LiamMartens9512\"\u003eLiam Martens\u003c/a\u003e, in collaboration with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/kirillz\"\u003eKirill Zakharov\u003c/a\u003e at \u003ca href=\"https://unsplash.com/\"\u003eUnsplash\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s hard to think of a better place to find beautiful photography on the web—\u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/738454987945972471/\"\u003eUnsplash\u003c/a\u003e has over a million high resolution images (free for personal and commercial use) from some of the world’s most generous photographers. Need some amazing imagery for your project? Simply launch the plugin then choose from a predefined category, a randomly selected image, or search the collection for that perfect image. By default, the plugin will insert a high resolution photo onto the canvas. You can also insert photos as image fills by pre-selecting all of the elements you wish to apply the fill to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"data-lab\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#data-lab\"\u003eData Lab\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreator: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/pavelkuligin93\"\u003ePavel Kuligin\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/740286071386014712/Data-Lab/\"\u003eData Lab\u003c/a\u003e is a plugin that lets you populate textual content using simple variables that you can combine into a single string and customize formatting. It comes with formatting for numbers, names, dates, telephone numbers, emails and lists (that use comma-separated values). For example, if you wanted a name, followed by an email address, separated by a middle-dot, you could input the following: \u003ccode\u003e{NAME} · {EMAIL}\u003c/code\u003e.

Out of the box, it’s loaded with names, phone numbers, US addresses, numbers, emails, URLs, companies, usernames, and countries. One of the coolest features of the plugin is that many of the data types are customizable via a drag-and-drop UI. Want to change how an address is formatted? Simply enable the attributes you want to include, and drag them into the desired order. You can even control the placement of the commas. Content Reel also gives you easy access to the Segoe MDL2 icon library (but make sure you install the \u003ca href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/style/segoe-ui-symbol-font#how-do-i-get-this-font\"\u003eSegoe icon-font\u003c/a\u003e to use them). The developers also plan to support image-based content for things like user-profile images in a future release. As an added bonus, one of the features I like most about this plugin is the compact mode which allows you collapse the UI into a small panel that you can leave open as you’re designing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"mapsicle\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#mapsicle\"\u003eMapsicle\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreator: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisarvinsf\"\u003eChris Arvin\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/736458162635847353/Mapsicle/\"\u003eMapsicle\u003c/a\u003e is a feature-packed plugin that allows you to add \u003ca href=\"https://www.mapbox.com/\"\u003eMapbox\u003c/a\u003e maps right into your design. To use it, simply select an element, launch Mapsicle, configure the map to your liking, and hit the \u0026#34;Create map\u0026#34; button to add it as an image fill to the element. To make the most of this plugin, you will want to have an \u003ca href=\"https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/access-token/\"\u003eaccess token from Mapbox\u003c/a\u003e, especially if you have defined your own map themes within Mapbox. In addition to being able to use your own themes, the plugin comes with support for default themes like Light, Dark, Satellite, Streets, and more. For each map, you can also control the zoom level as well as the camera pitch and rotation. Chris has also added some really handy features that allow you to update the size of an existing map without having to reset it each time. For example, you insert your map on a mobile design, and then move onto designing a tablet version—there is an option to \u0026#34;Refresh selected map\u0026#34; which will maintain the same zoom level and update it for the larger dimensions. One added tip—try nesting a map inside a smaller frame. In your prototyping settings you can configure the frame\u0026#39;s overflow behavior to \u0026#34;Horizontal \u0026amp; Vertical Scrolling\u0026#34; to give users the ability to pan across the map in both directions inside your prototypes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"uOfiBWAOmDAj\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe hope that these handy data population plugins help speed up your workflow and enhance the level of accuracy and realism in your mockups. Being able to use your actual data is a great way to stress test your design. It is also a great use-case for private plugins! Have sensitive data? Using your own internal API to deliver actual data in your app?

The security vulnerability was promptly fixed by the Realms shim team before the vulnerability was made public and we have no evidence it was ever exploited.

Our plugins API enables third-party developers to run code directly inside our browser-based design tool, so teams can adapt Figma to their own workflows. They can enable \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/732603254453395948/Stark/\"\u003eaccessibility checkers\u003c/a\u003e to measure contrast, \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/733062974250826253/Translate/\"\u003etranslation apps\u003c/a\u003e to convert language, \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/738454987945972471/Unsplash/\"\u003eimporters\u003c/a\u003e to populate designs with content, and anything else their heart desires.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe knew we needed to design this plugin functionality carefully. Throughout the history of software, there have been many instances where third-party extensions negatively affected a platform. In some cases, they slowed the tool to a crawl. In other cases, the plugins broke whenever new versions of the platform were released. To the extent that we could control it, we wanted users to have a better plugin experience with Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurthermore, we wanted to make sure plugins would be safe for users to run, so we knew we wouldn’t want to simply \u003ccode\u003eeval(PLUGIN_CODE)\u003c/code\u003e. That is the quintessential definition of insecure! Yet, eval is essentially what running a plugin boils down to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo add to the challenge, Figma is built on a very unconventional stack with constraints that previous tools haven’t had. Our design editor is powered by \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/\"\u003eWebGL\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/\"\u003eWebAssembly\u003c/a\u003e, with some of the user interface implemented in Typescript \u0026amp; React.

Ultimately, our efforts boiled down to one question: How do you run plugins with security, stability, and performance?

We had weeks of discussing, prototyping and brainstorming. This blog post will focus on just three of those attempts that formed the most central path in our exploration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor me, it has been the most satisfying exercise in first principles thinking. I had fun leveraging all the computer science fundamentals I learned in the classroom (the ones I never thought I’d ever use in the real world). If that idea excites you too, \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/careers/\"\u003ewe’re hiring\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"attempt-1-the-sandbox-approach\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#attempt-1-the-sandbox-approach\"\u003eAttempt #1: The  sandbox approach\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring our first few weeks of research, we found many interesting attempts at third-party code sandboxing. Some used techniques such as code-to-code transformation. However, most had not been validated in a production application and as such, carried some risk.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the end, for our first attempt, we went for the closest thing to a standard sandboxing solution: the \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e tag. It’s used in applications that need to run third-party code, such as CodePen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e is not your everyday HTML tag. To understand why \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003es are secure, it’s necessary to think about what properties they need to guarantee. An \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e is typically used to embed one website into another website. For example, in the screenshot below, you can see that yelp.com is embedding google.com/maps to provide map functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere, you wouldn’t want Yelp to be able to read what’s inside a Google website just by virtue of embedding it. There could be private user information in there. Similarly, you wouldn’t want Google to be able to read what’s inside a Yelp website just by virtue of having been embedded.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis means communication to and from the \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e is heavily restricted by browsers. When an \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e has a different origin than its container (e.g. yelp.com v.s. google.com), they are completely isolated. Then, the only way to communicate with the \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e is via message-passing. These messages are, for all intents and purposes, plain strings. Upon receipt, each website is free to take action on those message, or ignore them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey’re so isolated, in fact, that the HTML spec allow browsers to implement \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003es as separate processes, \u003ca href=\"https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/oop-iframes\"\u003eif they chose to\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that we know how \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003es work, we can implement plugins by creating a new \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e every time a plugin runs, and sticking the plugin’s code inside the \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e.

We even invited some alpha testers. However, it soon became clear that there were two major flaws with this approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"problem-1-async-await-is-not-user-friendly\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#problem-1-async-await-is-not-user-friendly\"\u003eProblem #1: async/await is not user friendly\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first feedback we got is that people were having trouble with having to use async/await. In this approach, it is unavoidable. Message-passing is fundamentally an asynchronous operation, and there’s no way in JavaScript to make a synchronous, blocking call to an asynchronous operation. At the very least, you need the \u003ccode\u003eawait\u003c/code\u003e keyword which also requires marking all calling functions \u003ccode\u003easync\u003c/code\u003e. All things considered, async/await is still a fairly new JavaScript feature that requires some non-trivial understanding of concurrency. This is a problem, because we expect many of our plugin developers to be designers who may be comfortable with JavaScript, but may not have formal CS education.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, if it were only necessary to use \u003ccode\u003eawait\u003c/code\u003e once at the beginning of the plugin and once at the end, it wouldn’t be so bad. We would just tell developers to always use \u003ccode\u003eawait\u003c/code\u003e with \u003ccode\u003eloadScene\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eupdateScene\u003c/code\u003e even if they don’t quite understand what it does.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problem is that some API calls require a lot of complex logic to run. Changing a single property on a layer sometimes cause multiple layers to update. For example, resizing a frame can recursively apply constraints to its children.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese behaviors are often complex and nuanced algorithms. It would be a bad idea to re-implement them again for plugins. That logic is also in our compiled WebAssembly binary, so it’s not easy to reuse. And if we don’t run that logic inside the plugin sandbox, plugins will be reading stale data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo while this is manageable:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan\u003eawait\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e figma\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eloadScene\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003edo\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e stuff \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eawait\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e figma\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eupdateScene\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis can get unwieldy very quickly, even for experienced engineers:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003cspan\u003eawait\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e figma\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eloadScene\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003edo\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e stuff \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eawait\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e figma\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eupdateScene\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eawait\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e figma\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eloadScene\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003edo\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e stuff \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eawait\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e figma\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eupdateScene\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eawait\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e figma\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eloadScene\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003edo\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e stuff \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e...\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eawait\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e figma\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003eupdateScene\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e(\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan\u003e)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"problem-2-copying-the-scene-is-expensive\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#problem-2-copying-the-scene-is-expensive\"\u003eProblem #2: copying the scene is expensive\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second problem with the \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e approach is that it requires serializing large parts of the document before sending them to the plugin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt turns out that people can create very, very large documents in Figma to the point of hitting memory limits.

Running on the main thread sounds an awful lot like \u003ccode\u003eeval(UNSAFE_CODE)\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe benefits of running on the main thread are that plugins can:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDirectly edit the document rather than a copy of it, eliminating loading time issues.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRun our complex component updating and constraints logic without needing to have two copies of that code.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMake synchronous API calls in situations where you’d expect a synchronous API. There would be no confusion with loading or flushing updates.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBe written in a more intuitive way: plugins are just automating actions that the user would otherwise do manually using our UI.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHowever, now we have these problems:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlugins can hang, and there is no way to interrupt a plugin.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlugins can make network requests as figma.com.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlugins can access and modify global state. This includes modifying our UI, creating dependencies on internal application state outside the API, or doing downright malicious things like changing the value of \u003ccode\u003e({}).__proto__\u003c/code\u003e  which poisons every new and existing JavaScript object.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe decided that we could drop the requirement for (1). When plugins freeze, it affects the perceived stability of Figma. However, our plugin model works such that they are only ever run on explicit user action. By changing the UI when a plugin runs, freezes would always be attributed to the plugin. It also means that it is not possible for a plugin to “break” a document.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-does-it-mean-for-to-be-dangerous\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-does-it-mean-for-to-be-dangerous\"\u003eWhat does it mean for  to be dangerous?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo deal with the issue of plugins being able to make network requests and access global state, we must first understand exactly what it means that “eval arbitrary JavaScript code is dangerous”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf a variant of JavaScript, let’s call it SimpleScript, had only the ability to do arithmetic such  \u003ccode\u003e7 * 24 * 60 * 60\u003c/code\u003e, it would be quite safe to \u003ccode\u003eeval\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can add some features to SimpleScript like variable assignment and if statements to make it more like a programming language, and it would still be very safe. At the end of the day, it still essentially boils down to doing arithmetic. Add function evaluation, and now you have lambda calculus and Turing completeness.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn other words, JavaScript doesn’t \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to be dangerous. In its most reductionist form, it’s merely an extended way of doing arithmetics. What \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e dangerous is when it has access to input \u0026amp; output. This includes network access, DOM access, etc. It’s \u003cstrong\u003eBrowser APIs\u003c/strong\u003e that are dangerous.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd APIs are all global variables. So hide the global variables!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"hiding-the-global-variables\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#hiding-the-global-variables\"\u003eHiding the global variables\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, hiding the global variables sounds good in theory, but it’s difficult to create secure implementations by merely “hiding” them. You might consider, for example, removing all properties on the \u003ccode\u003ewindow\u003c/code\u003e object, or setting them to \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e, but the code could still get access to global values such as \u003ccode\u003e({}).constructor\u003c/code\u003e. It would be very challenging to find all the possible ways in which some global value might leak.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRather, we need some stronger form of sandboxing where those global values never existed in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn other words, JavaScript doesn’t have to be dangerous. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsider the previous example of a hypothetical SimpleScript that only supports arithmetic. It’s a straightforward CS 101 exercise to write an arithmetic evaluation program. In any reasonable implementation of this program, SimpleScript would simply be unable to do anything other than arithmetic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, expand SimpleScript to support more language features until it becomes JavaScript, and this program is called an \u003cstrong\u003einterpreter\u003c/strong\u003e, which is how JavaScript, a dynamic interpreted language, is run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"attempt-2-compile-a-javascript-interpreter-to\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#attempt-2-compile-a-javascript-interpreter-to\"\u003eAttempt #2: Compile a JavaScript interpreter to WebAssembly\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eImplementing JavaScript is too much work for a small startup like ours. Instead, to validate this approach, we took \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/svaarala/duktape\"\u003eDuktape\u003c/a\u003e, a lightweight JavaScript interpreter written in C++ and compiled it to WebAssembly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo confirm that it works, we ran \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/tc39/test262/tree/es5-tests\"\u003etest262\u003c/a\u003e on it, the standard JavaScript test suite.

Duktape does not support any browser APIs — and that’s a feature! Furthermore, it runs as WebAssembly which itself is a sandboxed environment that has no access to browser APIs. In other words, plugin code can communicate with the outside world only through explicit whitelisted APIs by default.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt’s slower than regular JavaScript since this interpreter is not a JIT, but that’s ok.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt requires the browser to compile a medium-size WASM binary, which has some cost.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBrowser debugging tools don’t work by default, but we spent a day implementing a console for the interpreter to validate that it’d be at least possible to debug plugins.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDuktape only supports ES5, but it’s already common practice in the web community to cross-compile newer JavaScript versions using tools such as \u003ca href=\"https://babeljs.io/\"\u003eBabel\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e(Aside: a few months later, Fabrice Bellard released \u003ca href=\"https://bellard.org/quickjs/\"\u003eQuickJS\u003c/a\u003e which supports ES6 natively.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, compiling a JavaScript interpreter!

It’s still possible to access certain globals via expressions such as \u003ccode\u003e({}).constructor\u003c/code\u003e. Furthermore, the sandbox does need access to some globals. For example, \u003ccode\u003eObject\u003c/code\u003e is a global, often used in legitimate JavaScript code (e.g. \u003ccode\u003eObject.keys\u003c/code\u003e).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo give plugins access to these globals without messing up the window, the Realms sandbox instantiates a new copy of all these globals by creating a \u003cem\u003esame-origin\u003c/em\u003e iframe.

low-level interface can be implemented equally well with the Realms sandbox. Such an implementation is a relatively small amount of code (~500 LOC in our case). This small amount of code then needs to be audited carefully. However, once that is done, future APIs can be built on top of this interface without worrying about sandbox-related security issues.

While we are confident about the security of Realms, it never hurts to be extra careful when it comes to security. We recognize the possibility that Realms could have an undiscovered vulnerability that will one day turn into an issue we need to deal with. But this is why we had a few paragraphs talking about compiling an interpreter that we don’t even use. Because the API is implemented with an interface whose implementation can be interchanged, using an interpreter remains a valid backup plan that we could use without reimplementing any APIs or breaking any existing plugins.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"rich-functionality-in-plugins\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#rich-functionality-in-plugins\"\u003eRich functionality in plugins\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe now have a sandbox that can run arbitrary plugins safely, and an API that allows these plugins to manipulate Figma documents. This already opens up a lot of possibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the original problem we were trying to solve was to build a plugin system for a design tool. To be useful, most of these plugins will want the ability to create a user interface, and many will want some form of network access. More generally, we would like plugins to be able to leverage as much of the browser and JavaScript ecosystem as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe could expose safe, restricted versions of browser APIs one at a time, carefully, just like in the example of \u003ccode\u003econsole.log\u003c/code\u003e above. However, browser APIs (and the DOM in particular) is a huge surface area, larger than even JavaScript itself. Such an attempt would likely either be too restrictive to be useful or it could have a security flaw.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe solve this problem by reintroducing, yet again, the null-origin \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e.

Just specifying the right colors so that text has enough contrast, or providing a way for users to navigate your site with a keyboard can make all the difference in enabling them to use your product too. \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\"\u003eWCAG\u003c/a\u003e (Web Content AccessibilityGuidelines) publishes and maintains standards for creating accessible on-screen experiences and is a great resource to learn more. To meet these needs while working in Figma, there is a growing collection of accessibility-focused plugins to help you tackle these challenges in your own designs. In this weeks plugin-round up, we\u0026#39;ll take a closer look at some helpful plugins to help you make your designs better for everyone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#39;s start with color contrast. An important part of choosing the right color parings between text and the surfaces/backgrounds they reside on, is ensuring there is enough contrast so that the text is legible and readable by users with varying levels of vision. These plugins will help you identify if particular color combinations meet \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast\"\u003eWCAG AA or AAA\u003c/a\u003e standards. Each of these has their own unique features and user-interface, so feel free try them both to see which one works best for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"able\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#able\"\u003eAble\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreator: \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/user/582151016051772491/\"\u003eSondre Kvam\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAble is plugin designed to check color contrast—it will analyze the color of any two objects that you have selected. One feature that I like most about this plugin is that it updates as you change your selection. The plugin also takes your colors and gives you a text/background preview and an option that enables you to simulate what those colors will look like through the lens of different types of color blindnesses. And, you can swap the colors between the text and background color. As a bonus, in the menu to select a type of color blindness to simulate, you’ll see a data point by each that indicates what percentage of the population is affected by each type of color deficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"contrast-checker\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#contrast-checker\"\u003eContrast Checker\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreator: \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/user/582151016051772491/\"\u003eStark\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re coming from Sketch, you may already recognize this one. Stark displays the contrast ratio for any two objects that you select. It also gives you a contextual preview depending on whether or not one of your layers is a text layer or not. The plugin also displays a breakdown of your selected colors at both AA/AA+ and AAA/AAA+ ratings to show different levels of contrast ratios and a rating for if the font size used is over 18pts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"color-blind\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#color-blind\"\u003eColor Blind\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreator: \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/user/680883307046421033/\"\u003eSam Mason de Caires\u003c/a\u003e, UX Engineer at Cloudflare \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eColor Blind is a plugin designed to help you understand how your colors will look from the perspective of different types of color blindness. One of the unique things about this plugin is that it doesn\u0026#39;t just give you a preview of the colors you have chosen, but actually generates visuals on canvas based on whatever elements you have selected. The plugin will create duplicates of your design and change the colors to reflect each type of vision in an appropriately named group.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"focus-orderer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#focus-orderer\"\u003eFocus Orderer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreator: Tiffany Chen, UX designer at Microsoft\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eShifting gears from colors, let’s move on to Focus Orderer. Focus Ordered lets designers annotate their designs to indicate where and what order the browser should change the focus to. With this plugin, you can select an element and use the plugin to create a focal point. If you need to change the order of the focus, you can do it all in the plugin UI by dragging to change their order and Focus Orderer will take care of renumbering them all on canvas. You can also use the plugin to test and tab through all the elements as well. This is a great way to treat accessibility as a first-class citizen during your design to implementation process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"CNKuEWrR2j3s\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe hope that these accessibility plugins find a place in your Figma workflow.

But the value of a wireframe goes much further than simply getting your idea down on paper or \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/wireframe-tool/\"\u003edown in Figma\u003c/a\u003e. In this post, we’ll look at what defines a wireframe, what a good wireframe does and does not include, when a wireframe is most helpful, and how you can easily get started wireframing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-a-wireframe\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-is-a-wireframe\"\u003eWhat is a wireframe\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA wireframe is a simple visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or digital product. Think of it as the blueprint for your final design. You’re providing enough detail so that everyone knows the shape of the wall, but you’re not getting so deep into it that you’re giving exact details on the type of brick the walls should be made of (that comes later). Though wireframes are most often created by designers, they need to be basic enough so that everyone from other designers, stakeholders, devs, and users can understand the ideas. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWireframes are not the time to set anything in stone. In fact, the opposite. The power of wireframes is that they provide an opportunity to gather more information through usability research and stakeholder input. Because wireframes are so simple, people can more easily focus on functionality and the user experience rather than getting hung up on colors and other aesthetic elements. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"types-of-wireframes\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#types-of-wireframes\"\u003eTypes of wireframes\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a traditional design process, wireframes come after on-the-fly hand-drawn sketches and right before high-fidelity mockups or prototypes. There are two levels of wireframing, low fidelity and high fidelity — though you can go straight from a low fidelity wireframe to a prototype and skip high fidelity wireframing as a distinct step.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"low-fidelity-wireframing\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#low-fidelity-wireframing\"\u003eLow fidelity wireframing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLow fidelity is the most basic type of wireframing. It’s so simplistic, that paper and pen will still suffice as a way to represent your ideas, however, creating your wireframes in Figma will allow you to easily share them and make sure your team has access to your latest thinking as you iterate. Low fidelity wireframes are done in grayscale with a focus on layout and high-level interactions. UI elements and content are represented by basic shapes like squares, triangles, circles, and lines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eLow fidelifty wireframes utilize basical shapes to communicate page structure and layout.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"high-fidelity-wireframing\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#high-fidelity-wireframing\"\u003eHigh fidelity wireframing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHigh fidelity wireframing takes what you put together in the low fidelity stage and sprinkles in more of the detailed elements.

Consider the many different places, stages, and ways your design might be used. Three questions that might drastically influence your wireframe or versions of your wireframe include:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupported devices\u003c/strong\u003e — Your design adapts to support desktop and mobile.

Reducing the design to match how people will actually use it saves a lot of time and money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"when-to-use-a-wireframe\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#when-to-use-a-wireframe\"\u003eWhen to use a wireframe\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s almost no wrong time to use a wireframe, but there are some instances when they can be extra helpful. Whether you’re trying to explain your idea to someone, get all the stakeholders on the same page, force a group decision, or validate your plan, a wireframe presents a simple visual representation that everyone can point to. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet stakeholders to focus\u003c/strong\u003e — Because the magic of a wireframe lies in the simplicity, your clients, colleagues, and execs won’t get hung up on downstream details like colors and images. Instead, they’ll be forced to zero in on important structural elements. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCatch problems early\u003c/strong\u003e — Though they don’t present the actual functionality of a page, wireframes allow you to map out how all the elements will look and interact once the design is put into a working prototype. It’s way easier to re-work part of a wireframe than it is to rebuild a prototype or web application. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCut down on revision time\u003c/strong\u003e — Related to catching problems early, putting an idea in front of the team or a client in a wireframe gives everyone the opportunity to chime in at a time when it’s relatively easy to adjust and revise. By getting collective feedback early, you’ll cut down on revision time later. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDecide content prioritization\u003c/strong\u003e — Wireframes naturally reveal space constraints and the hierarchy of elements on the page, without relying on the content itself. Seeing the elements laid out anonymously will help everyone decide if the right weight is given to the most important content. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTest usability with users\u003c/strong\u003e — When you’re testing out a new idea with someone, they don’t need to see every little detail for you to determine if the idea is going to work. Wireframes give you just enough to work with so that you can validate your approach or pinpoint where adjustments are needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"wireframing-in-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#wireframing-in-figma\"\u003eWireframing in Figma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome designers like to continue sketching wireframes by hand using a blank sheet of computer paper, or dot grid journals.

They have been created to help improve workflows ranging from asset and data population to addressing accessibility requirements. There have also been a great number of, what I like to refer to as, \u0026#34;utility plugins\u0026#34; created. These plugins execute useful actions that accelerate repetitive tasks. In this post I\u0026#39;ll showcase some of the most interesting and useful plugins in this category, and demonstrate how you can use them in your workflow.

You\u0026#39;ll need to setup \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/54-constraints\"\u003econstraints\u003c/a\u003e on your elements first, then you can launch Viewports and use it to see how your mockup will look in the selected frame size. One of the most useful aspects to this plugin, is that for each frame size, it shows you the estimated global marketshare of of users browsing content from a specific device. This is really helpful to understand how prevalent certain viewport sizes are. Word on the street is Denis is expanding this to include desktop devices in a future release. Good news, you\u0026#39;ll have those features when they ship since there is no need to update your plugins in Figma!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"component-cloner\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#component-cloner\"\u003eComponent Cloner\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreator: \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/katekaho\"\u003eKate Miller\u003c/a\u003e, Computer Science student UC Santa Cruz  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHave you ever wanted to make a copy of a master component that is not an instance?

This plugin will make a copy of any master component and instances that you have selected. It\u0026#39;s been a great time saver in my own work. Take this use case: You have an icon component, and want to see what it looks like with a number of color overrides. Or perhaps you are building an icon sprite. Maybe you want to duplicate that component and all of its instances for the next icon that you\u0026#39;re designing?

Simply input or paste your text into a new text box and launch Nisa Text Splitter. Then you can use it to split the text into a separate text box at each line break. Following that, you can use the plugin (or \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/189-smart-selection\"\u003eSmart Selections\u003c/a\u003e) re-order them.

What started off as a browser extension has now been developed into a fully featured plugin. As you may have guessed, it enables you to find text across your document, and replace it. This plugin does however have a few additional tricks up its sleeve: in addition to replacing text strings on canvas you can also find and replace layers by name. Both operations support case-sensitivity and allow you to indicate where in the string you want to make the substitution: anywhere in the text, the beginning, the end, or only strings that match exactly. There is no shortage of use cases where this will come in handy, and the copywriters on your team will love it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"similayer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#similayer\"\u003eSimilayer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCreator: David Williames, Senior Product Designer for the Australia Post app  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may already be familiar with some of David\u0026#39;s work on Sketch plugins, and he has now already released \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/c/user/319620268789179331/\"\u003e6 for Figma!\u003c/a\u003e There is no shortages of use-cases for Similayer—this plugin will make a selection from whatever parameters you select. If you have ever used Figma\u0026#39;s native \u0026#34;Select all with same ____\u0026#34; functions from the Edit menu, you can already get a sense of how this plugin works. Simply select an element, launch Similayer, and add the parameters you want to find a match for. For example: you could use this to find all elements with the same border radius, or all elements with the same fill, stroke, border radius, and drop shadow! This plugin will save you MANY clicks the next time you need to edit a bunch of similar layers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"bonus-tip\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#bonus-tip\"\u003eBonus tip:\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can press \u003ccode\u003e⌘ + /\u003c/code\u003e (Mac) or \u003ccode\u003e*ctrl + /*\u003c/code\u003e (Windows) to open and shift focus to the menu search.

Figma designer \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rsms\"\u003eRasmus Andersson\u003c/a\u003e learned that first hand while creating \u003ca href=\"https://rsms.me/inter/\"\u003eInter\u003c/a\u003e — a font meant to make it easier to read text on computer screens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRasmus came up with the idea for Inter in his work on Figma. We\u0026#39;d used Roboto (designed by \u003ca href=\"https://christianrobertson.com/\"\u003eChristian Robertson\u003c/a\u003e for Google) as our main font for years, and we were running up against its limitations. It was originally built to work as both a display typeface (for things like titles) and text typeface (for longer blocks like paragraphs). But it was difficult to read Roboto when it was small (small text makes up much of the typography in Figma\u0026#39;s UI).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRasmus and the design team did a month-long research project to find a better-suiting option, but Roboto still came out on top and we stuck with it for several years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis experience got Rasmus thinking about text-heavy UIs and typefaces. He decided to try making his own font, designed solely for computer user interfaces, and offer it for free to the world. He released the first set of glyphs for Inter in August 2017, and he\u0026#39;s been iterating on it continuously ever since.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe sat down with Rasmus to get more back story on Inter and find out what goes into creating a brand new typeface.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=335\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"how-much-experience-did-you-have-with-creating\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how-much-experience-did-you-have-with-creating\"\u003eHow much experience did you have with creating typefaces before Inter?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eVery little.

Teams use design sprints for many different reasons like at the start of a new project, when time is on the line, to get a product or team unstuck, or to leverage new data or research. Some teams use design sprints as shortcuts to tackle big problems quickly, while other teams see design sprints as the most effective way to complete any project. The design sprint idea and methodology uses simple prototyping, user research, and user testing to solve complex problems. Since its inception, teams around the world have adopted, amended, expanded, and molded the original design sprint concept to meet their own needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this post, we’ll look at how design sprints were first created, provide a detailed plan for planning a design sprint, and give you the how-to for running your sprint. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-is-a-design-sprint\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-is-a-design-sprint\"\u003eWhat is a design sprint\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA design sprint is a tried and true methodology for solving big problems through designing, prototyping, and user research and testing. The sprint is set to run for a definite period, usually five business days, so that teams are encouraged to quickly align under a shared vision with defined goals and deliverables. The design sprint follows six phases: Understand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, and Validate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"google-design-sprint\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#google-design-sprint\"\u003eGoogle design sprint\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe design sprint methodology was developed at Google out of a need to build UX culture and design leadership across the organization.

The modern framework is flexible so that teams in any organization can adapt it to meet their specific needs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"plan-a-design-sprint\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#plan-a-design-sprint\"\u003ePlan a design sprint\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePreparing for a design sprint is just as important, if not more important, than the sprint itself. Don’t expect to get it all done in one day. For each day you’re planning to sprint, set aside a day for prep.

It should list your defined goals (the problem or problems you’re solving), deliverables, agenda, and methods. It should also provide the sprint team with background for the project and any user research that’s already available. You don’t want the team to waste any time looking for answers you already have, so be sure to include all relevant details in the sprint brief. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA design sprint is meant to tackle one big challenge at a time, so your brief should clearly reflect that. Anchor your sprint with one clear question to answer.

More people creating and iterating means more ideas and multiple versions of a prototype. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour design sprint team must include the people who are responsible for carrying out the work after the sprint. Design sprint teams typically include a UX designer, a user researcher, a product manager, a developer, and key members of leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"create-an-agenda\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#create-an-agenda\"\u003eCreate an agenda\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe simplest way to build your agenda is by following the six phases of methodology—Understand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, and Validate—but depending on your timeline and goals, you may need to modify to meet your needs. The design sprint team may already have a deep knowledge of the space and problem you’re working on, so you’d want to devote less time to the Understand phase and possibly reallocate the time to prototyping. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"build-visuals\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#build-visuals\"\u003eBuild visuals\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe sprint brief is just one important visual. Whether you choose to put together a deck or another preferred visual, make sure you have all anticipated references at hand. That includes screenshots of current websites, inspiration sources, data, research summaries, and anything else the team might need to know or want to quickly reference throughout the sprint. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"compile-user-research\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#compile-user-research\"\u003eCompile user research\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eRobust user research is what your design sprint team will rely on for clues on how to build a prototype. Without a few hints about what people want, the process could go off the rails fast. Exploratory research before the sprint can help guide new ideas and compiling existing data can help uncover how people are currently using the product, and the changes you might need to make to shape that behavior. This compiled data will help kick off the Understand phase. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"line-up-key-presenters\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#line-up-key-presenters\"\u003eLine up key presenters\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the compiled data, you may want to line up key speakers and external experts who can share a fresh perspective on the problem the team is working on. Google’s design sprint methodology calls these Lightning Talks since they’re meant to be a concise presentation lasting between 10-15 minutes. Helpful topics might include a summary of customer research from someone on the support team, competitive audits from an analyst, and a review of product performance from a product manager. You’ll need to reach out to and invite these presenters ahead of time, and be flexible if someone can’t join in person. An audio or video call is perfectly fine; any method that helps get the sprint team all the info they need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"book-an-ideal-spot\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#book-an-ideal-spot\"\u003eBook an ideal spot\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eA design sprint is all about creativity, so you want your meeting space to reflect that from the moment participants walk in. Find a spot with lots of light that you can make your own. That might mean moving furniture or taking over whiteboard walls. Don’t feel locked to the space for the duration of the sprint either. Break up the week with a field trip to a coffee shop or nearby park.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"line-up-an-ice-breaker\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#line-up-an-ice-breaker\"\u003eLine up an ice breaker\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn ice breaker is a great way to get everyone comfortable with each other and jumpstart creative thinking.

Reconfirm everyone who accepted the invitation will, in fact, be participating throughout the sprint. If people are dropping in here and there, the process isn’t nearly as effective.

Your sprint could last three days instead of five. It might devote just one morning to the Understand phase if participants already have a deep knowledge of the space and problem. Here we’ll cover every phase of the traditional design sprint methodology so you have the full gamut when it comes time to organize your design sprint. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"phase-1-understand\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#phase-1-understand\"\u003ePhase 1: Understand\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Understand phase is where all design sprint participants create a shared knowledge base. That base comes from provided info in the brief, Lightning Talks, user interviews, and exercises like Experience Mapping where the team maps out step by step the experience a user has within a problem space or context, and How Might We which encourages the team to reframe pain points as opportunities. \u003ca href=\"https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase1-understand\"\u003eSee Google’s entire compilation of Understand activities here\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"phase-2-define\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#phase-2-define\"\u003ePhase 2: Define\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the Define phase, the team uses everything they learned in the Understand phase to zero in on a specific focus for the sprint. They’ll also define goals, success metrics, and signals. One popular Define method is \u003ca href=\"https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase2-define/golden-path\"\u003eThe Golden Path\u003c/a\u003e, which requires participants to list out the possible user stories if the product already exists, or if the product does not exist yet, to sketch the ideal path through the new product. \u003ca href=\"https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase2-define\"\u003eSee more Define methods here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"phase-3-sketch\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#phase-3-sketch\"\u003ePhase 3: Sketch\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the Sketch phase, the sprint team individually generates as many ideas as possible.

Dot Vote is a simple exercise that gets to a decision quickly. Everyone gets three minutes to present their solution while the rest of the team can ask questions. Then, with all sketches hung up on the wall, each team member gets three total votes, represented by dot stickers. The sketch with the most stickers becomes the sprint focus. If you’ve already done your Sketch work in Figma, create a Figma component to use for dot votes.

Full product prototypes take a lot of time, but here we’re focused on speed and creating a representation of the solution that’s just detailed enough to get a response from a potential user. This usually means mapping out the exact flow and including only the steps you want to test. You can easily create \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/prototyping-tool/\"\u003eprototypes\u003c/a\u003e in Figma by simply ordering frames on your screen or linking objects with connectors.

Crucial notes during this process include user feedback and stakeholder and technical feasibility reviews. The sprint will end with a validated concept or a concept that still needs improvements, but comes with helpful feedback notes. Validating is all about getting the prototype in front of users, but there are \u003ca href=\"https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase6-validate\"\u003ea few different approaches you can take\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA design sprint is a kickoff to a larger project, so next steps after a sprint wraps should be clear from the beginning. Project or product managers should be able to provide clear action items to the team members responsible for seeing the project through. During the sprint, be sure to take ample notes and photos of the team’s work so that you can provide everyone with a complete summary of the process afterward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSprints are hard work!

Empowering other people to be creative is fun for me, and working on extensibility architectures is an even more fun version of that. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlugins were always in our future at Figma, but we wanted to do things differently with our platform architecture. Plugins are critical components to a designer’s workflow that can serve as little power-ups and help extend Figma’s product functionality. However, as important as they are, design plugins to date have not yet met the call of duty. We saw two primary problems:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAlthough designers rely on plugins, design plugins are not always reliable or secure. This is because they’re often built on not fully-supported APIs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDesigners are at the mercy of others to build plugins for them, unless they themselves know how to code. And getting engineering resources is never easy.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eFortunately, I got to work with super talented engineers and powerhouse plugin developers from our community to help figure out these challenges. We wanted our plugins to be secure, stable, and performant, of course. But we also wanted Figma plugin programming to feel like web programming. Our internal motto is: “If you can code a webpage with basic HTML and JavaScript, you can build a Figma plugin.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt turns out that there were a lot of technical challenges to make this happen (which we will cover in a later engineering blog post). We also had to figure out—for the first time in the design tooling space—what a plugin architecture looked like for a web-based platform. But in architecting our plugins platform in this manner, our hope was that these upfront investments would allow more plugin creators to build more creative, interesting plugins\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma plugins make it easy to advocate for myself and others by giving me the ability to create the design tools we need, rather than crossing our fingers and hoping someone else will make them for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Tiffany Chen, UX Designer at Microsoft\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter just 6 weeks in beta, we now have over 40 public plugins available to the Figma community—with more added every day.

Later in life when I stumbled upon UX design, that same passion for building things was reignited. In my journey as a UX designer, I picked up some coding skills along the way, so I can actually build the products I design and see it all come together. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What do you do to get inspired?A:\u003c/strong\u003e I look to what others are doing in the space and try to draw connections between elements of their work into my own projects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What Figma plugins are you building?A:\u003c/strong\u003e I’m most excited about the Find and Replace plugin I’ve built for the Figma community. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve also built a Paste to Fill plugin,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003ea Button Resizer plugin,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e...and so many more! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Was this your first time building a plugin? How did you get started?A:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, this is my first time building plugins for any system. It actually all started from the Microsoft OneWeek Hackathon in 2018. My team wanted to do something with building accessibility features into our design tools (we were already using Figma at that time). Since Figma is built on the web, I got curious and started to explore Figma’s platform. After discovering some functions which allowed me to simulate user actions programmatically, I got completely hooked. Every little new function I found opened up a world of possibilities for me. This is why I really appreciate how easy and stable the official API is today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What piece of work are you most proud of?A:\u003c/strong\u003e Ironically, Figma Plus. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInitially, I built my first hacky plugin in the form of Chrome extensions that only worked on the browser. After receiving a lot of positive feedback from the community, I realized there was a huge need for the plugin to work on Figma’s desktop app (because that’s where most users do their work). So I teamed up with \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/mirkosantangelo\"\u003eMirko Santangelo\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/cdes\"\u003eAhmad Al Haddad\u003c/a\u003e, who had also worked on a few plugins, to develop a platform that aggregates our knowledge of the Figma API. All three of us are over-achievers so what started as a small project eventually turned into a complete system with our own API, plugin store, and publishing process. So when Figma officially launched their plugins beta, of course the three of us wanted to be a part of it. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How do you see the design community evolving over the next 5 years?A:\u003c/strong\u003e  Designers and developers will become closer in their workflows, especially as future design tools continue to bridge the gap that exists today. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why are you building for the Figma community?A:\u003c/strong\u003e Figma has become the primary design tool in Microsoft, so it only makes sense for me to start building on the platform that helps my team\u0026#39;s workflow and expand outward from there. \u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"uZiQHu3T-Hmw\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn August 1, Jackie’s plugins will be available to the Figma community. \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/plugins-launch-event/\"\u003eTune in to watch our announcement live\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

As a kid, I would spend more time modding, hacking, and re-designing games than actually playing them. I started to learn about generative art in 2014 while making small demos in the browser with JavaScript. Some of the demos would produce images that evolved and changed over time, always producing new and unique imagery. I was really fascinated by the concept of emergence, exploring how complex images and artworks can be produced from a simple set of rules and parameters fed into a computer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What piece of work are you most proud of?A:\u003c/strong\u003e One of my favourite projects was building \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/261406016\"\u003eLUMOS\u003c/a\u003e.

Why is it important to you to bridge art and code?A:\u003c/strong\u003e For me, combining code and art feels natural. It becomes a collaboration between me and the computer, where code is a tool—much like a brush or pen—that acts as a bridge between me and the machine. I can lay down instructions, rules, and parameters, and the computer can execute those millions of times in a second without ever tiring. This collaboration helps free my imagination from my own human limitations, and can also produce some surprising and unexpected results that can spawn ideas for new artworks (for example, an error in my code).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why are you building plugins for the Figma community?A:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0026#39;m hoping my plugins inspire designers to explore more code, and developers to explore more design.

Tiffany joined Microsoft after graduating from Brown University in 2018 to be at the intersection of accessibility, inclusivity, education, design, and technology. This is the first time she’s built a design plugin! \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Microsoft’s focus on accessibility both internally and externally, Tiffany hopes to help create more awareness around making product experiences more inclusive.

In building for the Figma community, I spend much more time on making things rather than debugging or trying to get stuff set up.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDesign tools just don’t have every single feature a designer would want. Figma plugins make it easy to advocate for myself and others by giving me the ability to create the design tools we need, rather than crossing our fingers and hoping someone else will make them for us.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Figma community is super supportive and fun!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What do you hope to achieve by contributing to the design community?A:\u003c/strong\u003e I love helping other people start their own non-traditional design journey! It’s always very exciting to me when someone reaches out asking how they can become a designer when they’re currently in a psychology,  anthropology,  international relations, or computer science role. I think the design community will always need more of that diversity in perspectives, knowledge, and experience. For example, since my background is in computer science, my evaluation and implementation of designs tend to sit on the cusp of feasibility and novelty. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What design project are you most proud of?A:\u003c/strong\u003e I embarked on a project where I asked people odd questions like, “What lies were you told as a child?” The idea was to prompt them to tell me stories about their lives. After getting the responses, I illustrated their stories and turned them into an \u003ca href=\"https://tiffanyc.me/storiesbook/\"\u003eart-dev website\u003c/a\u003e using layering and parallax. This project is what really started getting me excited about combining my technical and creative sides.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What company or designer do you look up to or aspire to?A:\u003c/strong\u003e The principles behind B Corporation are super interesting to me. Basically, every decision that a B Corp certified company makes has to factor in the impact that the decision will have on its workers, customers, suppliers, and the environment. Some famous B Corps include Ben \u0026amp; Jerry\u0026#39;s, Kickstarter, and Patagonia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What do you think the design industry needs more of?A:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0026#39;d love to see increased accessibility in the design space—not just greater awareness of what it means to make products and experiences that are inclusive to all, but also decreased barriers to entry for people who want to become designers. I think we’re making great progress on the latter front now that so many resources are posted online.

That\u0026#39;s what led me down the path of becoming a developer. At the same time, I’ve always enjoyed design and recognized that there is a lot of crossover between design and development.

Here’s a sneak peek at one of the color reference plugin:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Why are you building for the Figma community?A:\u003c/strong\u003e I find the idea of a design tool with an API to be an interesting one. Things that are often tedious and done by hand can easily be automated if we have access to the underlying code of the tool, therefore giving designers more time to work on the meaningful parts of their process, like designing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How do you see the design community evolving over the next 5 years?A:\u003c/strong\u003e I think there will be big enhancements in generative design. So rather than individually designing each possible state, you will instead be able to pass in data that describes what you want and the tools will be able to generate all the possible variations. Then you, as a designer, would decide the best facets of each one to make the fully formed final output. I would urge anyone who wants to learn more to read \u003ca href=\"https://mrmrs.cc/writing/chaos-design/\"\u003eAdam Morse’s post on Chaos Design\u003c/a\u003e.

They allow for the team to come together at the end of a project or sprint and evaluate how things went by writing on a whiteboard (or post-its).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are a few drawbacks to this approach. It can be a bit intimidating to stand up and write in front of an audience.

Because Figma is multiplayer, everyone can jump in the file at the same time and see each other\u0026#39;s text easily. Figma\u0026#39;s collaborative features (like commenting) ensure every person in the room can contribute.

It can be difficult to step outside your own perspective and craft your story in a way that’s compelling to others. You have to return to old projects and describe their narrative and meaning in fresh, compelling ways. You must also put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into the arrangement of your work so it’s presented clearly. Crafting a portfolio is no small feat, but if you do it right, you’ll reap major dividends in the job search process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI see a lot of portfolios in my work as a design recruiter here at Figma. Applicants often make the same mistakes again and again — from including far too much text in project highlights, to overcomplicating animations on their landing page.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI recommend you build your portfolio the same way you would tackle any design challenge: Start by putting yourself in the shoes of your target audience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"know-your-audience-and-your-goal\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#know-your-audience-and-your-goal\"\u003eKnow your audience and your goal\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTypically in the product design industry, the person who reviews your portfolio and decides whether to interview you will be:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA design manager\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA creative director\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA head of design\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA VP of design\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeaders like this are very busy. They’re often running between meetings, phone calls, and interviews, so unfortunately sometimes they have limited time to review portfolios (we’re talking minutes, or even seconds). They’re trying to quickly parse a lot of information in that short period of time:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat type of design you do\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhere your talents and passions lie\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhether you have the right experience for this particular role\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow you tackle design challenges\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYour overall design abilities\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAssume they’re dealing with limited time, and won’t always be able to dig through pages of content.  Instead, you need to highlight the most pertinent information for the particular role you’re applying for. In this post, I’ll teach you how to do that as effectively as possible, both with your portfolio’s landing page and with your individual projects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"landing-page\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#landing-page\"\u003eLanding page\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"make-previews-of-projects-easy-to-parse\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#make-previews-of-projects-easy-to-parse\"\u003eMake previews of projects easy to parse\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe key to the perfect landing page is to structure each project thumbnail in a cohesive way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, if you’ve done recent projects for a range of top-tier companies and want to show off their logos, make sure each logo thumbnail is the same size. If instead you want your landing page to represent the actual work you did for different projects, then make sure the screenshots are styled similarly (like with the same color background and dropshadow). Whatever your approach, I recommend labeling each project with key details (like the company name, your role in the project, and the medium you worked in) in a consistent, parsable format.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s nothing that makes me happier than opening a portfolio and seeing 8 equally sized, thoughtfully crafted rectangles. After all, recruiters have to skim hundreds of portfolios for hours at a time. We’re a lot more likely go through every project in a portfolio if the landing page has an aesthetically pleasing system to it. It takes less mental energy to comprehend it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, all good rules are meant to be broken. If you have a really creative way of laying out project that indicates which one matters most, go for it! Just make sure the thumbnail differences are the result of thoughtful layout decisions, not haphazard design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"get-to-the-good-stuff\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#get-to-the-good-stuff\"\u003eGet to the good stuff\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow many \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6rHeD5x2tI\"\u003eclicks\u003c/a\u003e does it take to get to your work?

Make that clear by highlighting your experience in that area. Are you dying to quit the e-commerce industry and want to move into fintech, healthcare, or something else? Choose previous work accordingly. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Tailor your projects” may seem like obvious advice, but applicants often struggle with this. They try to capture the entire breadth of their design career in one portfolio. They assume people will take the time to go through everything  — but hiring managers often can’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s a few other challenges you may face in picking projects, with a few tips for overcoming them:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. You worked at top tier brands...a long time ago.\u003c/strong\u003eDon’t stock your portfolio with projects from the mid nineties — even if that \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e the time in your career you worked at Apple. Instead, rely on your resume to show the breadth of brands you worked at, and let your portfolio shine a light on your contemporary work. Of course, if you designed the famous iPod silhouette campaign in the early 2000s, please do highlight that. But don’t feel the need to stick in work that doesn’t represent you as a designer anymore just to show off the brand names.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.  You don’t have the experience for the sector you want to focus on.\u003c/strong\u003eIf all of your work is in mobile but you dream of designing for the web, you may struggle with tailoring your portfolio. I recommend doing a few side projects to develop web-first content, instead of submitting your mobile-only portfolio and hoping for the best. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, it’s not just mobile → web where this challenge can spring up. Print designers often want to go into UX/UI design. Visual designers dream of UX research roles. Engineers hope to double-down on front-end ideation. Design is an ever-changing field!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Your best work is not in the right medium or industry.\u003c/strong\u003eLet’s say you have design projects in a range of fields, but your best stuff isn’t in the right vertical for the job you’re applying for. You kicked some serious ass on a recent mobile project, but you want a web-based design job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsider creating a mockup of how that same design would’ve looked and functioned on the web, then include both the original and the mockup in your portfolio. As long as you have enough other web-based projects to indicate your experience, we’ll consider you as a candidate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. You actually want a generalist role\u003c/strong\u003eIf you’re interested in becoming an early designer at an early stage startup or joining a smaller company where you have to wear a lot of hats, ignore my previous advice! In the case of generalist roles, you should demonstrate the breadth of experience you have with clearly labeled projects. Make it obvious what medium you did the work in, what your personal role in the project was, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34b16c9c724b04f5d66c2c39a493abab6036bac1-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=469\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34b16c9c724b04f5d66c2c39a493abab6036bac1-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34b16c9c724b04f5d66c2c39a493abab6036bac1-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34b16c9c724b04f5d66c2c39a493abab6036bac1-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34b16c9c724b04f5d66c2c39a493abab6036bac1-1000x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1000w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-to-highlight-in-each-project\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-to-highlight-in-each-project\"\u003eWhat to highlight in each project\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuch like with your landing page, you should be judicious and thoughtful in selecting what aspects of your projects to highlight.

Simply add a GIF to your file and watch it come to life when you click “Present.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether you’re prototyping a mobile app, designing a product user flow, or putting together a presentation, GIFs are a simple way to make your designs more dynamic—and perhaps bring smiles to a few faces. GIFs can stand in for motion designs, video elements, and subtle animations that can otherwise be hard to represent faithfully in prototypes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s how GIFs in Figma prototypes work: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdd a GIF to your Figma file.\u003c/strong\u003e Some of our favorite tools for GIF creation are ScreenFlow, LICEcap, Principle, and After Effects.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eClick “Present”\u003c/strong\u003e and watch your prototype come to life.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause GIFs only animate in prototypes, they will appear as a static image in your file. To help you differentiate between multiple similar GIFs, you can select the cover frame that’s displayed in the editor by opening the GIF modal from the properties panel and scrubbing to a different frame. This is incredibly helpful if your GIF has a blank first frame, or if you have multiple GIFs with the same starting frame. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, if you’re creating a mobile prototype, you will also notice improved OS-aware momentum scrolling and new touch cursors—a few details we introduced to make your design feel like the real thing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor some inspiration as you try out these new features, here are some of our favorite animated moments around the Web.

In Bonnie’s words, “there aren\u0026#39;t many people who love to design icons and even fewer who are great at it.

They work with companies like Nike, Google, Airbnb, Sonos, and LinkedIn on product design, new tech innovation, branding, marketing, strategy — the works. They care deeply about delivering a complete design system, rather than a one-off solve, and also value creating reusable functional components that can be used across myriad applications and at scale. But of course, getting to a shared place of understanding with the client on what that means and what that looks like takes a high degree of collaboration.

Whether you\u0026#39;re moving across the country or down the street, it\u0026#39;s never fun. The biggest pain isn\u0026#39;t necessarily the packing, cleaning, or unpacking —instead, it\u0026#39;s the new routines you\u0026#39;re forced to adopt. You\u0026#39;re probably still going to store your silverware in a drawer in the kitchen, but now that drawer sits to the left of the sink instead of the right. It takes time to retrain your muscle memory that tells you to reach to the right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a similar fashion, moving from a tool like Sketch to Figma can be a bit of a struggle at first. The UI is slightly different, the keyboard shortcuts aren\u0026#39;t all the same, and there are some core differences that take a little while to get used to. I remember when I switched to Figma, I had to work on a real project for a solid week or so to finally feel comfortable with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, if you\u0026#39;ve recently made the move to Figma (or are considering doing so), I hope this article helps you understand the differences and similarities. We want Figma to feel like home as quickly as possible for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe nice thing about moving from Sketch to Figma is that you get to keep all of your old designs. We have \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/81-import#sketch\"\u003ean import feature\u003c/a\u003e that allows you to bring in individual Sketch files into your Figma account.

A year ago, we \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-platform/\"\u003elaunched the HTTP-based Figma API\u003c/a\u003e, which customers can use to export Figma data to other tools. Since then, it’s been amazing to see the workflows people have developed. The Volvo Car Mobility team built custom Slack commands to export Figma icons into documents. \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/https-blog-figma-com-microsoft-automates-design-handoff-with-figmas-api/\"\u003eMicrosoft\u003c/a\u003e automatically pushes design file updates to their development environment. \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/github-case-study/\"\u003eGitHub\u003c/a\u003e is now updating and distributing their SVG icon library, Octicons, more effectively. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also saw a powerhouse team of designers and developers—Jackie Chui, Ahmad Al Haddad, and Mirko Santangelo—create a space for Figma users to share functionality built with our APIs. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve been inspired by what our customers have created on top of our platform thus far. And we know many of you have dreams to do much more, like developing (and using!) plugins to further hone your design process. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, we’ve seen the challenges plugins can introduce to a design platform. We wanted to be thoughtful in how we open up our plugin APIs so builders have confidence in our platform’s stability and security.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, developers should never have to worry about their Figma plugins breaking, even when we ship new features and updates. That’s why we’ve explicitly designed our APIs for third parties to use, rather than just opening up our internal APIs. As many of you know, internal APIs tend to change, which results in extra work for 3rd party developers (they have to update their software for each platform release) and a bad experience for users (they have to worry about their favorite plugins breaking).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe wanted to make sure we did things right. When embarking on this project, we established a few principles to guide us:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlugins should be easy and intuitive to use for any designer.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you can build a website, you should be able to make a plugin.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePeople should be able to author plugins with popular programming languages.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePlugins should not be detrimental to the performance and user experience of Figma.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFigma should fully support and maintain all APIs that plugins rely on.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese principles will hopefully ensure plugins feel core to our product, for both developers and the end-users. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo if you know basic HTML and JavaScript, we invite you to \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/plugins-beta\"\u003eapply to join our plugins beta\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-can-you-do-in-the-beta\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-can-you-do-in-the-beta\"\u003eWhat can you do in the beta?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can build plugins that speed up your design workflow.

As a result, you\u0026#39;ll need to establish patterns for consistent, legible typography early in the process of creating your design system. Doing so will make it easier for you to scale typography across multiple applications and devices, without complicating the handoff between designers and developers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this article we cover what you should think through when it comes to working with type in Figma.

Instead of handing off designs to them at the end of the process, I was able to involve them from the beginning. From the moment I started wireframing, I\u0026#39;d share the Figma URL — which stays up to date since Figma files are on the web — and they would give feedback and ask important clarifying questions. The resulting conversations shaped the designs in meaningful ways. It also helped us avoid any big surprises when designs were ready to be implemented in code.

Even if they have view-only access, they can now select a component instance and choose \u0026#34;go to main component\u0026#34; from the context menu (or alternatively in the \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/32-developer-handoff\"\u003ecode view\u003c/a\u003e of the right-hand properties panel) just like editors of the file. Figma will then take them to the location of the parent component, whether it\u0026#39;s located in the same file or a different one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy seeing where the component is coming from, the developer has more context. They can deduce whether a component is part of the official design system or if it\u0026#39;s a new element created by the designer for this specific project. That helps them figure out whether it already exists in their system, or if it needs to be built from scratch. In comparing the main component to the instance, the developer can also better understand the nature of the overrides that were applied to the instance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you think this new functionality will be useful, make sure developers on your team have view access to your libraries as well (otherwise they may get taken to a file where a main component resides, only to arrive at a 404 error 😆 ).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"component-descriptions-in-the-code-panel\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#component-descriptions-in-the-code-panel\"\u003eComponent descriptions in the code panel\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second tweak we made is with component descriptions.

To help streamline and speed up your prototype creation workflow, I collected a few of my favorite tips and tricks for you. Read on!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_1-use-master-components-to-speed-up-prototype\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_1-use-master-components-to-speed-up-prototype\"\u003e1. Use master components to speed up prototype connections\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026#39;s say you\u0026#39;re designing a screen with some sort of persistent navigation, like a tab bar. You have to link each menu item to a specific frame (like linking the \u0026#39;home\u0026#39; button back to the home frame). If that menu is repeated across multiple screens, as tab bars often are, the tedious task of linking can take way longer than it should.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTHERE\u0026#39;S A BETTER WAY. Early in your process, turn your hamburger menu into a component. Once you\u0026#39;ve done that, link each menu item of that master component to the appropriate frame. Moving forward, any time you create an instance of the hamburger component, all the connections will automatically propagate! No more beating your head against a wall with busy work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne caveat: This doesn\u0026#39;t work if you\u0026#39;re dragging an instance of a component from a team library. Because the master component is located in a different file than yours, out of the gate, you won\u0026#39;t be be able to leverage the previously mentioned tip.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead, create a new master component with the instance from your library inside it. Figma allows you to deep select down into the nested layers within each component, so you can still link multiple menu items from the instance without it detaching from the master. I often place some of these repeated components off to the side, outside my mockups, as a convenient place to access them and maintain the linked connections to different screens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eLink to Figma file\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_2-use-components-for-scrolling-content\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_2-use-components-for-scrolling-content\"\u003e2. Use components for scrolling content\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you\u0026#39;re designing longer scrolling screens with fixed elements, such as status bars, headers or footers, you can simply drag the bottom of the frame down to accommodate the extra content. If the content exceeds the height of the viewport for the device you selected, Figma will automatically scroll the frame when in prototype mode. Handy, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut there are times when you want to see what\u0026#39;s visible in the viewport by default (i.e. before the user scrolls). That gives you a sense of what content is initially cut off when users first navigate to that prototype frame. Devices with different viewport sizes will segment the content in different places. To make it easy to peruse these different views, use a component.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo see what content is initially visible in a scrollable frame:  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1) Turn your scrolling content into a component.2) Make sure you\u0026#39;ve set up \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/54-constraints\"\u003econstraints\u003c/a\u003e for all of the elements inside.3) Ensure  \u0026#34;clip content\u0026#34; is checked in the properties panel (this should be enabled by default).4) Flip to prototyping mode and enable the scrolling direction you want by configuring the \u0026#34;Overflow Behavior.\u0026#34;5) Place an instance of this component within your designs and resize them to fit.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow you can get an idea of what is in view for each device size and manage all of your scrolling content centrally with a single component.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eLink to Figma file\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_3-timed-delays-and-overlays-to-simulate\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_3-timed-delays-and-overlays-to-simulate\"\u003e3. Timed delays and overlays to simulate interactions\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith prototypes, instant interactions can feel abrupt for the end user. You may want to add elements of realism, like simulating loading screens or adding a short delay. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne light-touch way you can use to do this is through the \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/199-getting-started-with-prototyping#triggers\"\u003eafter delay trigger\u003c/a\u003e, where an interaction takes place after a set duration.

By using overlays, with manual positioning and the swap overlay feature, we can create a simple button interaction in tandem with timed delays. The user then experiences a submit interaction, brief loading sequence and success message before the confirmation page appears.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eLink to Figma file\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_4-a-table-of-contents\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_4-a-table-of-contents\"\u003e4. A table of contents\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrototypes in Figma are currently limited to single pages. This allows you to have separate prototypes in a single document, all with their own unique URLs that you can share with people when they want to view them. But sometimes, you just want to share one link to people that lets them see multiple design options.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo do this in Figma, create a table of contents frame as your prototype starting screen. Then, link each list item in the TOC to a different user flow. From the back-end Figma will interpret all of this as one prototype, but end users will experience them as different prototypes with a selection between them at the start. Note: All your user flows must be on the same page for this to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?rect=1,0,2449,1622\u0026amp;w=693\u0026amp;h=459\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?w=693\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 347w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?w=693\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 520w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?w=693\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 693w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?w=693\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1040w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?w=693\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1386w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eLink to Figma file\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_5-using-observation-mode\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_5-using-observation-mode\"\u003e5.

For example, we now have a \u0026#34;Design Systems\u0026#34; channel, which gives people a place to chat about best practices, ask questions about how other teams set up their libraries in Figma, and share resources. The same goes for new channels like \u0026#34;Prototyping,\u0026#34; \u0026#34;API and Extensions,\u0026#34; and \u0026#34;Workflow and Process.\u0026#34; \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe\u0026#39;ve also created a new channel called \u0026#34;Open Design.\u0026#34; This is a space for our users to share what they\u0026#39;re working on, get feedback, and even find other designers to help on projects.

Today marks another step on that journey: we’re altering the way we handle text. Figma will now distribute extra line height above and below letters, and it will measure line height in a more modern way. It’s a purely optional change — none of your existing files will change in any way, and you can choose whether to update old text at your own pace.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese modifications may seem simple; our path to get there was anything but. To find the right solution for our users, we dove into the beautifully complex world of type and vertical alignment, studying how laying out text evolved since Gutenberg, and how computers — first graphical user interfaces, then the web — further complicated the issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis historical baggage — and the fact that Figma is used in so many different ways — made it challenging to come up with one ideal solution. We did a lot of research and testing, and we\u0026#39;re excited to introduce what we came up with. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’d like to get straight to the details, you can \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/line-height-changes/#changes-to-figma\"\u003ejump to them\u003c/a\u003e in this post or read about them in our \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/283-changes-to-line-height\"\u003esupport doc\u003c/a\u003e.

There were two main roles — type designer and typesetter — and their work was constrained by the rules of the physical universe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt also helped that by late 1800s, the type industry had figured out most of the basics. A life of a typeface would start on paper, with a type designer spending weeks or months sketching all the necessary letterforms. After they were done, the drawings of the typeface were turned into a font: actual physical blocks of lead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou needed to buy one or more such blocks for each letter. You also needed to buy additional metal blocks for different sizes of text. But font size wasn’t defined as the size of the letters — it was the height of the metal block holding them, expressed in a unit known as point (each point was a 1/72 of an inch, or about 0.4mm). The block height was known, but within it, the type designer could do whatever they wanted: Fonts of the same size could be bigger or smaller, their baseline (the line each letter “sits” on) placed higher or lower, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=400\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFour metal fonts with the same, 16pt font size.

First, they distributed the extra space that was once a strip of lead both above and below each line. They nicknamed the new system “\u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/#the-height-of-lines\"\u003ehalf-leading\u003c/a\u003e.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eLeading on screens (left) and half-leading on the web (right)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI reached out to the creators of CSS to understand the rationale behind the change. They explained to me that while \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-css1-951117.html\"\u003eearly proposals for web style sheets matched the print universe\u003c/a\u003e, they had good reasons for deciding to go with half-leading. Namely, web’s text boxes had more responsibilities. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the world of print or early programs, a text box only needed to hold the text inside it. The web asked it to do more. “I was aware half-leading wasn’t a traditional typographic concept,” mentioned Bert Bos, who worked on CSS1 in 1995 and 1996. \u0026#34;But the problem I had with adding leading only below the lines was what happened to a paragraph when you put a background behind it or a border around it.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf leading appeared only at the bottom of such a box, that box would feel bottom-heavy and would require additional work to look good. Half-leading offered a way out of this new problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other change CSS introduced? The 100% line height was redefined as “100% of font size.” Before, a font designer might have given a 16-pixel font a default line height of 20 pixels. But on the web, 100% line height of a 16-pixel font came to be exactly 16 pixels, regardless of what the original designer dictated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reason for that change was simple: knowing the default line height of a font required loading that font, which could be really slow on the early internet. Multiplying line height by font size, on the other hand, could be done immediately. “We wanted to do as many calculations as possible without having to load the font,” mentioned Håkon Wium Lie, co-creator of CSS. Line height no longer understood the font inside — luckily, the fonts weren’t required to fit within physical boxes, so that wasn’t that big of a problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=400\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSee the variety in four digital fonts with 16pt font size and 100% line height on the web.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so, the same font as before would have a size of 16 pixels — but a line height of 20 pixels would now be expressed as 125% or 1.25, since 16×1.25 gives exactly 20.

consistency issues, the workflow for the system and the tools required to support it were keeping the team from working efficiently and collaboratively on core components.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We had some painful steps in our workflow that made it restrictive and confusing for contributors who wanted to iterate or update things like icons in our SVG icon library,” says Jon Rohan, system designer and engineer at GitHub. “People needed to have specific software installed and knowledge of certain tools to make contributions.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo resolve the issues with updating the icon library, called Octicons, GitHub kicked off an experiment with Figma. “We got excited about Figma because it didn\u0026#39;t require downloading and installing software as part of the workflow to update icons,” says Mounter. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Rohan, it was the combination of Figma and the Figma API that would allow GitHub to make the contributing experience as frictionless as possible. “By migrating Octicons to Figma and using the Figma API, we could automate the workflow, which allows people to contribute to the design system using powerful, platform-agnostic design tools without any complex setup.” For the full story on Octicons, checkout the \u003ca

collaboration\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the team has always been tool-agnostic, Figma’s use began to spread like wildfire. As a remote team, the fact that Figma is web-based design enabled them to overcome the physical separation and begin collaborating in a very real and efficient way. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Being able to jump in the same file with someone fills the gap of not being able to gather around a whiteboard with someone,” says Mounter. “Figma replaced the whiteboard for us.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKathy Zheng, senior product designer at GitHub couldn’t agree more. “For the first time since joining GitHub, I can experience design collaboration and get all of the benefits of a team that\u0026#39;s physically together. And perhaps it\u0026#39;s even more fun than whiteboarding because you have powerful features at your fingertips.”\u003cbr/\u003eFor Zheng, Figma puts creativity back into the process. “No matter where you are in your design process, how do you play a little bit, so that you might stumble across something novel?” she asks. “The moment that I started doing design jams where I was jamming in Figma files with other designers, I got that feeling back, that by disseminating an idea, we can create gravity and momentum around it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday Zheng uses Figma for “basically everything that revolves around storytelling.” Design is storytelling and prototyping puts a story in action. “Prototyping is now a integral part of my workflow because it is so easy,” she says. “I can quickly drag stuff around to suggest the flow I\u0026#39;m designing for without switching tools.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eGitHub is a space for collaboration.

The ultimate success is seeing Figma usage spread across the GitHub organization.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma helps designers at GitHub expose more about what happens between the start of an idea and the finished design. According to Mounter, “there\u0026#39;s less of a barrier to getting access to work-in-progress for people outside of the design team which means more people can participate and more innovation happens.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat collaboration is at the heart of what GitHub has always been about — creating something amazing by bringing individuals and teams together in one place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother designer and I were jamming together in a Figma design file, just exploring, having fun and bouncing ideas off of each other.

The book was fascinating to me because it helped codify the many ways a grid could provide structure and consistency, improve  readability, and create emphasis and hierarchy in design. It\u0026#39;s the first text to formalize many of these concepts into such concise words, and it\u0026#39;s probably one of the most important tomes on the topic. In the design world, there\u0026#39;s a common joke that you can tell how long someone has been a designer by the color of the spine of their Müller-Brockmann copy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy carefully constructing a grid that\u0026#39;s suitable to your content, you can define structure, hierarchy, and rhythm in your design. When done right, the scaffolding of grids can remove the guess work from many aspects of your process. Different types of grids can also help you establish a rational approach to type scales, positioning, sizing and spacing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough these principles originated in the relatively \u0026#34;rigid\u0026#34; medium of print, I remain convinced now more than ever of their importance. In the era of screen design, grids can be instrumental in establishing consistency across a wide variety of device and viewport sizes, especially for teams that need to create a cohesive design experience for multiple products and platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite all the benefits of grid systems, for a long time I struggled to configure grids effectively in my own design process—they often didn\u0026#39;t provide me with the flexibility I wanted (in other design tools). So you can imagine my happiness when I discovered how \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/55-layout-grids\"\u003elayout grids\u003c/a\u003e worked in Figma. Figma offered added functionality like styles that removed much of the friction I had previously experienced. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Figma, you can apply more than one grid as a property to any frame (and independently toggle its visibility). That was a game changer, and quickly became an essential part of my workflow. In speaking with other Figma users, I learned that many still hadn\u0026#39;t had the lightbulb moment I did in uncovering the useful capabilities of this feature. So, I thought I\u0026#39;d share a few ways that I use layout grids to speed up my design process, from resizing frames to visualizing spacing and padding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsider this post a little \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo\"\u003egrid quo pro\u003c/a\u003e...in return, all I want is for you to spread the word to other Grid Newbies out there!

These appear as visual aids in your design spanning the width of your design and repeating vertically at an even internal. What that interval is, is largely dependent on your typography scales and line-heights. In many 8pt grid systems, a 4pt baseline is used. This basic unit makes the math easy and scalable as you start to setup different type sizes and line-height combinations. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing one can help you align one piece of type to another while giving you a unit of measure to help establish the sizing and spacing of other elements.

By using a row grid, with the type set to \u0026#34;Top\u0026#34;, we can create the foundation for a baseline grid. Usually it\u0026#39;s a good idea to set the row count to a high number that will allow you to accommodate longer scrolling frames. From there you can choose to highlight alternating rows, or thin lines using a combination of the height, gutter, and color properties as illustrated below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=476\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe grid settings above illustrate how you can take different approaches to styling a baseline grid.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"nested-grids\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#nested-grids\"\u003eNested grids\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that we\u0026#39;ve covered the basics, let\u0026#39;s take a look at how we can combine them, share them, and use them in a variety of ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"nested-grids\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#nested-grids\"\u003eNested grids\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike other tools, you won\u0026#39;t be limited to a single grid at the \u0026#34;artboard\u0026#34; level.

Yes, perhaps we could transition between comments mode or other modes more seamlessly, but those weren’t “pants on fire” problems as it were.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=350\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re considering scoping your own redesign project, it’s worth analyzing which path to take upfront. There are three options to consider:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eSurface:\u003c/em\u003e Focus on how things appear in the UI, such as input controls, icons, typography, button behavior, and so on.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eFoundation:\u003c/em\u003e Focus on how things fit together and the underlying mental model, like modality and information architecture.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eHybrid of surface and foundation:\u003c/em\u003e You could make both surface-level and structural changes, but only for part of the product (otherwise you’re doing it all).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Figma, we felt like we’d have a broader impact if the refresh touched the entire product, so we chose path #1 — focus on improving the UI surface.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo narrow our scope even more, we decided roughly how much time we wanted to spend on it. We were willing to devote 3 people full-time, from engineering, design and product management, for a 5-month span. That constraint helped us make a lot of choices upfront. Namely, we decided that this was not going to be a complete UI overhaul, but rather a \u003cem\u003evisual refresh\u003c/em\u003e. A fresh coat of paint or new furniture but no moving of walls.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, it was painful to make that call. As designers our job is to care about these things (and as designers crafting a tool for other designers, we \u003cem\u003eknow\u003c/em\u003e you notice all the details). But we ultimately couldn’t solve it all given our time constraints. This was, perhaps, the biggest lesson of the UI refresh: We had to be ok with letting go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLearn from our experience\u003c/em\u003e: When a group of designers starts talking about a wish list of UI changes, things can get out of control, fast. Unchecked tinkering can be a never-ending task, so one of the most crucial steps when you’re contemplating a redesign is to figure out how to scope it. Ask yourselves: \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eIf you only had one week to tackle this project, what would you fix?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAre your biggest issues on the surface, or are they built into the structure of your product?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow much time are you willing to spend on this?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"next-research-what-you-re-in-for\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#next-research-what-you-re-in-for\"\u003eNext, research what you’re in for\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we decided to stick with a surface level refresh of Figma, we spent the next couple weeks doing research to prepare. We assigned working groups of 3-4 people to tackle each of the main themes synthesized from the post-it note exercise:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eColor\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTypography and iconography\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpacing, grids and metrics\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe goal was to explore the ideas and directions possible in each category by studying how we do things currently in Figma and how other software handles similar challenges. Each group created a Figma file of findings, with their own proposal for changes. For example, the team working on color proposed that we increase the contrast or depth of “Figma blue” so it would be easier to read in combination with white.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey all kept in mind four main goals for the project:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eModernizing the UI.\u003c/em\u003e Times change and expectations change, that is simply a fact. What feels dated about our UI? How do we separate out trends from legitimate progression and improvements from what feels current and contemporary?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eLegibility \u0026amp; Accessibility.\u003c/em\u003e There are a lot of methods and philosophies for analyzing readability and contrast. We decided that what was most important was to pick one method for color contrast and be consistent, and we went with \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\"\u003eWCAG2\u003c/a\u003e. Typography was another topic in this category.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eSimplicity.\u003c/em\u003e As the product has gotten richer and more complex, it was time to look at how we could reduce the number of patterns in use. For example: Did we have the right kinds of user input controls? Did our UI labeling system allow expressing hierarchy in a clear and concise way? Did we have too much going on in the toolbar?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003eUsability.\u003c/em\u003e We wanted to focus on ease of use and understanding, so we looked at discoverability in the product. Could people find the components sidebar with just an icon in a corner? Is it easy and straight-forward to navigate between pages of a document?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was also an unmentioned goal: could we move cheese without people noticing in a negative way? If users couldn’t immediately say what changed, maybe that was a sign that we had pulled the visual refresh off well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"now-comes-the-real-work\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#now-comes-the-real-work\"\u003eNow comes the real work\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a few weeks, the teams got together again and presented their findings. We discussed proposed suggestions and agreed on the general changes we wanted to make (but didn’t determine prescriptive solutions). For example, we agreed: “This current Figma blue isn’t working,” but we didn’t decide what blue to use instead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we’d agreed on those high-level conclusions, we assigned one specific designer (me!) to champion the UI refresh project, and one front-end engineer to build it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was the right call to involve the whole design team in this early brainstorming and prioritization process. That way, everyone was bought into the decisions we implemented and had context on the changes coming down the pipeline.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe rest of the project proceeded how you might imagine.  Although only one designer was dedicated to it full-time, we did daily check-ins with the rest of the design team, plus more formal design crits three times a week. We talked about the work on an ongoing basis so no one was caught off guard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"living-with-your-decisions\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#living-with-your-decisions\"\u003eLiving with your decisions\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith a project like this, you have to live with your designs to know your decisions are right. So early on, we set a tight deadline to finish a smaller version of the refresh that we could test internally. (Figma relies on a private staging environment in our day-to-day work to help us catch bugs before we ship to the public.) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpecifically, we made typography, color and grid changes to the “base layer” of the UI in the editor — those are the parts which are always on screen, like the toolbar and properties sidebar. Once our engineers built it, we started using the changes internally to see what worked as expected and what...didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnother lesson\u003c/em\u003e: If you choose to dog-food your own redesign in stages, be prepared for things to get messy. For example, we would make a change to part of a toolbar but nothing else. Understandably, it would look frankensteined until we shipped other aspects of the refresh. We recommend you over-communicate to the rest of the company what they should expect via in-person meetings and Slack/email messages. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter making more progress throughout the product, we conducted several phases of user research to ensure our refresh didn’t cause any big problems or issues. We knew people wouldn’t be \u003cem\u003ethrilled\u003c/em\u003e with the shift — in many products, redesigns are often met with skepticism from the existing community. But we wanted to make sure we didn’t actively harm our users with the changes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere was a lot more to this project that I wish I could share with you, but it might take another 3,000 words to do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor now, we’ll leave you with the most important lesson of all. If you’re undergoing your own UI revamp, set up your project with a clear and doable scope...lest you toil forever in the land of the redesign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope you enjoy the updated face of Figma :–).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

It\u0026#39;s easy to fall into the \u0026#34;us vs. them\u0026#34; trap by constantly calling out \u0026#34;bad behavior\u0026#34;: \u003cem\u003eDon\u0026#39;t use blue. Don\u0026#39;t put that there. Make sure that works on mobile. Don\u0026#39;t write CSS like that. This form is not accessible. Why did you need a new component there?\u003c/em\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you\u0026#39;re not careful, this attitude can lead to a poisonous culture in your design org. \u003cbr/\u003eA design systems team needs to focus on more than just being right; they have to be helpful, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis lesson took me a painful amount of time to figure out. When I first started a design system project at Gusto I believed that tools or process improvements would solve our inconsistencies. We needed a UI Kit! We needed a Component Library! At least that\u0026#39;s what everyone talks about in blog posts and Medium articles; I thought that if I could just sit alone in a dark room then I could build our design system all by myself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it turns out a design system can\u0026#39;t be perfected in solitude because it\u0026#39;s rooted in human relationships. It serves as a mirror for the company, a reflection of the dynamics at play between designers, engineers, product managers and even customers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce I realized this, I knew we — on the design system team — needed a new approach to managing communication around and implemention of the system. We began to treat the design system as a cultural project instead of a technical one. We created a Slack-focused channel for feedback and questions, held office hours with the design systems team, and assembled an \u0026#34;Introduction to our UI\u0026#34; kit for newcomers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?rect=1,0,1998,1306\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=438\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThis is the introduction to our UI Kit in Figma for new employees and designers who want to learn more about what\u0026#39;s possible.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e These steps were helpful, but by far the effective approach to evangelizing the design system was through pairing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIdeally other designers at the company should feel like we\u0026#39;re placing rocket boosters on their designs, rather than shackling their creativity. But that\u0026#39;s only possible by working closely with them — sitting with them and getting to know them not only as designers but as people, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"pairing-is-user-research\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#pairing-is-user-research\"\u003ePairing is user research\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI treat pairing like user research. Working side-by-side with someone gives me a good idea of how they handle our design components and patterns, and what documentation is missing from our codebase and design files in Figma. I can see what parts of the design system are confusing for people, what\u0026#39;s weird and what\u0026#39;s working well. This information then helps us evolve componentry to meet their needs (instead of us assuming we know what those needs are).  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou have this wonderful opportunity to reset the social contract between you and the designer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile pairing, I\u0026#39;m confronted with questions like this:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDo our designers and engineers know about our component library? \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAre they familiar with the latest best practices around HTML and CSS?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCan my team do a better job explaining why using component X is beneficial to the organization as a whole? \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCan I steal this layout from the designer and make it an official pattern for everyone to adopt in the future?\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eOther design teams use office hours to answer questions like this, but when we started holding our own we found that they weren\u0026#39;t quite as popular as we\u0026#39;d hoped. Designers and engineers often don\u0026#39;t know when they need us, so they don\u0026#39;t come to our office hours proactively.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"pairing-turns-critique-into-collaboration\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#pairing-turns-critique-into-collaboration\"\u003ePairing turns critique into collaboration\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second benefit of pairing is that it opens communication between the design systems team and other people at the company. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I hinted at earlier, collaborating with the design systems team shouldn\u0026#39;t feel like another critique. Instead, it should feel like you\u0026#39;re moving 80 times faster and preventing a ton of future bugs and issues from popping up. A designer working with us should feel confident that their work is of going to be of a higher standard and quality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#39;s the dream at least. In reality, when a design systems team first forms everything is likely to be overly complex and undocumented. A lot of our codebase at Gusto is imprinted in our memory because we\u0026#39;ve spent years rummaging around trying to understand and refactor it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe codebase can and can\u0026#39;t do stuff, and those constraints aren\u0026#39;t always visible. Folks on the team might be unaware that there\u0026#39;s a limited set of colors to choose from, or that there\u0026#39;s a component that already exists that can solve this exact use case, or that we should avoid building \u003cem\u003ethis thing\u003c/em\u003e in \u003cem\u003ethis way\u003c/em\u003e because it violates our accessibility standards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eSide note: if the motto of improv is: \u0026#34;Yes, and…\u0026#34; then the motto of design systems is surely: \u0026#34;Yes, but…\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it can be dangerous to initiate all those rules and dump all that overhead on people. It can make you sound like an annoying control freak — engineers will begin to ignore your docs and designers will continue to go off into the wilderness and make interfaces that might not complement what already exists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePairing helps lessens that tension and animosity. During pairing sessions, the design system team can teach others the institutional knowledge we have stashed away in our noggins and prevent more information from being silo\u0026#39;d away into different teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt gives us this wonderful opportunity to reset the social contract between us and other designers. What feels like another round of burdensome design critique during office hours will often feel like a more collaborative, productive conversation whilst pairing.  It\u0026#39;s then suddenly possible to make significant improvements to the system without any of the silly drama.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd so we both win in this scenario! We both get work done much faster and in a more collaborative spirit — product designers will learn about our system of front-end components and patterns whilst we get a better understanding of what they need to do their job well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"pairing-creates-more-design-system-evangelists\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#pairing-creates-more-design-system-evangelists\"\u003ePairing creates more design system evangelists\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s one last big benefit worth mentioning about pairing: It creates more evangelists for the design system. Once a pairing session is over, the designer/engineer often passes those lessons on to the next person on their team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eA lot of folks won\u0026#39;t know when they need you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrading knowledge in this way is important because we desperately need someone on every team to act as a translator.

For Sarah Kuehnle, vice president of product at Dribbble, the goal was to make collaboration as easy as being in the same room together.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eDribbble is on a mission to build the world’s best platform for designers to gain inspiration, exposure, feedback, education, community, and job opportunities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eNavigating time zones and continents, the design team relied on a slew of tools to help keep them in sync. “We used video conferencing and a mishmash of collaboration tools to support our design process and try to enable collaboration,” she says. However, none of the tools  offered a seamless way of working together. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were other challenges as well. “We didn’t have insight into other designers’ work,” says Kuehnle. “Plus managing files and multiple streams of feedback took time away from actual design work.”     \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"making-long-distance-collaboration-a-team-sport\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#making-long-distance-collaboration-a-team-sport\"\u003eMaking long-distance collaboration a team sport\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a remote team, Dribbble’s designers are always looking for ways to optimize their workflow. When a new member introduced Figma to the design team, their curiosity was piqued. “Figma was immediately interesting to us because we could all jump in a file at the same time,” says Kuehnle. “We realized we could recreate the experience of working together in a meeting room, on a whiteboard, brainstorming designs and sharing comments in real time.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot only could Figma offer a way to easily share design files, but because it is online, it’s also easy to find current files without pinging multiple people or jumping in and out of various tools. “It’s great to stay heads down, in the file and ecosystem that I am creating in instead of incurring the productivity costs of switching from app to app,” says Rogie King, senior product designer at Dribbble.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKing also appreciates how Figma handles vectors and its simple approach to copy-paste attributes. “It’s amazing,” he says. “The way Figma treats images simply as a fill of an object is super brilliant.” Check out King’s \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/rogie/status/1085570340313432064\"\u003eTwitter thread\u003c/a\u003e on designing in Figma. “I want the team to use the tools they love, but they also need to be effective for us as a design team as well as for the larger organization,” says Noah Stokes, director of design at Dribbble. “Figma has the capability to replace multiple tools in one swoop, giving us a single place to have our versioned work where anyone on the team can leave feedback and review new work. It’s pretty revolutionary, in my opinion.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNaturally, some team members were hesitant about adopting a new tool and the effort required to get up to speed. The concerns went away once everyone realized that Figma made it easy to ingest other design file types to get started. “To ease the transition even more, we took our existing user interface and recreated it in Figma,” says Kuehnle. “That gave everyone familiar building blocks to work with.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e💡 \u003cstrong\u003eShare work to Dribbble directly from Figma\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eDribbble used Figma’s API to create an \u003ca href=\"https://dribbble.com/stories/2018/10/15/new-plugins-and-integrations\"\u003eintegration\u003c/a\u003e so you can send your work directly from Figma to Dribbble.

Multiplayer allows all the designers to jump into a single design file to share work. And because they are all working from the same file, the remote team can easily duplicate frames to brainstorm new ideas, make comments or implement changes all in real time.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis means that Dribbble designers can iterate on designs faster, solving problems in minutes compared to days. Kuehnle cites a recent example: “We wanted to add something new to a user profile and I already had a frame in Figma that I presented to the team on a video call,” says Kuehnle. “Five of us all jumped on the file, brainstormed solutions, critiqued each other’s ideas, and within 20 minutes we had a design that we all liked.

By clicking on his avatar in Figma, designers can follow along as he designs and learn new things by watching what he does. Sometimes, he puts a Figma link into a Slack channel and invites people to his file, giving them a way to learn through osmosis — a method not otherwise possible for a remote team. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?rect=1,0,3300,2620\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=532\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven the designers that use the Dribbble platform are collaborating and providing suggestions and feedback via Figma to the Dribbble team. “We redesigned the shot page a few months ago and immediately got intense feedback on it,” says Kuehnle. “Our users really care about Dribbble and several invested their own time in creating a Figma file with our new design and iterating on it.

Historically, I was taught to share designs when they’re done (or nearly there). Whether it\u0026#39;s a deliverable for a client, or something I want to get feedback on from a colleague, I would only pass it on when it was practically flawless.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s nothing inherently wrong with this (who doesn\u0026#39;t want to share their best work?), but if I\u0026#39;m being honest with myself this tendency was driven in large part by fear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI worried that I’d be judged by the neatness of the file, the pixel-perfection of the shapes, or the naming convention of the layer names, instead of the actual solution I presented. This fear was amplified in an open, collaborative environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat if they see I\u0026#39;m not using an 8px grid?What if they notice I haven\u0026#39;t named my layers?What if they see how I create my icons?What if...?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Figma, I would focus my energy and time on making sure the file was \u0026#34;presentable\u0026#34; rather than exploring solutions. If that sounds familiar to you, you’re not alone. Open design is still relatively new, so we\u0026#39;re all still figuring out the processes and techniques that work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver time I adapted, in large part by relying on one Figma feature: An unassuming icon in the File Browser called “\u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/19-file-browser\"\u003edrafts\u003c/a\u003e.” Drafts gave me a way to dip my toe in the pool of open design before jumping off the diving board. A lot of people don\u0026#39;t know much about our drafts feature or how to use it, so I thought I\u0026#39;d share a little more about my approach in the hopes that it helps others. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-what-and-why-of-figma-drafts\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-what-and-why-of-figma-drafts\"\u003eThe what and why of Figma Drafts\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may have noticed the “drafts” icon before, or even used it from time to time. We have very little documentation on it from a support perspective, and we rarely mention it in product launches, because truth be told, from a technical perspective, it\u0026#39;s the same as other organizational structures in Figma. Like teams and projects, it’s a place to hold files.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?rect=0,0,2559,1440\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=377\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut there’s one key difference — it’s your personal folder. Your drafts aren’t beholden to the \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/20-permissions\"\u003epermissions/share settings\u003c/a\u003e of the larger team or project you’re operating in (the way you are in the rest of Figma). In fact, you can’t grant global access to your drafts to anyone else — you can only choose to share an individual file (or not). It’s inherently your own space, to do with what you will.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAside from just making you more comfortable with open design, drafts can also help you move past your dreaded designer’s block. You may be full of caffeine, inspired, and want to put pen to paper...but where do you start? Do you first try and find colors or maybe typography? What about flow and organization?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNone of that matters in “drafts,” which are — by their very definition — not the polished final product. They’re a place for experimentation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a lot of power in language, and for me, the word “drafts” evokes a carefree psychological association. When I hear it, I don\u0026#39;t think of design systems, prototypes, colors, or grids. No, instead I imagine my notebook that sits next to my computer at my desk, packed with random ideas, sketches, and a few partially completed to-do lists. Some of the pages are full from top to bottom, while others have a single word or a little icon drawn on them. Some are neatly written in pen, while others are smeared with pencil markings and the faint remains of poorly erased ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;h=502\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA look into my notebook.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEarly on in my time at Figma, drafts became my digital notebook, my space to test things out.

At any point you can ungroup the elements, by pressing: \u003ccode\u003e⌘ + Shift + G\u003c/code\u003e (Mac) or \u003ccode\u003eCtrl + Shift G\u003c/code\u003e (Win).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGroups are really useful when you want to combine similar items together and manage less layers within your design. For example, you may have a selection of company logos that need to stay together. Grouping them is a great way to combine them into one single more manageable layer—clicking on any of the elements within your group will select the entire thing and allow you to move or manipulate it as a single object on the canvas. If you need to select a particular child element within a group, you can do so by double clicking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can also leverage features like \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-smart-selection/\"\u003eSmart Selections\u003c/a\u003e inside a group to adjust the spacing between elements. In the example below you can see the group\u0026#39;s bounds auto adjust to match the overall dimensions of the child elements when the spacing changes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you resize a group, its child elements will scale as you would expect vector artwork to scale. However effects, strokes, and type sizes will not scale. If you wish to scale these properties too, use the \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/35-scale-tool\"\u003escale tool\u003c/a\u003e (\u003ccode\u003eK\u003c/code\u003e).

She works with a designer collaboratively using Figma to brainstorm ideas, sketch ideas, and prototype solutions. “Working with designers collaboratively using Figma is easy and helpful because it’s not like a scary design tool where there are loads of things I don’t understand,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31b0722672c9f8af8889d58851b07a5e62e15702-677x902.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=893\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31b0722672c9f8af8889d58851b07a5e62e15702-677x902.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31b0722672c9f8af8889d58851b07a5e62e15702-677x902.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31b0722672c9f8af8889d58851b07a5e62e15702-677x902.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31b0722672c9f8af8889d58851b07a5e62e15702-677x902.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 677w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eImage from Bulb website: https://bulb.co.uk/service \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"bringing-collaborative-energy-to-creating-a\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#bringing-collaborative-energy-to-creating-a\"\u003eBringing collaborative energy to creating a design system\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the right tool in place, the team turned its attention to creating a design system for Bulb. “I wanted to establish a design system to achieve consistency by creating this one source of truth for design,” says Alla. “Figma’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgRUEyw9xpo\"\u003eteam library\u003c/a\u003e is very suited to working with a design system because if we change a master component, it will update across all of the designs.” The synchronization of styles and components across files - all accessed within the browser - provides this fast-paced team the perfect palette for the design system. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting with a screenshot of every page of each Bulb product, the team created a visual site map in Figma, which highlighted the breadth of inconsistencies and deviations across the different products. Forming a collaborative team for the project, the members began establishing \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/making-bulb/the-principles-behind-bulbs-design-8da5b07b5a06\"\u003edesign principles\u003c/a\u003e that were then used to guide the team when it started normalizing the components and systemizing design patterns. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Because there were, for example, many different versions of things like buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc., defining design principles allowed us to say, ‘Okay, so this one is simple and robust and this one isn’t,’ and gradually we created patterns and rolled them out across eight different products,” says Alla.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy advice for other companies that want to build a design system is to keep it very, very simple and start small. In Bulb’s design system, we have a very simple and small color palette and a small number of design patterns.

Patterns are the repeating, reusable parts of the interface, such as buttons, colors, typography and icons. Practices are how designers create, organize and share those patterns.\u003cbr/\u003e“Design practices are a cultural element of design systems,” says Alla. “They define how we work together, define new patterns, name them, decide whether a pattern is good enough to be part of the system, contribute new patterns to the design system, review them, and so on.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost of the design patterns in Solar are supported by user research. “We try to ground them in real context, with research insights kept alongside design patterns,” says Alla. “With Figma, it’s very easy for user researchers to add insights directly into design mock-ups so everyone can view the rationale that went into each project. No research insights are lost in the process.”  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe hallmark of Bulb’s design system is that it is purpose-built for collaboration. Everyone on the team has a space to contribute, and it’s not only for developers or designers. The systems  has a built-in process for submitting new patterns. Using a template form in Figma, users can input the suggested pattern details, any user research, design specifications, and so on. The submission then goes to the design architecture team, which  reviews it and ultimately decides if the pattern will be submitted to the system. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?rect=0,0,1920,1275\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=445\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eImage from Bulb\u0026#39;s Design Blog: https://bulb.co.uk/blog/introducing-bulbs-design-system  \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"accelerating-the-speed-of-design\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#accelerating-the-speed-of-design\"\u003eAccelerating the speed of design\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the Solar design system as the only source of truth for all design, designers and developers can work at a rapid pace. “We run a really fast design process here,” says Beth. “We’re constantly building things, testing them, iterating, and improving.

As our footprint has expanded across industries, we’ve developed our product to handle a broader scope of needs (like prototyping and code handoff). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/organization/\"\u003eFigma Organization\u003c/a\u003e, launching today, we’re unveiling our first enterprise-grade offering, with sophisticated controls and security features. To build it, we partnered with businesses of all types — from retail (Rakuten) to financial (Square) to automotive (Volvo) to tech (Uber). Based on their feedback, we built a new, more powerful version of Figma with everything corporate leadership might need (unified billing, audit reports and more), and a few extra features designers will love (Shared Fonts, unlimited teams and organization wide design systems). You can read \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/organization/\"\u003ethe full feature list here\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRead on for a deep dive on some of this new functionality, brought to life with anecdotes from our Beta partners. We hope they’ll provide workflow inspiration on what’s possible when your tool is on the web.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"unlimited-browsable-teams\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#unlimited-browsable-teams\"\u003eUnlimited, browsable teams\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Figma Organization, companies can build an integrated home for all their design activity. There’s no cap on the number of teams users can create or join, making it easy for everyone to view prototypes, export assets, copy code or just peek into what other teams are working on. Since Figma runs on the web, everything stays up to date. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Uber designer Femke van Schoonhoven put it: \u0026#34;Figma is like a tidy bookshelf, where you can find exactly what you need, whenever you need it.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat bird’s eye view is crucial for big organizations. For example, Volvo Cars has been around for 100 years and has to manage the design process for all the brands, teams and offices they’ve built in that time. “We needed a tool to help us centralize our files and work collaboratively at scale,\u0026#34; said Stanley Wood, Head of User Experience at Volvo Cars. \u0026#34;Figma enables us to do just that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this new tier of Figma, we’ve also expanded privacy options, giving admins more fine-grained control over who sees what. In addition to \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/article/20-permissions\"\u003ethe existing project and file permissions\u003c/a\u003e, they can now set entire teams to:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eOpen (anyone can join)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eClosed (anyone can view the team but must request access to join/edit projects)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSecret (no one can see the team unless they’re invited)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can structure teams in the way that makes the most sense for your organization. At Uber, for example, there’s many independent products all operating under the Uber umbrella, like Uber Freight and Uber Eats (in addition to Uber’s ride-sharing business). Previously, they had issues with fragmentation. Files didn’t have a consolidated home and lived in a lot of places —— hard-drives, cloud storage, third-party plugins. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We were looking for a way to get people in the right place at the right time — in the right team with the right assets,” said Jeff Jura, Staff Product Designer who focuses on Uber’s design systems. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter partnering with us on the Beta, Uber decided to migrate the whole company over. They now do 90% of their product design work — including the Rider and Driver apps — in Figma. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We embraced the organic nature of allowing teams to operate on their own, but still come out and see the global aspect,” said Jeff. “It spread like wildfire.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"organization-wide-design-systems\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#organization-wide-design-systems\"\u003eOrganization-wide design systems\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Dustin Tanner joined Square to build out the financial technology company’s primary design system, he had one request: Build the design system in Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I say all the time that Figma is the only design systems tool. It\u0026#39;s not hyperbole,” Dustin said. “Nothing else makes sense. It\u0026#39;s the only tool where you can do everything in one place and that centralization is critical.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma Organization expands on this design system functionality. For the first time, teams can share Component and Style libraries, so multiple services can use the same collection of assets. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis allowed Square to migrate the company to Figma, transitioning 100+ designers working on 25+ products. They now share and maintain 6 unique design systems spanning iOS, Android, and web in our tool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEveryone is automatically granted access to the component library for Square’s Point of Sale product. If a team working on a different product, like Square for Restaurants, has a particular design need — like creating a new customer profile — they can see how the Point of Sale product handles that situation by browsing its design system. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the sake of consistency, they can adapt the structure of the form while retaining their own personal branding. Because Figma’s on the web, the different assets will stay connected to each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Everyone\u0026#39;s looking at a single source of truth —— the exact same components that are the exact same version in the same tool. That\u0026#39;s what Figma does for a design system,” said Dustin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen designers need to add new Components or Styles or tweak existing ones, they can do that from their master design system file. They hit two buttons, and anyone who has used the Component in their own files is automatically notified. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat speed of execution is equally important to restaurant delivery company Deliveroo. “When we alter our master library, everything gets updated in one single swoop,” says Raphaël Guilleminot, Senior Design Manager Deliveroo. “It makes it a lot easier to change things at scale.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, let’s take a look at how Figma Organization alleviates administrative tedium. Things like Shared Fonts and Single Sign-on will make design op managers’ lives a lot easier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, Jeff at Uber doesn’t have to spend any time onboarding new hires to the design system. They can just log in with their work email, and they’ll have access to everything they need, including Uber icon libraries and components. They don’t have to download software or procure license codes or connect to cloud storage. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey’ll also have access to all of Uber’s fonts, because Figma Organization comes with a new Shared Fonts feature. Admins can preload brand fonts into the tool, so that everyone can access them without installing a font helper or figuring out where the font files live.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The designer can start designing immediately,” said Jeff. “The nature of Figma lets people get in, start asking questions, and feeling things out on their own.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Figma Organization, companies have total control over the security and visibility of things. If an employee leaves, they can be deactivated from Figma via their Single Sign-on. Contractors can be granted access to individual teams or projects. Admins can lock down files so anyone outside the organization will hit a 404 page if they type in a company URL.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith these new link access controls, people can share designs without worrying about a leak. That in turn facilitates more collaboration and feedback cycles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“After that first experience of sending a Figma URL out and seeing others immediately jump in the file, there really is no going back for our team,” said Bryan Haggerty, a Senior Design Manager at Twitter. “By next year I imagine most product design teams will have adopted Figma as their primary UI design tool.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"want-more-information\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#want-more-information\"\u003eWant more information?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you can’t tell from this article, we \u003cem\u003e really \u003c/em\u003e believe in the power of web-based design. We’ve seen first hand how it transforms the design process for teams of all shapes and sizes. A big thanks to all of our enthusiastic beta partners who provided great feedback to get us to today —— it’s been five months of working together to produce this enterprise-ready product. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a lot more features to Figma Organization than just those highlighted here, so check out \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/organization/\"\u003ethis information page\u003c/a\u003e for more details.

This is a group of people who are doing great work together, but you’re going to add more engineers and people will grow and change. Without falling into the “monoculture” failure mode — where you only hire people exactly like yourselves, and where difference is ostracized rather than celebrated — how do you ensure you maintain the important parts of how you work together?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis was exactly the question \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/files/recent\"\u003eFigma\u003c/a\u003e faced, and as a solution, we decided to codify our engineering values — how we build products and how we work together. The entire team came together to discuss topics ranging from specific behaviors and individual priorities to team traditions and processes, and even the company’s competitive advantages and our hopes for the future of Figma itself. The result was the following four values, each attempting to encapsulate an important aspect of how we work together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe strove for values that were descriptive, not aspirational; we “shipped” these believing that as a team we already fully embodied them. Thus these values can be used as a yardstick to make decisions with and a guide for how we want to grow, rather than a forcing function to change ourselves. Additionally, implicit in each value is a tradeoff — something that we give up. For each of these values, you could imagine a hypothetical tech company valuing the opposite. A generic value like “write good code” or “try your best” does no good, because nobody would ever seriously espouse the opposite.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re sharing these values as a resource for those who might be interested in joining us someday and an example for folks putting together their own team values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"communicate-early-and-often\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#communicate-early-and-often\"\u003eCommunicate early and often\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDon’t wait until code review to share your direction; solving something together is better than solving it independently; assume best intentions when receiving feedback.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e981675a5430436e721566d5d33b4a53e61b734-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e981675a5430436e721566d5d33b4a53e61b734-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e981675a5430436e721566d5d33b4a53e61b734-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e981675a5430436e721566d5d33b4a53e61b734-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e981675a5430436e721566d5d33b4a53e61b734-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 799w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma is, above everything, a collaboration tool. This collaboration-first attitude is reflected in the way we build software (and of course, our engineering team are extremely active Figma users 🙂). The archetype of the cloistered genius can be tempting — we all want to be the solo rockstar engineer who goes heads down and emerges days later with a perfect solution metaphorically chiseled from stone. But at Figma, we’ve built an engineering team with huge depth and breadth of knowledge. We don’t want to throw that expertise away — hence our first value, communicate early and often.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCommunicating early and often ensures that work isn’t done in a vacuum. By sharing design documents, product specs, or even rough architecture drawings (usually in — you guessed it — Figma), we ensure that ideas are vetted early and issues can be spotted and resolved before we invest too much time in solutions that aren’t right. By normalizing enthusiastic sharing of works-in-progress, we make it easier for people to ask for help and input when they’re unsure how to approach a problem, as well as create opportunities for organic teaching and learning — for the benefit of the person sharing as well as the people being shared with. There undeniably exist projects and engineers where the heads-down approach could work; but the global maximum comes from ensuring communication happens every step of the way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t to say we’re dogmatic about communication process. Sometimes code is the easiest and most effective way to communicate or discuss an idea. And of course when fixing a bug or throwing together a quick, obvious change, we don’t invest the time in multiple rounds of communication beforehand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, communicating early and often only works if we’re serious about being receptive to input. So along with sharing works-in-progress, we work to listen to all the feedback that the act of sharing generates. This can be difficult — we’ve all had the challenging experience of sharing a deeply held opinion about how to approach a problem, only to discover that others disagree — but by ensuring that we’re sharing early, we minimize the cost of shifting direction. More later on how our values encourage us to think about feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy living this value, we trade off the risk of slowed decision-making due to a large number of voices in the room. It is not always easy for a large group of people to discuss and have equal say in making decisions. This value pushes us to not only communicate as broadly as possible but also to take all feedback seriously, which can lead us to spend many cycles iterating on communication and ensuring every voice is heard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"lift-your-team\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#lift-your-team\"\u003eLift your team\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHelp others grow; strive to make people feel better, not worse; strive to create an inclusive culture supporting diverse opinions; be solution oriented.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c8b43f359f1c05c3f5a86186f13028e545fa188-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c8b43f359f1c05c3f5a86186f13028e545fa188-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c8b43f359f1c05c3f5a86186f13028e545fa188-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c8b43f359f1c05c3f5a86186f13028e545fa188-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c8b43f359f1c05c3f5a86186f13028e545fa188-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 799w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eSoftware engineering is not a single player activity. At Figma, we’ve been fortunate to build a culture based on strong, respectful, positive relationships and early values discussions focused on how we build and maintain those relationships. Key to that theme was the idea of lifting each other up and working to make each other better, however we can. Lifting your team means prioritizing each other’s success and happiness over other considerations, and it’s our second engineering value. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore than the other values, the wording here is nuanced; it’s not “lift your company.” Engineering is a long process that must be sustainable and asking an engineering team to think of the company before themselves can lead to burnout. Instead, lifting your team is about your fellow engineers -- making sure that you’re trying not only to be successful yourself, but that you’re lifting the people around you as you do so.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis can mean many things, and play out in many ways. Most straightforwardly, it means an atmosphere of constant learning, mentorship and growth. Weekly tech talks, formal on-boarding mentorship and even simple encouragement to learn new skills have been a staple of Figma’s engineering team for as long as anyone can remember.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it also governs how we interact with each other on a more basic level. As a result of our emphasis on communicating early and often, we frequently find ourselves in the position of giving feedback to each other. This value describes norms that ensure feedback is thoughtfully delivered and focuses on ideas, not people; feedback that insults someone, belittles their work, or talks down is not effective feedback at all. Similarly, receptiveness to feedback -- taking ideas seriously, no matter who they come from, and working to make sure everyone has equal opportunity to participate in conversations -- means that we get the best outcomes (in addition to making sure that everyone is welcome in our engineering team).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnsuring that everyone, no matter their identity or background, is welcome at our company requires institutional investment, not just individual commitment. We hold company-wide initiatives like bias trainings and try to systemically adopt learnings from them into our processes. We have a recurring reading group focused on topics of identity, inclusion and psychological safety; two recent readings have been \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073P53DVL/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;btkr=1\"\u003eIjeoma Oluo’s So You Want To Talk About Race\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XJZ2BM3/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026amp;btkr=1\"\u003eEllen Pao’s Reset\u003c/a\u003e. These are spearheaded by our DE\u0026amp;I (“Diversity, Equity and Inclusion”) sub-committee focused on inclusion internally at Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis value also plays out in our retrospective, learning-from-mistakes mode. Especially when examining a problem - a project that came in late, an outage, a serious bug - it’s easy and sometimes cathartic to fall into finger-pointing mode. But this is damaging no matter where the fingers are pointed. Blaming a team member for a bug makes them feel bad, and makes them less likely to try to build things in the future; blaming someone not in the room (or at the company) makes everyone wonder how they’re talked about when they’re absent; blaming yourself makes your team feel like they should do the same to themselves when they make mistakes. But by removing finger-pointing from the picture, and talking about the problem only in terms of solutions - how do we fix the issue going forward, how do we prevent this from happening again - we can drive effective learning without making people feel worse.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat we trade off by living this value is having to constantly work to ensure we’re not becoming conflict-averse. Taken to its extreme, this value could lead to a group of people who are afraid to disagree with each other on anything. Some engineering cultures, concerned about this failure mode, attempt to drive in the opposite direction by encouraging head-to-head confrontation.

This is exciting to be a part of, but more than anything for the engineering team it’s a responsibility. Any bug — any outage — is something that may stand firmly in the way of a user getting their job done, and we want to live up to the trust that our users put in us and do our absolute best to ensure they stay productive. Living up to that trust is the heart of our third value, craftsmanship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCraftsmanship is about thoughtfulness and care in the work we do. It means being deliberate about what we build and how possible it will be to maintain and extend in the future. A solution that will require revisiting in a month -- because it’s not scaling, because it has a ton of bugs, because it doesn’t support all the use cases it needs to -- is not useful to us and ultimately will generate pain for our users. For a deep example of craftsmanship playing out in our product development process, look no further than the story of the exploration that went into building the \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/desperately-seeking-squircles/\"\u003eSquircles feature\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt also means learning from past mistakes to avoid making them in the future. We do retrospectives for every project, to ensure we’re constantly looking for opportunities to improve (even from projects that went smoothly) and so we can identify and consciously propagate those things that went well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis isn’t to say we’re perfectionists; some projects, like a beta version of a feature we expect to change heavily before releasing to the public at large, can be “sustainable” even with clear imperfection as long as it doesn’t get in the way of what we’re trying to learn from the beta. And even for final products, endless polish is as unsustainable as none. But this value pushes us to plan thoughtfully and ensure we learn from our mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat we trade off by living this value is (sometimes) day-to-day speed. It’s easy to imagine an engineering team that emphasizes moving fast over keeping things stable and bug-free — like a team building a product that isn’t responsible for important user data and doesn’t support anyone’s livelihood. But given the role the Figma product plays in the lives of our users, we feel it’s worth it to ensure we hold a high quality bar for them. And in the long run, being thoughtful about how we build often reduces the complexity of ongoing development and new features regardless.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"prioritize-impact\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#prioritize-impact\"\u003ePrioritize impact\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWe can only solve so many problems at once, so pick your battles; things are built with a shelf-life in mind and that’s ok.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8637f7fd50d3cef5fef20a52e01fe742c2d97c7-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8637f7fd50d3cef5fef20a52e01fe742c2d97c7-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8637f7fd50d3cef5fef20a52e01fe742c2d97c7-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8637f7fd50d3cef5fef20a52e01fe742c2d97c7-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8637f7fd50d3cef5fef20a52e01fe742c2d97c7-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 799w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s well believed on the Figma team that design tooling will never be “solved”; the space of interesting problems to solve is gigantic (as a quick perusal of the “Feature Requests” section in the \u003ca href=\"https://spectrum.chat/figma/feature-requests\"\u003eFigma Spectrum community\u003c/a\u003e will attest). Furthermore, we’re a small team, competing with companies staffed with orders of magnitude more employees than us. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat do we do first? Our final value, prioritize impact, reflects our drive as a team to focus on the things that matter the most to our users (current and future) above all else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrioritizing impact is something that just about every tech company will do - it’s hard to find a company (outside of perhaps research divisions) that decides to work on projects with no regard to what impact they’ll have. But it’s something we do with rigorous specificity. How much will this feature matters to users, and how many of them? If we think past our users of today to where we want to see the Figma product grow tomorrow, next month, or next year, will those users’ needs be met? We tend to rely on concrete data — e.g., the number of users hitting a specific bug or requesting a feature — but also on qualitative questions like impact on user experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith an engineering team that comfortably fits around a table and all know each others’ names and faces, we don’t have the bandwidth to spare on projects that aren’t the most important thing to be doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePrioritizing impact doesn’t just inform how we pick between projects, but also how we approach them. Our third value, craftsmanship, reflects our drive to be thoughtful and sustainable in how we build. But prioritizing impact ensures that we don’t go too far — that is, we don’t over-engineer in the name of sustainability. A solution that will last a year, and be built in a week, is often better than a solution that will last three years and be built in a month. For an example, our multiplayer feature that allows concurrent viewing and editing of a design file by multiple users was unveiled in \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/multiplayer-editing-in-figma/\"\u003eSeptember 2016\u003c/a\u003e; a year and a half later, we rebuilt the server that powered it from the bottom up using a more \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/\"\u003escalable technology stack\u003c/a\u003e. While we could have aimed for that level of scalability from the beginning, thoughtfully postponing that work allowed us to focus attention on other features in the intervening time and wait to see how necessary that work truly was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs with all values, there’s trade offs. Sometimes, we have to pass over the more out there and exciting projects, which can be undeniably frustrating. It is probably not an exaggeration to say that every engineer has half-a-dozen project ideas in their back pockets they’d love to work on — this is what made our Maker Week this past summer so fruitful! This value lets us explicitly admit that sometimes the most exciting projects aren’t the most important right now and gives us a framework to decide when a moonshot is worth tackling.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"epilogue\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#epilogue\"\u003eEpilogue\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eValues aren’t something that a team can simply write down once and call “done”; they’re meant to be the starting point of an ongoing conversation about how they want to work together.

Just as the Internet revolutionized the distribution of information in the 90s, cryptocurrency is revolutionizing the modern financial system - one Bitcoin at a time. While this new and decentralized system may be intimidating to some, many believe an open financial system can spark economic growth, unlock a new wave of innovation and empower billions of people. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the global financial market takes shape, one company is at the center - Coinbase. With more than 20 Million users worldwide, Coinbase makes it easy for anyone to buy, sell, and manage digital currency. Products like Coinbase Consumer and Wallet have been able to bring crypto mainstream by abstracting away the complexities of blockchain and making exchange easy for new users… and that all starts with good design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"open-financial-system-open-design\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#open-financial-system-open-design\"\u003eOpen Financial System → Open Design\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Coinbase mission is to create an open financial system for the world. To deliver on this vision, the design team has four guiding principles: to guide, empower, humanize and simplify. For Connie Yang, director of design, these principals help tackle the basic challenges when designing for crypto. She explains in her recent blog post, \u003ca href=\"https://blog.coinbase.com/why-design-is-the-killer-app-for-crypto-dcb00d2b1fa6\"\u003eWhy Design is the Killer App for Crypto\u003c/a\u003e, “alongside all the brilliant protocol developers, investors, and entrepreneurs — we need more people thinking about guidance, education, and use cases — people who can make technical ideas accessible to all.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust as openness and transparency are inherent pillars in the space, the same can be applied to design. For Yang’s team, design is open. It is a collaborative, iterative process. It is not exclusive to designers but inclusive of all roles. Anyone can participate and they are encouraged to do so. But it wasn’t always that way… at least in practice. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike many design teams, the siloed nature of tools restricted the Coinbase designers to fully embrace the concept of open design. To compensate, their tech stack and workflows grew exponentially. With one tool for designing, a different tool for prototyping and yet another tool for handing off to engineers, it became overwhelming. Context switching across platforms became a challenge and versioning issues became a nightmare. But when Zach Krassner, senior designer, introduced the team to Figma, things began to shift.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was the easiest roll out I’ve ever had because all I had to do was send out a link - it was amazing!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Krassner, because Figma is browser-based, everything is available online and multiple people can design together in one space, “it was like a designer’s dream,” he says. Finally, the team had a space where they could design in the open, solicit feedback and iterate together. Krassner explains, “When all types of people can come together, put their thoughts into a product and you can collect it all in one place rather than switching between a bunch of different places, that is real value.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"rocking-out-with-together\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#rocking-out-with-together\"\u003eRocking out with together\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCentralized on a single design tool, the team hit their groove - literally. Because files can be centrally stored and are accessible to all, designers, product managers, engineers and even leadership can stay up to date and have input on any given asset. As Yang explains it, “we weren’t designing behind a black box anymore.” As a result, the team could move faster. Yitong Zhang, product designer, explains, “We now have a really tight communication loop between stakeholders - there\u0026#39;s no bureaucracy around it, everybody gets their opinion heard and it’s tracked in Figma.” And Michelle Haydu, growth designer, agrees, “things now feel a lot crisper.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, designers, PMs, engineers can all speak in the same language, in the same location... in Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut the real music is made during the design team’s jam sessions. Yes, it is just as it sounds. Anytime the team gets an ad hoc request like new swag designs, posters, etc. the team huddles in their Design Lounge, opens a new Figma file and they rock ‘n’ roll. Yang explains, “We can all come together to creatively collaborate on something fun. It’s magical - that could never happen before.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-brighter-future-for-all\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-brighter-future-for-all\"\u003eA brighter future for all\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday the team is faster, more nimble and aligned. “Figma creates a new level of collaboration that never really existed before in design,” says Yang. The team is able to work together and ship products faster. But this is just the beginning - a culture is a living and breathing thing. As Nina Samarguliani, design manager, puts it, “we need to continue to foster an inclusive and diverse culture and put in place the right tools that empower designers to do their best work, not complicate it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePssst, Coinbase is \u003ca href=\"https://www.coinbase.com/careers\"\u003ehiring\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

Quantrill agrees. “It’s massively demystified the way that design works, so people can see how we work and think,” she says. “Being able to work collaboratively on one document means that product designers, researchers, engineers, and product managers can all see the process of content design.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe open, collaborative culture extends beyond the design team. “We can get input from people around the business who were maybe a bit nervous about doing that before,” says Quantrill. “Figma is much more accessible to people who aren’t design focused or working in the design field.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnboarding new designers is easier as well. “Because we’ve grown so fast over the last 11 months, and because content designers work with so many different stakeholders, one of the things we’re often required to do is to learn a lot of different tools,” says Quantrill. “It’s a lot easier when somebody joins the team now.

This applies to both soft skills and hard skills — for example, if you think good designers are assertive, you may look for it even if you agreed as a team it wasn’t important for the role.

One trick that helped us a lot was working closely with our amazing recruiter, Korin, by embedding her into the design team, joining our critiques and team meetings so she could help us hire the right talent and speak to what we do day-to-day more accurately with first-hand experience.

After poring over 1300 pages of documentation and scrutinizing existing libraries, we discovered existing tools forced us to make unacceptable compromises. So we decided to build our own PDF library from scratch. This gave us the control and precision necessary to meet the standards we strive to maintain for our users.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a format, PDF is different from PNG because it contains a detailed description of your designs, not merely an image of them. This is how PDF text and drawings can look crisp at any zoom level - it’s fundamentally a vector format, like SVG, but much more complex. However, PDF descriptions can be hard to wrangle and optimize. Since PDF can contain embedded images alongside vector representations, this gives engineers an easy way out when things get difficult. It’s always possible to give up and rasterize on a complex effect or gradient and put in a picture of it rather than describing it precisely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s exactly this compromise, to rasterize or to fight on, that we needed total control over in order to make our exporter really shine. This is especially critical for print applications when the output medium is large, or for digital applications where a variety of sizes of the same asset need to be generated. If we let some big, unsightly pixels show on your perfectly tuned work, we’d be letting you down, and we love you too much to do that!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"feature-highlights\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#feature-highlights\"\u003eFeature highlights\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the foundational library in place, we met the challenge of representing complex design elements like shadows, blurs and gradients head on. But this is where PDF’s ambitious scope becomes a liability - no viewer supports the format completely. This is especially the case when using PDF’s sophisticated shading techniques. These attributes produce a minefield of bugs in viewers which we had to navigate. Here’s how we ensure your work comes out unscathed in the export process:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"shadows\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#shadows\"\u003eShadows\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eDrop shadows can be tricky to make look crisp and clean. The concept is simple enough: just make a stencil of the shape, fill it in and smudge out the edges. Inner shadows are sort of the inverse of this, but still very similar. This is straightforward to accomplish at the shader level in a graphics pipeline, but PDF doesn’t provide us with that level of control. So we have to synthesize the result in code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo deliver high quality here, we finely rasterize the blurry parts region itself and make a soft mask out of it, allowing forms behind the shadow to remain sharp. We also take care to accurately clip the shadow or blur with vector methods where the blurred node’s boundary truncates the blur. This means that cracks will never appear between a blur and its parent path.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e51444a8d72bda71b17f8b366c2ec01c1111ed05-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e51444a8d72bda71b17f8b366c2ec01c1111ed05-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e51444a8d72bda71b17f8b366c2ec01c1111ed05-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e51444a8d72bda71b17f8b366c2ec01c1111ed05-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e51444a8d72bda71b17f8b366c2ec01c1111ed05-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 799w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"gradients\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#gradients\"\u003eGradients\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eCommon gradients like the linear and elliptical types are relatively straightforward to make in PDF.

And because designers often need to experience these interactive flows for activities like user testing, they create prototypes to bring their designs alive. But the process of creating prototypes is often repetitive, time consuming and downright painful — especially when designers want to show content on top of other content to mimic elements like sidebars, modals and popovers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday we are happy to announce that prototyping just got a whole lot more fun in Figma! With Figma’s new Overlays feature you can now show content flexibly on top of other content, interact with it and even open multiple overlays. Read on to learn how Overlays in Figma works…\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"how-it-works\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how-it-works\"\u003eHow it works\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"simple-overlays\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#simple-overlays\"\u003eSimple Overlays\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe reimagined the basic delivery of overlays. Now after you add a prototype link to connect two frames, you will see a new option in the property panel. This option will allow you to set the destination frame as an overlay. Once selected, you can customize where the overlay is placed and how it should appear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur relative positioning supports use cases like modals and action sheets where you want to show the overlay in relation to the device. For other other use cases like tooltips and dropdowns, you can manually position it in relation to the object from which it is being opened. \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"multiple-overlays\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#multiple-overlays\"\u003eMultiple Overlays\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut we didn’t stop there. In our increasingly interactive world, there are often situations where more than 2 overlays need to work together - think multi-step purchase flows and confirmation dialogues. We’re excited that now in Figma, designers can add multiple overlays on top of one another. And, best of all, setting up multiple overlays is just as simple as setting up a single overlay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"interactions-on-overlays\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#interactions-on-overlays\"\u003eInteractions on Overlays\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause prototypes are interactive experiences, we thought carefully about how to allow interactions on overlays.

You could easily look at what others were doing and play off that idea.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLan recalls that even the non-designers very quickly started moving elements around, changing messages, “borrowing” design elements from others, and more. “There was almost no learning curve” says Lan. “Anyone can jump in and start collaborating.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesign is a team sport, brainstorming with others in Figma stimulates so much more creativity because you can proactively and simultaneously build ideas with other collaborators.

      "content_html": "\u003cdiv id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesigners are constantly on the search for the perfect workflow, so they can spend less time organizing and more time designing. Alas, there’s no one path to design-lightenment. Every company, team and individual has unique needs, which is why we made Figma as flexible as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe introduced Pages last year to add to that adaptability. With Pages, you can subdivide your design file into separate tabs on the left hand side, to organize your work in the way that makes most sense for you, whether you’re building a design system, making an app or freelancing for others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a lot of different ways to set up your files, so we asked people to share their own approach. Take a look for some process inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_1-platform-or-screen-size\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_1-platform-or-screen-size\"\u003e1. Platform or screen size\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re working on a product that’s cross-platform or responsive — i.e. it’s an Android, iOS and Desktop app — use Pages to separate your designs. That way, you can build your designs responsively using Figma’s frame presets and constraints. Each Page holds its own prototype, which makes it easy to run user tests for different platforms or screen sizes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_2-by-feature-in-the-app\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_2-by-feature-in-the-app\"\u003e2. By feature in the app\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re working on a team with multiple designers and building an app with a lot of features, organize the sections of the product by Pages. That will allow you to work independently on a feature while still referencing the project as a whole. For example, one designer building the profile view of an app can easily check on what’s happening with the home screen design to stay consistent. You can test the flow for unique parts of the app by making a different prototype on each Page.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_3-stage-of-the-design-process\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_3-stage-of-the-design-process\"\u003e3. Stage of the design process\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you organize your Pages based on stage of the design process, other stakeholders can see how the work is progressing. Put finished designs on a Page labelled “Done,” and developers will know what they should be building (versus what you’re still tweaking). Stick early ideations and brainstorms on a different Page, so your polished work stays clean.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome possible Page structures:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThumbnail, wireframes, designs, archive — from \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/cameronmcnab/status/1055936055063412736\"\u003eCameron McNab\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDocs (reference materials, journey maps, other research), staging (where the messy work is done) and ready for review — from \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/McveyNick/status/1055925897650331648\"\u003eNick McVey\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSitemap, wireframes, mockups, QA, screenshots for marketing — from \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/robsonm_design/status/1055922966330957824\"\u003eMichael Robson\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eOr, go for pure simplicity:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_4-atomic-design-method\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_4-atomic-design-method\"\u003e4.

That simplifies your layer panel. For example, you won’t need to name each individual component or instance “button-selected” or “button-hovered,” you can just name it “selected” or “hovered.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_5-the-kitchen-sink-approach\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_5-the-kitchen-sink-approach\"\u003e5.

There’s no need to create a bunch of new Styles every time you change a link color or some other attribute — just update the original attribute and it will propagate through the system. As you’d imagine, this saves a ton of time and makes it easier for big organizations to scale their design systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFun fact — 42% of active designers now use Styles each week.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"sweating-the-small-stuff\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#sweating-the-small-stuff\"\u003eSweating the small stuff\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough Platform, Styles and Prototyping were the big headlines for Figma in 2018, we sweated the small stuff too.

As many of you know, nested instance swapping is crucial for systematic design. By replacing an instance that’s nested inside a component with an alternate instance, designers can customize parts of their work. For example, a designer might use instance swapping to show different states of a button after a user interaction (hovering versus clicking) without detaching that button component from the larger design system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith advanced project permissions, organizations have finer grained control over file sharing in Figma. Designers can designate a file “view only” or “invite only.” That’s a boon for people building design systems for their companies, because they can block others from changing master components while still letting them see the file and use its components in their own designs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"expansion-of-support\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#expansion-of-support\"\u003eExpansion of support\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe see customer support as a key part of the Figma experience, so we grew our support team from 3 to 7 this year and we’re still growing.

She joined a team of product managers, designers, product operations, data scientists and engineers — all focused on continuing to invent and iterate features and user experiences that bring cash as a form of payment to more markets around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Cash team was using a design tool that was not well suited for the project, which meant that the typical design workflow involved inefficient import and export of files and communication outside of the tool for status updates. To finish a single design, Van Schoonhoven had to work in several different tools for designing, prototyping, sharing, and collecting feedback before handing off to engineering.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe team hit its design software breaking point during a frustrating research trip.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We were testing prototypes with Uber drivers and the plan was to iterate in real time based on their immediate feedback,” says van Schoonhoven. “It was so painful to do this because we could only have one person at a time make changes to the file while the other had to wait. There was no way to work collaboratively on the same design at the same time. We thought ‘there must be a better way.’”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"collaborating-on-any-design-anywhere-anytime\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#collaborating-on-any-design-anywhere-anytime\"\u003eCollaborating on any design, anywhere, anytime\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBack in Amsterdam, van Schoonhoven was determined to find a solution to the collaboration problem. She heard that other teams within Uber were early adopters of Figma, a collaborative, web-based design tool, and decided to try it out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy simply dragging and dropping existing design files into Figma, van Schoonhoven was soon working in the new software, enhancing and creating designs using local languages and actual, in-context material. “The transition was extremely seamless,” says van Schoonhoven.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow nearly everything van Schoonhoven does is in Figma. She can collaborate in real time on the same design with other team members, locally or anywhere in the world. And she finds organizing files in Figma more intuitive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma is like a tidy bookshelf, where you can find exactly what you need, whenever you need it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePrototype for Uber India\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"cutting-through-the-noise-with-a-single-source-of\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#cutting-through-the-noise-with-a-single-source-of\"\u003eCutting through the noise with a single source of truth\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEasy collaboration and organization aren’t the only benefits van Schoonhoven appreciates. She reports that communication is much more efficient with Figma because it can take place directly within a design file.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Before, I would constantly be sending emails to project stakeholders with updates about the latest version of the design,” she says. “With Figma, my team members can go into the folder any time they want and see the latest designs. No one has to ping me about the latest status or go back-and-forth with me via emails to clarify which design is the latest version. Figma has reduced communication overhead by at least 75 percent.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps most impactful is the collaboration with engineers. “Making sure engineers had the latest design was a real struggle before,” says van Schoonhoven. “Now engineers are invited to the file in Figma so they can see the latest changes with comments in context.” Because van Schoonhoven can bring engineers into the design process early, handoff is simpler and faster.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHer favorite thing about Figma? It makes her feel like part of the team, even though the group is large and distributed across multiple locations. “Our work was very siloed before,” she says. “Figma is now our central design depository, which lets us all work together on a common goal. It’s had the biggest impact on my work.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Because Figma is web-based, it’s easy for stakeholders to share files and quickly get buyoffs on designs at the next level — and that means we can move faster as a team.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePrototype for Uber India\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"starting-new-collaborative-projects-in-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#starting-new-collaborative-projects-in-figma\"\u003eStarting new collaborative projects in Figma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Cash team strives to be involved as much as possible in the new work that comes from Uber headquarters.

Yes, we know, you’re \u003cem\u003ereally excited\u003c/em\u003e. We are too — we’ve admired Principle since it first launched in 2015.

Add scrolling to your pages or swiping between image cards. Give buttons different states based on how people interact with them. Play with animation between objects like spring, ease in, ease out or linear transitions. In short, add all the functionality to make your static designs feel like an actual mobile app.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ll soon see why Principle inspires fanatic obsession in its users.

Enable the Figma-Principle integration by opening Principle, clicking import and authorizing Figma as a source.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you need to tweak your Figma design after you already imported it to Principle, it’s easy to sync between the two tools. Principle will automatically recognize changes you make in Figma and merge them. Make a button bigger in Figma? The button will automatically resize in Principle, while keeping the same animations you originally set for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe integration was built using Figma’s web-based API, and Daniel spent a lot of time exploring our documentation and tools there. “The API explorer on the developer page is really useful,” Daniel said. “It’s a convenient way to get a handle on how it works.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the API Explorer, developers can put in the ID of a specific Figma file to see how the API will ultimately call it.

In a matter of weeks, the center of gravity for 3D UX design shifted to mobile.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the first time, anyone familiar with mobile app development could build immersive 3D experiences, with the potential to reach half a billion Android and iOS users (instead of just a small pool of VR headset owners). These platforms — ARCore from Google and ARKit from Apple — democratized 3D design for the masses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut enthusiasm quickly gave way to more practical concerns:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat tools and documentation were available to facilitate the embrace of 3D?\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow could mobile app designers and developers, accustomed to mature tools that formed (mostly) integrated workflows, begin to design for 3D? Not only did they need to learn the important \u003ca href=\"https://www.torch.app/blog/a-3d-primer-for-screen-designers\"\u003edifferences between designing for 2D and 3D\u003c/a\u003e, but they also had to wade through the hodgepodge of tools and \u003ca href=\"https://www.torch.app/pain\"\u003ebyzantine workflows\u003c/a\u003e borrowed from gaming, video/film entertainment, architecture and engineering disciplines.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo answer designers’ first concern, both Apple and Google quickly released augmented reality design guidelines. Apple’s guidelines are the more modest of the two in terms of both content and ambition. These appear under the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/augmented-reality/\"\u003eAugmented Reality entry\u003c/a\u003e in their Human Interface Guidelines. Google’s Augmented Reality Design Guidelines (GARDG) caught our attention for its greater breadth of topics, which seem to draw from their inspiration from Google’s real-life experience designing and building apps like \u003ca href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.vr.apps.ornament\u0026amp;hl=en_US\"\u003eAR Stickers\u003c/a\u003e and Just a Line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut both guidelines ultimately fall short when confronting the complexity and ambition expressed by many designers. Apple and Google limit their focus to simple, single scene applications and make no allowance for complex mechanics — or really anything behind simple object placement and sticker-like functionality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis doesn’t meet the needs of anyone building apps that include interactivity like:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eObject selection\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eConditional behaviors\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBranching scene flows or storyboards driven off of user behavior\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMovement between scenes using teleportation\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePortals\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePhysical gestures\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eBoth sets of guidelines lack any mention of multi-scene use cases, which automatically excludes many modes of interactivity or conditional behavior that leads to transitions, complex or more interesting changes of state, personalization, and ultimately a deeper, more immersive experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, there is no discussion of animations (a common topic in our interviews with designers), either triggered or timed, or the notion of a shared or collaborative environment. The latter example is one we frequently encounter. Designers want to allow remote collaborators and clients to see their AR prototypes in the environment for which they were intended, and to provide feedback, all in real time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven in the relatively tame realm of static object creation and placement, designers are already searching for the best way to design for complex behaviors, such as selecting objects that might be hidden by other objects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat said, when it comes to object placement (the most basic interaction in AR), the Google guidelines make assumptions about optimal object placement range — within the reach of the user — that we see no reason to codify at this time. What about throwing objects as a method of placement, or pointing, grabbing and interacting with objects at a distance?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, compared to Apple’s guidelines, which cover object placement only in relation to \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZnG9wrVxtM\"\u003eARkit surface plane detection\u003c/a\u003e, Google’s treatment looks exhaustive. Not only are there sections covering “tap to place,” “drag to place,” and “free placement” methods, Google also includes a section on creating a sense of realism that briefly touches on the use of physics in object placement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite what it’s missing, Google’s Augmented Reality Design Guidelines (GARDG) is a good starting point, with more practical advice and a more pragmatic layout. Since they launched it in the summer, there’s been a lot of new additions, like an excellent new section on \u003ca href=\"https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/ar-design/designing-the-experience/ui-components.html#\"\u003eUI components\u003c/a\u003e. Meanwhile, a section entitled \u003ca href=\"https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/ar-design/designing-the-experience/experience.html\"\u003eDesigning the Experience\u003c/a\u003e covers practical concerns like onboarding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith its ongoing evolution, we can reasonably expect the guidelines to grow to reflect many of the areas of interest we’ve heard expressed. In the meantime, designers can fill in the gaps left by Google and Apple. We have the opportunity to shape best practices for 3D UX ourselves, and a few industry leaders have already started doing so. For instance, Bushra Mahmood, a designer currently with Unity, took the initiative to develop her own extensive design guidelines (well worth a look, \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@goatsandbacon/a-quick-guide-to-designing-for-augmented-reality-on-mobile-part-1-c8ecaaf303d5\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), while teams, like one at \u003ca href=\"https://uxplanet.org/design-challenge-rapid-prototyping-a-functioning-augmented-reality-app-fb73ede33a4e\"\u003eMarino Software\u003c/a\u003e, are bootstrapping entire new processes with a mishmash of existing tools.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis kind of grassroots work is crucial, because Apple’s and Google’s guidelines will never keep up with millions of creative people experimenting and innovating. By the time headsets are widely available, the distinction between 2D and 3D UX design will have been permanently erased.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy offering little in the way of resources, Apple and Google are holding the door wide open for anyone who wants to lead the way.

After all, we have these amazingly powerful computers at our disposal, where one of the fundamental aspects is effective \u003cem\u003erepetition and reuse\u003c/em\u003e. I.e. a computer is able to perfectly repeat the same action multiple times at blazing speeds, something utilized by writing professionals, software engineers, data researchers and others. But not as much by designers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday we are excited to introduce a novel new feature that is going to relieve this repetitive “monkey work” for designers and speed up your explorations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe call it Smart Selection — it helps you adjust spacing and arrangement of multiple items in a selection of objects on the canvas with ease, among other things. Think of it as a power-up. It gives you the freedom to focus on the essentials of your creative process, rather than the minutiae.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"how-smart-selection-works\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how-smart-selection-works\"\u003eHow Smart Selection works\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmart Selection works automatically on any selection or group of three or more items with equal, uniform spacing. With items selected, you can adjust spacing, position and size of all these items at once.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s what you can do with Smart Selection:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDrag the pink-colored handles in the space between objects to adjust spacing of all items.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDrag the ring to quickly rearrange items.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eClick one or more items’ pink rings to mark them: this allows resizing by pulling on their edges.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn building this feature, we wanted to find a solution within the paradigms that designers are already working in, rather than introduce a brand new way of thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith this in mind, we created a way to assist you right on the canvas where you are able to directly manipulate objects, without needing to learn any special new tools or object types. It’s a pure UI feature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"tidy-up\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#tidy-up\"\u003eTidy Up\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlongside Smart Selection, we’re introducing another great feature called Tidy Up which makes it fantastically easy to get a Smart Selection out of something messier. No need to be precise when playing around — just invoke the Tidy Up action to deftly arrange selected items. Think of it as a “distribute” function that does a better job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTidy Up takes the selected items and shifts them so that they’re both near each other and have the same spacing. The use cases go beyond just assisting with Smart Selection — you’ll find Tidy Up helpful with things like tables and toolbars. Unlike the traditional distribute function, the spacing will always be even.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo help you visualize how Tidy Up works, imagine working on 20 screens, all constituting one flow. We want these to be neatly arranged with perfect spacing in between, so that when we present this to other stakeholders, it looks refined.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eLeft: Manual work. Right: Tidy Up with Smart Selection.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoing this in traditional design tools often means manually going through each and every space (19 spaces to measure in our example!) and adjusting the ones that are off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Tidy Up all this can be done in a single quick action — select your screens and then click the Tidy Up button at the top of the right sidebar. The keyboard shortcut for Tidy Up is ⌥⌘T on macOS and ctrl-alt-T on other platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-s-next\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-s-next\"\u003eWhat\u0026#39;s next?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve got a lot more in store for you in the coming months, including support for 2D grids with Smart Selection and other exciting things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs always, we’re eager to hear what you do with Smart Selection and to get your feedback on how we can make it even better.

It will respond to your behavior by highlighting patterns in your keyboard use and help you discover new key combinations in a fun way. We’ve taken our inspiration from computing pioneer Douglas Engelbart, and wanted to briefly share how his work shaped our approach. (Read to the end for the deep dive into our new keyboard panel.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"er_aBPTpT-zM\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne Monday afternoon fifty years ago, on a stage by San Francisco’s Civic Center, computer pioneer Douglas Engelbart gave \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY\"\u003ea demonstration that forever altered the course of computing\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the time, computers were known to serve corporate and government needs: calculations, simulations, payroll. But Engelbart focused on something different: computers that were \u003cem\u003epersonal\u003c/em\u003e and could help with daily tasks. Collaborating with a few team members thirty miles away, he showed the audience how to write documents together, add graphics to make them better, create links between them and chat while doing it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe session received a standing ovation and helped inspire other tech industry leaders. Some of the most significant strides in people-oriented computing that came afterward — like Apple’s first Macintosh — can be traced directly back to this demo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut for me, just as important as the events shown on Engelbart’s screen was what was happening with his hands. On a custom-made tray, a traditional QWERTY keyboard was surrounded by two never-before-seen accessories: on the right, a thick box named a “mouse,” and on the left, an unusual one-handed device called a “keyset.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=308\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1200w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eDoug Engelbart used a mouse in the right hand and a keyset in the left\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe mouse initially stole all the glory, as it felt simple and friendly. But the keyset — a cross between a keyboard and a piano — was just as fascinating. With the mouse, Engelbart could point to things; with the keyset, he could describe what to do with them. At one point, he started aiming at a word with the mouse and then — still on the way there — used his other hand to quietly key in two letters: DW (“delete word”). The word disappeared.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe alliance between two hands and two devices made Engelbart’s presentation feel like nothing less than magic, the closest to a mind-meld with a machine we’d ever witnessed — or, in words of one of the attendees, like Engelbart was “dealing lightning with both hands.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePart of the wonder could be traced to the properties of our motor memory, which allow us to master physical actions to the point they become instinctive and subconscious. If you know a pianist or a dancer, ask them to describe their performance. They will struggle; they internalized their movements so much that they no longer even register as actions. The motor memory allows them to simply play or dance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEngelbart applied those same properties of motor memory to computer tasks. By mastering the mouse and the chords on his keyset, he was able to operate the computer with astonishing fluidity — and his prowess with both devices was a significant part of the demo’s impact.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-engelbart-s-demo-has-to-do-with-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-engelbart-s-demo-has-to-do-with-figma\"\u003eWhat Engelbart’s demo has to do with Figma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI can’t count how many times I’ve watched the Engelbart demo in awe. As a designer, I’ve long been fascinated by the universe of input devices — enough that I’ve decided to write a \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@mwichary/shift-happens-5b049f5a93a8\"\u003ebook about the history of keyboards\u003c/a\u003e. So when I joined forces with Figma to help with a few projects, I started thinking about not just the screen, but also the hands underneath it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuch like Engelbart’s demo, witnessing someone really good at using Figma will feel like a miracle. They’ll traverse the canvas, restyle objects, and create new designs at a miraculous pace, without ever glancing down at their hands. Just like watching an experienced pianist or dancer, it will almost feel like a performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd all this happens using a setup similar to Engelbart’s: one hand on the mouse, another on the keyboard. It’s still the best combination to free your mind to engage in the state of flow. Let your hands do their job, and instead of thinking of the tool you’re using, think about the problems you want to solve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut just as in 1968, one of those devices is much harder to master than the other. The mouse and its successors are easy to grab and use, even by a beginner. However, the long-gone keyset or modern keyboard shortcuts are a different story. They require practice and dedication to first explore and then commit into motor memory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo today, we’re adding a small improvement to Figma that might help: a better keyboard shortcut panel. Before now, that part of Figma hadn’t received much love. It was hard to scan and would take over the entire screen — making it hard to learn by actually trying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/037c41f4bc5da536bde89cbeef2aea82d1469ee0-600x450.png?rect=0,0,599,450\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/037c41f4bc5da536bde89cbeef2aea82d1469ee0-600x450.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/037c41f4bc5da536bde89cbeef2aea82d1469ee0-600x450.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/037c41f4bc5da536bde89cbeef2aea82d1469ee0-600x450.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 599w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe old keyboard panel\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82eaca0c5f1dbf8ae395663df8ee0ed709cfd950-600x450.png?rect=0,0,599,450\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82eaca0c5f1dbf8ae395663df8ee0ed709cfd950-600x450.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82eaca0c5f1dbf8ae395663df8ee0ed709cfd950-600x450.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82eaca0c5f1dbf8ae395663df8ee0ed709cfd950-600x450.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 599w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe new keyboard panel\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe new keyboard panel will appear underneath your canvas instead.

If you’re dealing with vectors, go straight to the shape tab to see a few power shortcuts like bending. If you — like me — usually work with fonts, head to the type section instead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also added a tab for some of the most rewarding combinations — those, just like the famous Engelbart demo, that come from a two-handed effort. For example, did you know holding \u003cstrong\u003eAlt\u003c/strong\u003e while moving the mouse around allows you to measure objects in Figma with ease?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd if you feel overwhelmed by all this, there’s one simple tab on the left hand side. It will introduce you to starter key combinations you will never want to live without, like how \u003cstrong\u003e⌘+\\\u003c/strong\u003e takes away all of the “chrome” so you can focus on your work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur hope is that this new setup will make it easier to learn shortcuts and help you discover related shortcuts you never knew existed. By working on this project, I personally discovered and learned how useful \u003cstrong\u003eShift+2\u003c/strong\u003e in the Zoom panel can be — it always does just the right thing to make the selection visible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe also added one more thing: the panel will actually listen to your fingers, highlight the shortcuts you just pressed, and remember them for the future. We hope this detail will make it easier and more fun to reflect on your use of keyboard with Figma, and notice the shortcuts you never had a chance to try.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe panel will highlight shortcuts you press and remember them in the future\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd yes, I know it feels a little silly contrasting a small improvement like this with a seminal moment in computing history known as “The Mother Of All Demos.” But even small steps are worth celebrating, particularly if they can give your motor memory a chance to shine. :·)\u003c/p\u003e\u003csvg width=\"93\" height=\"13\" fill=\"none\" _key=\"RstqMWhCLsTV\" _type=\"horizontalRule\"\u003e\u003ccircle cx=\"6.5\" cy=\"6.5\" r=\"6.5\" fill=\"#6A6A6A\"\u003e\u003c/circle\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"#6A6A6A\" d=\"M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z\"\u003e\u003c/path\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003cp\u003e*P.S.

It may sound crazy, but Figma is committed to building an open design platform. With this Challenge, we’re putting our money where our mouth is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesigners work in many different ways — with an array of stakeholders and clients — and shouldn’t have to worry about switching between tools on projects. We’ve had Sketch import available since we launched, so this is a natural evolution of Figma’s design ecosystem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSketch export is the first Figma API Challenge, where we invite designers and developers to experiment with Figma’s functionality.

Each of the objects in the second file don’t necessarily have a 1:1 relationship between Figma and Sketch, so the exporters will be judged subjectively. How easy is the exporter to use? How creative is its approach to porting the design over?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe judges will weight these different factors in their review and provide a total score. For example, 5% of each submission’s score will be based on the quality of its code and GitHub documentation.

Designers had to campaign and negotiate even the smallest design updates.

The agency’s approach is all about being fast and nimble. With a portfolio of 25+ brands, 250+ employees, four offices and remote associates, Aisle Rocket Studios is not your typical agency. As featured in \u003ca href=\"https://marketing.cioreview.com/vendor/2017/aisle_rocket_studios\"\u003eCIOReview\u003c/a\u003e, ARS’s Chief Digital Officer Kashif Zaman explains, “Our clients see us as an extension of their team. We are their growth hackers and relentless problem solvers.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDistinguishing themselves from the typical agency model, the designers at ARS identify themselves as builders. As Zaman puts it, “It’s the idea that the development team is technically a member of the creative team and there is a level of homogeneity between the roles — their skill sets are different but the creative process is interchangeable.” Therefore, one of the core design principles at ARS is that 80 percent of the creative process should take place in the browser. But given the agency is spread out across four locations with remote associates, real collaboration was a challenge. That was until the Whirlpool account team made big waves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"so-many-files-in-so-many-places\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#so-many-files-in-so-many-places\"\u003eSo many files in so many places!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMatt Carson, Creative Director at ARS working remote in Scottsdale, was brought onto the Whirlpool account last minute to help with a particular project with a tight deadline.

Roper says, “With Figma I’m able to view and share digital concepts with simulated functionality without needing a login or having developers code the experience.” As a result, the review process between agency and client become significantly shorter because they can iterate together in real-time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"inclusive-design-empowers\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#inclusive-design-empowers\"\u003eInclusive design empowers.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith a shared workspace in Figma, it’s all the easier to host 80 percent of the creative process in the browser. Zaman explains, “We don’t need to physically share a screen to collaborate, rather developers can follow along with designers or copywriters with designers, all within Figma.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor Taylor Madaffari, copywriter at ARS, having access to make changes to copy directly within designs has completely changed her approach as a copywriter. She no longer has to work in a separate space, drop in copy and make updates so it fits within a design, instead she and Vander Ark are already collaborating in the early stages of design. Madaffari explains, “Figma leveled the playing field and made the entire design process more democratic. For the first time, I feel empowered to have input on designs.” Copy is no longer an afterthought but rather a distinct design element.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd developers have embraced Figma, too. Before, the team was handing off static files to development which resulted in a lot of back and forth. “It was excruciating at times for our developers so they welcomed Figma with open arms,” recalls Carson. Figma reduces the friction of turning visual concepts into code because developers are granted viewer access to files early to make sure designs are achievable from the onset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-small-team-makes-big-impact\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-small-team-makes-big-impact\"\u003eA small team makes big impact.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Whirlpool team started to capture the attention of the larger agency, they were leaner, faster and more collaborative. As Zaman puts it, “they had the magic sauce and everyone wanted in.” With Figma, the team consolidated their tooling, tightened complex workflows and centralized files. Even client Glenn Roper, digital brand manager at Whirlpool, agrees, “Figma enables greater collaboration between my team and our agency, saving time and money without sacrificing creativity.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, collaborative open design is the standard at ARS.

You might use the same foundational components everywhere, like lists, avatars or status bars, but you’ll still need to tweak and adapt instances of them depending on context. Maybe individual list items will have different lines of text, or the background color on a status bar will change if a user hovers over it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of forcing you to build these particular instances from scratch, design tools should make it easy for you to tweak the original component, while still maintaining your design system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s where Figma’s component overrides function comes in handy. Overrides work exactly how they sound — by allowing you to “override” properties of a design instance without breaking it apart from its parent component. You can change things like the background color, font, stroke, or other properties in an instance, and the instance will still stay connected to the original parent component. As a result, when you adjust the parent component, the instance will continue to inherit those changes — while maintaining its distinct differentiators.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"overrides-in-action\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#overrides-in-action\"\u003eOverrides in action\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Figma, you can override a nearly endless number of properties in an instance, including:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eColor\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eType alignment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdd, remove, modify strokes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStyles\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOpacity\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBlend mode\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFills\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEffects (drop shadows, blurs)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eText\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVisibility (show/hide)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re looking for inspiration, here are a few concrete examples of ways you might use overrides to maintain consistency in your design system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e1) \u003cstrong\u003eCreate a realistic list of information\u003c/strong\u003e — Working on a simple to-do app or a complex table view for a dashboard?

Here’s the 101 rundown on everything you might want to know about them (\u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/drawing/components\"\u003eand you can find more information in our help documentation here.)\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Can you duplicate a master component in a file?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: No, it isn’t possible to duplicate a component in a single file. When you do that it will always create an instance of the original component. However, when you copy a component from file A and paste it into file B, you will have a fully functioning component in file B.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Can you reset overrides in an instance?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: Yes! If you decide you want to reset a component back to its original state then you can, but one of the unique things about Figma is that you can also reset any property for each element within your instance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: If you edit your master component, will it automatically update the overridden instance?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: Yes and no. As you further change the master component, you’ll see that the instance still updates accordingly, except for whatever property you manually changed. For example, if you have a blue circle as a component and change the instance’s color to green, then the instance will stay green even if you edit the master component to be red. However, if you change the stroke weight of the master component, then the instance will reflect those changes synchronously.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Do overrides work across files?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: No, they do not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Are there any properties you can’t override?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA: Yes, any properties that impact the layout of child layers.

Today, the university is made up of six colleges, each with their own \u003ca href=\"https://www.arts.ac.uk/about-ual\"\u003erich history\u003c/a\u003e and identity — most dating back to the early 19th century. But their unique past presents design challenges because the organization uses a number of identities. As Declan Talbert, a UX designer at UAL, put it, “everyone looks after their own site and they each want to implement their own style.” As a result, UAL’s digital experiences can feel disjointed and inconsistent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince last year (2017), the User Experience team has been focused on reshaping UAL’s core digital experience to be more user-centric as part of the Digital Transformation Program. The team partnered with the University’s brand, content and development teams for the program. Updating the website was phase one. And while a design system would be an eventual output of the project, the team stumbled upon the opportunity midway through the website project. As Andrea Caporale, UX manager at UAL, said, “the design system was good collateral damage.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"making-the-switch-mid-project\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#making-the-switch-mid-project\"\u003eMaking the switch mid-project\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe UX team tested several design tools during the early phases of the website project and struggled with the siloed nature of most applications. As Talbert said, “We immediately fell into issues trying to collaborate with our Sketch files — the problem was we were not able to work seamlessly on files together.” Between working with outside agencies and internal stakeholders spread across 14 campuses, the team grew frustrated. Versioning issues caused confusion, syncing files took time, and, as a result, communication loops became exhausting which caused a rift between dev and design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter just three days we saw all the benefits of Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter testing out Figma, Talbert recommended the team try it. Because Figma is accessible from any computer with a browser and enabled the team to collaborate online in real-time, they decided to make the switch, even though they were midway through the website project. Because importing their original files from Sketch was a simple drag and drop, Caporale said, “after just three days we saw all the benefits of Figma.” Having a centralized source of the truth across developers, designers, key stakeholders and even executives resulted in an unprecedented level of transparency. And most impactful was the new level of collaboration between development and design. According to front-end developer Bo Ajayi-Walmsley, “Just seeing all our work within one tool was incredibly useful.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?rect=0,0,1599,900\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=377\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"go-big-with-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#go-big-with-figma\"\u003eGo big with Figma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEquipped with the right tool all teams and external agencies were finally speaking the same language.

Sometimes, you’ll want users of your prototype to be able to return to the previous screen — for instance, you may be designing a confirmation menu. And, if the screen can be accessed from several different locations, Back Transitions allow you to keep track of where the user started without duplicating the screen and transition for each initial location.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne thing to note: If you navigate to the current frame with an animated transition, pressing the back button will play that animation in reverse.

I’d find in Sketch a lot of the time I’d make a whole bunch of masks to get my image to be the right size.

Design and develop your tool with the wisdom of a designer and engineer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs an early step, he built a basic version of his planned icon library’s UI in Sketch. (These days Jackie uses Figma — we’ve become the primary design tool for Microsoft’s Cloud and AI design studio teams 💪.) He took inspiration from IconJar’s design and mocked up a similar version, styling it in Microsoft’s Fabric design language.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce he was finished with the design, he needed to build it. He had some experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript from creating his portfolio website, so he decided to leverage that existing knowledge by tapping a beginner-friendly Javascript library called \u003ca href=\"https://www.meteor.com/\"\u003eMeteor.js\u003c/a\u003e. It allowed him to build both the front-end and back-end databases without spending too much time mastering a new programming language.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe took a \u003ca href=\"https://www.meteor.com/tutorials\"\u003eReact tutorial\u003c/a\u003e on Meteor’s website, and applied what he learned to build the icon library. For example, Meteor’s tutorial taught Jackie how to build a database for a to-do list, and he extended that concept to creating a database for his icon library. With a real problem in mind that needed fixing, he felt more than motivated to learn along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_3-collect-and-extract-the-icons-from-the-company\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_3-collect-and-extract-the-icons-from-the-company\"\u003e3. Collect and extract the icons from the company’s repository\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor those not in the know, icons are normally stored in a font file. The challenge with icons is that you cannot ‘type’ the icons using your keyboard since there are many more characters than keys on a keyboard. Instead, you have to copy the ‘icon character’ and paste it into your design to use. Previously, designers had to keep a file with a bunch of icon characters that they used often so they could copy and paste in their designs. What Jackie’s tool does is allow designers to search and copy the ‘icon character’ easily in one central location.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe downloaded and extracted the files and got the actual unicode characters of each icon. Next he found a Microsoft documentation page with all the icons and their corresponding class names used by engineers. He copied the list of icon names into an Excel spreadsheet then converted that into a JSON file to use in his code. Presto.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_4-distribution\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_4-distribution\"\u003e4.

He hosted the tool on Microsoft Azure, a cloud-computing service for building and managing services and applications that is open to the public . At this point he didn’t think too much about the distribution, he just sent a simple email with a link to the tool to his team, then it spread to the rest of the design studio through word-of-mouth.

For a long time, we stuck as much information as possible into our SVG files, hoping it would help other tools render and import designs accurately.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFueled by feedback from our community, we’ve had a change of heart and have been gradually tweaking the Export format over the past few months. As our \u003ca href=\"https://releases.figma.com/\"\u003erelease note junkies\u003c/a\u003e have noticed, our SVGs are now simpler, more compact and compatible with more tools (like Android Studio). Read on for a quick primer on SVG and details about what we changed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSVG — which stands for Scalable Vector Graphics — is an increasingly popular image format for 2D vector graphics. It emerged in 2001 as an open specification aimed primarily for use in web browsers. Unlike traditional bitmap image formats like JPG and PNG that become blurry when resized, SVG is designed to always remain crystal clear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s because SVGs are effectively instructions describing how to paint an image from scratch while bitmap images are static snapshots of the final result. SVG is perfect for assets like logos and icons on the web, where they might show up anywhere from a huge monitor to a high resolution retina screen on a phone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s the rub though: there’s no standardized way of converting the SVG markup to pixels on the screen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s the rub though: there’s no standardized way of converting the SVG markup to pixels on the screen. Most tools have their own custom SVG importers or renderers and the quality of these implementations varies widely. The SVG specification is also sufficiently complex that most tools only understand a subset and have bugs even when dealing with the subset that they claim to support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, SVG has a nifty feature that allows you to define instructions in a \u003ccode\u003edefs\u003c/code\u003e block and reference them repeatedly with the \u003ccode\u003euse\u003c/code\u003e element. As we learned the hard way, Android Studio does not support this in most cases.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to choking many importers, our complicated and extraneous markup also bloated the file size and made the output difficult to digest for humans. Many of our users had resort to post-processing with tools such as SVGO and svgito or, even worse, by manually cleaning up the file by hand. 😬😬😬\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"from-figma-s-svg-na-vet-to-our-new-pragmatic\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#from-figma-s-svg-na-vet-to-our-new-pragmatic\"\u003eFrom Figma’s SVG naïveté… to our new pragmatic approach\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople have been asking for smaller, simpler SVGs from Figma for a long time. We resisted making the change because we were hoping that SVG would become the de facto data transfer format between design tools. In this utopia, you could easily spread your design workflow across different design tools depending on what was the best fit for each stage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe now accept that was a bit of pie-in-the-sky naïveté, and our new SVG Exporter takes a more pragmatic approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo understand the improvements, let’s start with a seemingly innocent example: a frame

If there are delays in the wrong places, it totally ruins the illusion that the tool is an extension of your mind and body. Imagine the frustration of trying to pound in a nail when the hammer trails behind your hand by half a second.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe want Figma to be an extension of your creative mind. To meet that goal, we need to remove as much friction as possible from the process of placing your ideas into a visual space to discuss, collaborate on and convert into working software. To reduce that friction, we need an ongoing focus on Figma’s performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince the beginning, we’ve tried to design every feature with performance in mind. When we discover targeted performance wins through careful analysis of our code (running on real documents that users share with us), we take them.

We worked on these optimizations for months. The reward was massive improvements in zooming, dragging and file loading speed (up to 3x faster!) in dense files.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe rolled out these changes to the entire user base over the past several weeks. Read on to learn more about what changed, how we measured these gains, and what’s next for performance work in Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"file-loading-up-to-3x-faster\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#file-loading-up-to-3x-faster\"\u003eFile loading — up to 3x faster\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eFile loading speed in action, on a real design document \u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs our product matures, we’ve noticed teams at large organizations creating ever more complex design documents in Figma. Users push our tool to its limits, nesting components many layers deep to give them flexibility and power in their design systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Fluent Design Team at Microsoft, for example, rebuilt every Windows native control in a single Figma document, capturing components in all possible states and permutations. These seemingly simple operations add a lot of computational complexity, and load times suffered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We were stress-testing the limits of what Figma could do before we adopted it as our team’s primary tool,” Kyle Anderson, Senior Product Designer on the Fluent team, told us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFortunately, over the last 2 months WebAssembly optimizations and a collection of other changes helped us reduce the load time for a large realistic document from 29 seconds down to under 8 seconds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;It’s considerably more lightweight and much more performant,” Kyle said. “The speed at which your team hot fixes stuff is really encouraging, and we couldn’t be happier with the product.\u0026#34; WebAssembly is now enabled in all the common places that our users work within Figma [1]. This includes the desktop app, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both macOS and Windows.

Two of the most common operations where Figma users need speed are zooming in/out and dragging layers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe renewed our focus on improving the fluidity of these common behaviors, and since the beginning of the year, we’ve reduced the “hitches” you see when zooming or dragging.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"zooming-is-now-up-to-3x-faster\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#zooming-is-now-up-to-3x-faster\"\u003eZooming is now up to 3x faster.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eZooming now actually zoooooms\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"dragging-is-now-up-to-3x-faster\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#dragging-is-now-up-to-3x-faster\"\u003eDragging is now up to 3x faster.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eDragging feels like less of a drag\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eN3TWORK, a 100-person gaming and media company, particularly appreciated these improvements. Their files are dense and packed with bitmap images, so their UX Design Director Adam Donkin came by in person to talk through performance. “That’s one of the best things about Figma — I feel like I’ve built a relationship with people there, and we work through problems together,” he said. “It makes it feel like Figma is my product.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a few minutes diagnosing the issue with Adam in person, we enabled our new renderer for N3TWORK. They saw an instantaneous uptick in the speed of component publishing and file loading. “You didn’t have to measure it, it was completely obvious,” Adam said. “I walked back to the office and several people had tested it and were seeing improvements in all cases. That was super exciting.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"why-we-measure-both-average-frame-time-maximum\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#why-we-measure-both-average-frame-time-maximum\"\u003eWhy we measure both average frame time \u0026amp; maximum frame time\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith continuous operations like zooming and dragging, it’s smoothness we care about, not duration. There’s a huge experiential gap between a drag taking 500ms and getting no feedback until it’s complete versus a drag taking 500ms where you’re getting full visual feedback at 60 frames per second.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of our design team’s guiding principles is “favor direct manipulation,” and nothing breaks the illusion of direct manipulation like delayed and infrequent feedback.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of our design team’s guiding principles is “favor direct manipulation.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo measure the quality of this feedback, we track two key metrics: average frame time and maximum frame time. Each contribute to smoothness in dragging, so they both must be monitored to understand the impact of an optimization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHigher maximum frame times produce a jarring “hitching” effect, like your sailing boat suddenly hitting a rock. In comparison, higher average times produce choppiness, like driving a car over cobblestones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe below examples show this difference between the two in practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMaximum frame times increase (from left to right) while average frame times stay the same\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith this example of maximum frame times degrading, all three gifs have an average frame rate of 15fps. In the leftmost animation, every frame is 67ms. In the center animation, most frames are 33ms, but every sixth frame is 200ms long. In the right animation, most frames are 33ms, but every eleventh frame is 367ms long.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite one metric staying constant, the other degrades enough to make the path of the ball seem jarring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the next example, it’s the average frame time that degrades from left to right. Rather than switching between smoothness and hitching, a low average frame rate produces a choppy appearance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eAverage frame times increase (from left to right) while maximum frame times stay the same\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll three of these have a maximum frame time of 167ms, with most frames taking 33ms. In the left animation, however, the 167ms hitches happen every 28th frame. In the center animation, every 10th frame. In the right animation, every 4th frame.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn an ideal world, applications would never drop below 60fps. As we move towards that world, however, it’s helpful to monitor both of these metrics over time. We could instead look at a full histogram of frame times, but it would be difficult to chart our progress over time with so many variables.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"tracking-figma-s-average-and-maximum-frame-times\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#tracking-figma-s-average-and-maximum-frame-times\"\u003eTracking Figma’s average and maximum frame times\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe measured our progress over the last 3 months for zooming and dragging in a complex document in terms of average and maximum frame times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you can see from the charts below, both zooming and dragging frame times decreased. For zooming in our benchmark document, we’ve maintained the necessary average frame time for 60fps and reduced the max frame time enough to avoid dropping any frames. For dragging, we improved the average frame from 30fps to 60fps, and reduced hitches from 120ms to 30ms, dropping a single frame instead of six during the hitch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg

consistent, but also realistic. To count as consistent, they must do exactly the same thing every time, so we can tell when performance improvements are the result of a code change versus a changing usage pattern. For them to be realistic, we need to be testing against real design files, not just files containing grids of 1000 gray rectangles. Making Figma really fast for unrealistic use cases isn’t terribly helpful to anyone 🙂.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo create consistent and realistic benchmarks, we run a version of our app in \u003ca href=\"https://electronjs.org/\"\u003eElectron\u003c/a\u003e (basically a fancy wrapper around Chrome), and simulate user interactions like dragging, panning, zooming, selecting, and a few other key interactions.

They perfect deliverables in secret until they’re ready for formal presentations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut we’re entering a new era of design, and pioneers are forging far more transparent ways of working. Citrusbyte, a 90-person strategy, design and development firm based in Los Angeles, is one such leader. They value openness to such an extent that they share their raw, in-progress design files with clients. (I can practically hear all you perfectionists shuddering from afar.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not for moral reasons. The Citrusbyte team says that transparency benefits their business — resulting in more streamlined workflows, better project outcomes, and happier clients. It’s a big departure from the traditional culture of siloed design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCitrusbyte’s unconventional approach has paid off handsomely. Since the company was founded in 2007, they’ve gone from working primarily with startups to now serving Fortune 1000 companies, including Apple, Caterpillar, Sony, Intel, AT\u0026amp;T and the Brooklyn Nets.

They wanted clients to peruse projects often and follow the evolution of the work. Because design tools didn’t allow for that, Citrusbyte’s staff had to export and email files to customers, or sync to services like Dropbox and Google Drive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we say we’re giving the client 100 percent transparency, but we’re using Sketch or Photoshop, then being 100 percent transparent is impossible, said Citrusbyte’s Design Manager Alex Zapadenko. The process influences the tools and the tools influence the process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eCitrusbyte designers use Figma Multiplayer to work in a file at the same time\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat all changed with Figma. Because our platform runs in the cloud, the design files are always up to date and can be shared with a link (which stays the same). Many people can be in a design file simultaneously and see the changes in real time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026#34;I tell clients, You’ll get continuous design delivery from day one and it will be amazing, said Alex. You’ll go into a design file like it’s a room and walk around.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis accessibility eases clients’ nerves, according to Pablo Franco, a Citrusbyte designer. “There’s a feeling of security in a Figma project,” he said. “It’s not a closed environment where all the work I do is in a black box.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, that’s many designers’ worst nightmare — that a client, or manager, could check on a project in various states of disarray. They might misunderstand the messy stages of the creative process. But Citrusbyte deals with that issue through communication and expectation management. Pablo uses this metaphor with his clients: “You may want a bike, but if you peek in on me you’ll see me working on the chain.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll this additional transparency ultimately benefits Citrusbyte. “When you bring the folks you’re working with directly into the project, you create a lot more buy-in,” said Adonya Ourshalimian, Client Partner at Citrusbyte. “There’s a much better understanding of what’s actually happening.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"moving-faster-the-figma-way\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#moving-faster-the-figma-way\"\u003eMoving faster the Figma way\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAside from just letting clients drop in on the work, Citrusbyte encourages them to give feedback throughout the design process. This was complicated before they found Figma. Sometimes they’d email clients PNGs or PDFs, and clients would email or Slack back responses. But there was no way of knowing what part of the design they were referring to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou had to write back, I don’t know what you’re talking about, Sam Small, another Citrusbyte designer, said.

Since it’s web-based, there’s no need to re-upload files when designs change — the prototype always reflects the most current version. Clients can make changes themselves, like experimenting with different headline copy to see what feels best. “This decreases email chains revolving around small text tweaks,” said Sam. “It lets the designer focus on designing.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor more formal reviews, Citrusbyte holds regular meetings with clients to go over progress — sometimes daily if it’s an aggressive timeline. “Before Figma, we’d spend a lot of time putting together this refined view, a nicely spruced up file with flow connectors,” Sam said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma’s \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040318013\"\u003eobservation mode\u003c/a\u003e, where users can click on a presenter’s avatar to follow their screen, cut out that hassle. The presenter can simply move around the design to demo it. “It saves a ton of time from that old process,” Sam said. “It’s night and day.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLittle features like this add up to big wins in productivity. Sam estimates he saves 30–50% time using Figma, compared to his previous workflow. “There’s just so many steps that have been removed,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?rect=0,0,1600,888\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=372\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe time savings helped Citrusbyte take on more work than they otherwise could have, and clients noticed.

Josh and Tyrale said beware. They spent years testing different options — in some cases lurking at Best Buy, in others bumming tablets and phones off friends. Ultimately, Samsung offered the best option because of the way it handles display size. It changes the DPI when it broadcasts a phone onto a larger screen, so there’s more visual space in the projection, appropriate for the size of the display.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“These ones are as close to plug and play as you can get,” Tyrale said. “You can pull the device out of the box at the phone store and log into Figma and it’ll work.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt that point you question: Why do I have a laptop?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other key issue to consider in buying your mobile device is the way it interprets mouse clicks versus finger taps. For example, iPads interpret anything touching the screen as a finger. Android, depending on whether it’s Samsung, HTC, Nokia or Motorola, can sense the difference. If Figma thinks it’s receiving a finger touch all it will let you do is move objects around on the screen — not resize things, use the bounding box, or click and drag.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We had to look for the right combination of hardware app and browser that could communicate mouse clicks to Figma,” Tyrale said. By the end of their hunt, they’d tested 30 browsers and countless phones.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I can pick up anybody’s computer, anywhere in the country at any point in time, as long as you give me a browser with a cord and an input device, I can do my full job.

They often have invisible bounding boxes around them that can be tricky to nail (much like \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitbox\"\u003ethe ‘hit box’ targets in FPS games\u003c/a\u003e). For example, let’s say you create a standard component, with only a text label in it. By default, when you create a text layer in Figma the handles (dashed lines) surrounding it are small, wrapping the text nearly 1:1.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Kiwi.com, we’ve gotten in the habit of automatically stretching those handles to the borders of the component. Then, we can double click almost anywhere in the component to edit the label.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou have to take a slightly different tact when you have two labels in a component. If you stretch both of these labels to the edges, they will overlap (and the handy ‘stretch to click’ technique no longer works). In this case, make one of the labels a bit smaller (I usually make it half the size), and push it to the top of the layer list in the left-hand panel. Then, you have a convenient way to double click and edit both layers, either by clicking the large one on the canvas itself, or by clicking smaller one in the layers panel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f5ff9a4deefa2c97b4d8ef3cdaf0aa67cbcf8f-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f5ff9a4deefa2c97b4d8ef3cdaf0aa67cbcf8f-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f5ff9a4deefa2c97b4d8ef3cdaf0aa67cbcf8f-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f5ff9a4deefa2c97b4d8ef3cdaf0aa67cbcf8f-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f5ff9a4deefa2c97b4d8ef3cdaf0aa67cbcf8f-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 799w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"component-override-logic\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#component-override-logic\"\u003eComponent override logic\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eComponent override suggestions are based on the size of the components.

People sit in a living room and listen to an album from start to finish with one rule: Stay quiet and pay attention. That means no talking, checking your phone for a new Tinder match, or showing up late. What you can do is doodle, write down memories surfaced by the music, or sit back with your eyes closed and let sound waves wash over you. Afterwards, the group discusses their thoughts and people show off whatever they’ve sketched.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt may sound like a simple setup, but a ton of effort goes on behind the scenes. First, Mike has to find an artist who puts a lot of thought into the rhythm and narrative arc of their albums.

For Mike, this auditory, artistic side project refills his creative coffers, giving him energy for his visual, systematic work as an interface designer.

But it gets really interesting when you consider how it improves our workflow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBelow are four ways Figma can fundamentally improve how we work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_1-we-can-iterate-way-faster-with-real-time\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_1-we-can-iterate-way-faster-with-real-time\"\u003e1. We can iterate WAY faster with real-time collaboration\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can \u003ca href=\"https://blog.figma.com/how-braintree-cut-time-spent-on-design-critiques-by-50-1ebc23061b74\"\u003edo a design review\u003c/a\u003e, make updates on the fly, and instantly get feedback on your changes. The time between iterations can go from days down to minutes because there is zero time wasted uploading or syncing screens, creating share links, messaging people to look at the links, and so on. When I experienced this first-hand it was so amazing that I shed a single tear of joy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBelow are some real-life scenarios that can make work slow and tedious at the best of times and incredibly frustrating at the worst of times. All of these scenarios go away by using Figma:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen after syncing all your screens to InVision you realize you want to increase the font size slightly in a header component, so you make the change in your design file and then have to re-sync all the screens to InVision.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen you use Craft to sync a complex, multi-screen prototype to InVision and then need to spend what feels like an hour dragging and dropping the screens in the correct order in InVision because Craft uploads them in a random sequence.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen someone in another timezone forgets to commit or upload their work so you have to wait until they’re back online to get the latest designs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen there’s a software update and all the 3rd-party plugins break and you lose hours.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_2-our-design-process-becomes-more-inclusive-and\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_2-our-design-process-becomes-more-inclusive-and\"\u003e2. Our design process becomes more inclusive and seamless\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll of a sudden the design file becomes a venue where anyone can meet up and \u003ca href=\"https://blog.figma.com/why-transparent-open-design-leads-to-happier-clients-aaf98a7cd50c\"\u003ehave a discussion about the designs\u003c/a\u003e. This means that it’s easier for designers to work in parallel, exploring options and iterating in shorter increments. This means that developers can spot and voice technical concerns sooner rather than later. And this means that stakeholders, project managers, or anyone with the link can see how the design is unfolding from an idea to a polished visual, rather than waiting for a big reveal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of fragmenting the design process across multiple files, there is now one place that can tell the whole story and evolve as the design process unfolds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI like what Thomas Lowry, a designer at OpenText, wrote about \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@nspace/figma-is-transforming-my-entire-workflow-2ce2df2c12c2\"\u003ehow his design process has changed by using Figma\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we begin to dive into a massive website project, Figma is quickly becoming an essential part of our process. We will produce our wireframing and low-fidelity prototypes in Figma all the way through to the the visual design phase. During this process we will begin establishing components and push them to the team library for use across many files. As we vet out the components in different scenarios, and the design evolves, being able to make modifications that are global across all files will be a huge time saver.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_3-our-transition-from-design-to-code-is-likely\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_3-our-transition-from-design-to-code-is-likely\"\u003e3. Our transition from design to code is likely to be faster and more consistent\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s because with Figma, it’s easier to structure our designs in a way that reflects how those designs will be coded.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo understand why, you need to know \u003ca href=\"https://help.figma.com/drawing/tools/creating-groups-frames\"\u003ehow frames work\u003c/a\u003e. Figma uses frames instead of artboards. Frames are different because you can nest frames inside a frame. When you place a smaller frame over a larger frame, the two frames are automatically grouped and the smaller frame becomes the child of the larger, parent frame. Children frames are \u003ca href=\"https://blog.figma.com/5-essential-ways-to-use-design-constraints-29fb21cbcf40\"\u003epositioned and constrained\u003c/a\u003e relative to their parent. This is one of those things that takes some getting used to, but then once you do, you wonder how you ever did without it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can use frames to divide a screen into content areas and then nest components (which are themselves a bunch of nested frames) inside of those sections. This approach combined with auto-grouping, relative positioning, and constraints makes it easy to quickly build out consistent and responsive designs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing frames like this is helpful for developers because a frame in Figma is akin to a container in HTML. When developers inspect the designs, they’ll be able to see UI elements nested in their respective containers, which means they’ll have a more accurate blueprint to refer to as they write their code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bacd7d021222e0f6bc34d3be8f4458cdc68e638e-800x561.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=470\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bacd7d021222e0f6bc34d3be8f4458cdc68e638e-800x561.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bacd7d021222e0f6bc34d3be8f4458cdc68e638e-800x561.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bacd7d021222e0f6bc34d3be8f4458cdc68e638e-800x561.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bacd7d021222e0f6bc34d3be8f4458cdc68e638e-800x561.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 800w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_4-our-design-systems-will-be-more-flexible-and\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_4-our-design-systems-will-be-more-flexible-and\"\u003e4.

But if you want to change anything else — say, text size, border weight, or background color — you’d have to Detach from Symbol and create a slightly different version of the same UI element. To solve this you can nest every variation in one symbol, but then you end up with an overrides panel from hell. With large projects and complex UIs, organizing and maintaining all the permutations quickly becomes untenable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Figma, you can \u003ca href=\"https://blog.figma.com/components-in-figma-e7e80fcf6fd2\"\u003eaccess and modify the properties of any layer in a component\u003c/a\u003e without detaching it from the master. The same thing goes for nested components. Now whenever you change a property of a layer in the master component, those changes will only get propagated to instances for which that property hasn’t already been overridden.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think these three gifs do a good job of visually describing how it works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eCreate a component and then copy it to create two instances of the master.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eChanges to the master component are instantly propagated to all of its instances.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eExcept that any overridden property will stay overridden, even when the master is changed.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"how-are-components-easier-to-design-with-than\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#how-are-components-easier-to-design-with-than\"\u003eHow are components easier to design with than symbols?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, you don’t have to worry about a naming structure (i.e. Icons/Search) as you’re creating components. You can rename a master component later and it will update all instances — not the case in Sketch. And to create a category of components, just group them in a frame and name that frame whatever the category is. That means it’s easy to reorganize things later just by dragging components around. For me, this really reduced the cognitive overhead of both creating components and keeping track of them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond of all, accessing components in Figma is way easier than accessing symbols in Sketch. Once again you don’t have to think about a naming structure to navigate a nested menu of symbol names. Instead, \u003ca href=\"https://blog.figma.com/team-libraries-in-figma-409fa5e20f7\"\u003eyou can find (and see!) components\u003c/a\u003e as a list of thumbnails. To add a component to a screen or to swap an instance, just drag and drop to the canvas. Or you can copy-paste the master component to create a new instance — you can’t even do this in Sketch without creating a new symbol.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f667cbe6322d5408de310599040852b0590d423-800x768.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=643\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f667cbe6322d5408de310599040852b0590d423-800x768.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f667cbe6322d5408de310599040852b0590d423-800x768.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f667cbe6322d5408de310599040852b0590d423-800x768.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f667cbe6322d5408de310599040852b0590d423-800x768.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 800w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSee and access components from a tab in the layers panel\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother thing that makes designing with components easier is that in Figma you can edit the master component in context of the larger view, rather than having to go to a separate page to make edits.

Their chosen muses can be anything or anyone: graffiti, a short film, architecture, even a moment in history.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur second subject in the series, Linda Eliasen, is currently the Head of Design at Help Scout. She’s spent her career as an intern for adult swim, an illustrator for MailChimp, and as the first designer at Dropbox to work on Dropbox Paper. And she also had a hand in creating this wonderfully weird recruiting video for Dropbox. She’s inspired by people who push the envelope — those rabble rousers of society, the outliers among the sheeple.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLinda was raised in the conservative town of Fayetteville, Georgia. Her creative and inquisitive personality didn’t mesh with the slow as molasses Southern town, so her sources of inspiration were particularly important for her growth as an artist. Each one opened a window to broader worlds, where women can break the rules, act goofy and strong, and even fart with their armpits. (We’re looking at you, Bartman.) As she grew up, her inspirations grew with her, replacing touchstones like religion with new sources of fantastical magic, like science. Later she would find reconciliation with her small town upbringing through William Eggleston’s unabashed photography, and a bet between two directors would teach her to shut up and get work done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ll let Linda take it from here. 💃\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de1cca015de9fe67047fcb89dd44eaffb0d15f0b-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de1cca015de9fe67047fcb89dd44eaffb0d15f0b-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de1cca015de9fe67047fcb89dd44eaffb0d15f0b-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de1cca015de9fe67047fcb89dd44eaffb0d15f0b-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de1cca015de9fe67047fcb89dd44eaffb0d15f0b-800x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 799w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eI never know what to say when asked how I stay inspired. I mentally spin in circles and end up saying something cliche like “travel!” Because secretly, I worry about my sources of inspiration constantly. I want to know how everyone else stays inspired, because I’m basically dead inside. What happened to the teenage spark? I vaguely remember what it was like to be 19 and out of breath because I was learning Color Theory for the first time and it was FASCINATING.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEveryone has their own sources of inspiration, I guess. Historically, people have considered Inspiration as an almost otherworldly inhabitation of the human mind, in which a vessel is possessed by a creative entity. Literal magic. Ghost stuff. And it’s never up to the Artist to decide when they will be inspired. They simply arrive at their desk and stay long enough to feel Inspiration’s grasp. I love that. It lets the artist separate their ego from their ideas. If their ‘inspired’ work is received well, it’s thanks to the Ghost of Inspiration. This way they stay grounded. And if the thing fails miserably then they’re still protected, because apparently the Ghost wasn’t on their A-game that day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnyway, below are five of the things that have shaped my work-in-progress self.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"inspiration-1-bart-simpson\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#inspiration-1-bart-simpson\"\u003eInspiration #1: Bart Simpson\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;h=377\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1280w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eBart Simpson inspired me to wonder what life would look like if I didn’t obey all the rules.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I was young, I was a shy and quiet rule follower.

He was brave enough to stand up to his own parents, to The Law aka Chief Wiggum, and to the bullies in school. A rebel with no cause, a skater boy, a total jerk that you secretly get behind him because he’s doing and saying all of the things you secretly want to say and do.

I wasn’t angry with this realization; I was more “inspired” than ever to know that this world was STILL filled with fantastic new things to learn about, even halfway through my twenties.

No matter the size of the project, I always struggle with the exchange between design and copy. The two are inextricably linked in the ultimate chicken egg quandary.

When we decided to add some new pages to our website, I geared myself up for a world of hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn previous roles, I’d spend weeks, sometimes months playing ping pong with the design team to build net-new website pages. I’d write copy in Google Docs, they’d design in Sketch, and we’d realize the copy didn’t fit. We’d try again for a second round, but then a design critique or a copy review would change everything. Once other stakeholders got involved — as they inevitably do — it would turn into a cluster.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt one company, most of our designers were remote. Our back and forth would get so crazy I’d wind up printing out the website designs, manually writing my edits on them with a pen, and scanning these marked up documents — yes scanning! — to share back with the team. It was like being trapped in a corporate version of Groundhog Day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma was a different story and a much more pleasant one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"here-s-how-the-website-project-went-using-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#here-s-how-the-website-project-went-using-figma\"\u003eHere’s how the website project went using Figma:\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI scoped out the main copy points I want to make for each page in one Google doc\u003cbr/\u003eThe design team created a project in Figma with frames for each website page\u003cbr/\u003eWe worked together — often simultaneously — to go from high fidelity wireframe to final design\u003cbr/\u003eNo endless cycles between design and copy. No waiting days or weeks to get designs back before I could iterate on the text. No need to export or email designs to stakeholders. No scrambling to update last minute tweaks right before a milestone review.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can imagine the time this saves and the frustration it averts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Figma, I can instantly see if the copy is too long or short in the context of the design and keep updating it without bothering the design team. The designers can focus on the actual design instead of managing the communication caused by a siloed tool chain. And the stakeholders can always see the latest design/copy, leave comments and access version history via the project’s URL. Better yet, we also use this URL to run user tests, so everyone involved can see the customer feedback. Having everyone and everything in one place is truly game changing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile using Figma doesn’t replace every web project meeting, we have way less of them, and we run them far more efficiently. The result? I no longer cringe when I hear the phrase “let’s update the website” and instead get excited to use Figma the way some of our users do. With our free tier you can check out Figma yourself to see if it could work for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you have a great web use case for Figma? We’d love to hear it.

Visit our Careers page for the full listing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere at Figma we have a much loved tradition called “3 things.” It goes something like this: Once a new Figmate has been around the office for a few months, they present three things that made them who they are at a company all-hands meeting. Their chosen trio can be anything — family members, a moment in time that struck them, or even their collection of sneakers (yes, that was one designer’s “thing”).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur Show and Tells offer glimpses into the wide-ranging backgrounds of people at Figma. A few fun facts that have emerged: Our head of support previously ran a record store. One of our engineers oversaw the animatronic effects in the 1995 film Babe. And our communications designer was born in Cairo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe wanted to share these quick vignettes with the outside world to give you a peek at the human faces powering Figma. First up? Kathryn Salant. Her three things — music, programming and cycling — speak to her love for incremental, measurable progress. Each task’s problem has a solution; songs (or code) that fall flat can be fixed with enough iteration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKathryn is a software engineer on the Organizations team who has been with us for two years — nearly an eternity in startup time. In a past life she was a trumpet player for the orchestral anarchist band Extra Action Marching Band. David Byrne (of Talking Heads fame) was a fan of their frenetic playing and invited them on tour as his closing act. She’s also a mother of two kids, an avid CycloCross racer and has worked with the SFMOMA on some of their earlier Internet projects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"thing-1-music\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#thing-1-music\"\u003eThing 1: Music\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cd96a70b704fc4dc9fa0cf54b8b4390b7ed21be8-728x494.png?rect=0,0,727,494\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=455\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cd96a70b704fc4dc9fa0cf54b8b4390b7ed21be8-728x494.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cd96a70b704fc4dc9fa0cf54b8b4390b7ed21be8-728x494.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cd96a70b704fc4dc9fa0cf54b8b4390b7ed21be8-728x494.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cd96a70b704fc4dc9fa0cf54b8b4390b7ed21be8-728x494.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 727w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eKathryn first picked up the trumpet in 5th grade. It became an adolescent passion of hers, and as she grew up she found herself haunting the three hometown jazz bars in Minnesota’s Twin Cities. For college she scored a full-ride scholarship to University of Wisconsin-Madison, spent a year at the London College of Music, and returned to Minnesota to study with her original teacher.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut by the end of college she was disillusioned with the classical music world — many of her classmates were narrowly focused on technical perfection and less interested in the inspiration and meaning behind the music they were playing. This was the point in her life where she fell in love with the arts and creativity — something that would eventually lead her to Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfterwards she moved to San Francisco and met The Extra Action Marching Band, a huge troupe of eccentrics who would crash parties with their avant garde orchestra. She signed on as a trumpet player in 2003, closed for David Byrne at The Fillmore, and even covered Beyonce’s “Crazy In Love” onstage with him. A later tour brought them to the South where they exclusively covered Black Sabbath with an Elvis impersonator in charge of Ozzy Osbourne’s vocals — suffice to say, the South was not amused with this interpretation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"thing-2-programming\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#thing-2-programming\"\u003eThing 2: Programming\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGrowing up in the small Midwestern town in the 90’s meant less access to computers; however, in the 6th grade Kathryn found herself in a class filled with Apple IIEs. The teacher taught everyone basic programming skills in Logo and she built a Super Mario demo that was so realistic the rest of the kids thought she was playing the actual game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe tinkering obsession continued into junior high. She would both fix and break her mom’s work computer by seeing how it was put together, often erasing important system files and then having to reinstall the OS.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLater, while at University, Kathryn filched a pirated copy of Flash 4 and installed it onto a computer in one of the music rooms. She was entranced by how Flash enabled, for the first time ever, motion graphics and interactivity on the Internet. The endless possibilities blew her away. She felt a kinship with this new intersection of tech and design: Flash attracted musicians, artists, and creative people. To the early aughts Silicon Valley programmers, code was the means to creative expression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter exploring Flash at length, Kathryn knew she wanted to write code that enabled other people to create things. She loved working with talented designers whose ideas were begging to come to life. And they loved working with her because she respected design and did her best to implement their vision meticulously. Her passion for open communication between teams is in line with Figma’s mission of building a design tool that strives for the same.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"thing-3-cyclocross-racing\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#thing-3-cyclocross-racing\"\u003eThing 3: CycloCross Racing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to music and programming, Kathryn has fallen in love with cycling as an adult. It’s a strange irony for her because she admits to not being the most athletic while growing up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSan Francisco changed that mindset, starting with the AIDS/LifeCycle seven-day ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles — after that she was hooked on the empowerment that came from pushing her body’s endurance. In 2006 she combined her love for community building and cycling by founding Butterlap, a weekly bike ride through San Francisco with only two rules: 1) don’t be an asshole and 2) if you bring booze, bring the good stuff. It still exists today if you’re looking for a new route and some new friends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThings intensified when she got into CycloCross, a community-oriented dirt (read: mud) race for cyclists. She participated in the Single Speed CycloCross World Championships in 2008, an adventure where she spent more time cheering for others than racing. For her, CycloCross is more about the experience and not taking yourself too seriously — it’s about the process and all of the other humans participating.

For Victor Kernes, the newest UX designer to join the team, getting up to speed was no challenge. “I was able to dive right in on day one because everything was current and lived in Figma.” (Fun fact: Victor taught himself to design by using Figma. Listen to his feature on Design Details Podcast).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs Hatch put it, “The idea that people could be untethered from the desktop environment made the tool easy to adopt.” Anyone can access, comment and participate in design from anywhere, on any machine. But the collaboration feature is what really hooked Hatch:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I like to start a project, get something to a certain state and send the link to our UX Slack channel and ask for help. Within seconds I’ll see cursors jump into the canvas, start duplicating and making improvements. It’s impressive to see your team at work together. It’s like a Figma flash mob.

For example, if a patient is having a health issue, a physician will need to be able to communicate with their patient as quickly as possible through the Virta app. That path has to be predictable and well-known. There cannot be any unexpected left turns in the design and usability. You have to create consistency across everything. If someone is used to one flow, it can’t be different in another part of the app.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I felt like Figma was the future. The collaborative aspect is where our design culture took off.”\u003cbr/\u003eFor Virta, components in Figma are the key to unlocking consistent design. Once an element becomes repeatable, a component is created and UI can easily be duplicated which saves time. Victor explains, “Figma makes the process of replicating design much easier.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver time, the Virta team has made their component library more sophisticated. Based on the idea that if you build a component well, it allows for the desktop and mobile version to to exist in that single component and be responsive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“As a designer who is responsible for creating UI patterns, the one thing I worry about the most is breaking consistent design patterns,” Joey said. “With components in Figma, consistency is created by default.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Virta’s visual component library today, everything is based off a structural component and then the team uses nested components to create new components from that base.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe team is also taking that principle of basing everything off a structural component and applying that to code to bake in even more consistency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"empowering-non-designers\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#empowering-non-designers\"\u003eEmpowering non-designers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith design as the heartbeat of the company, Figma is like the blood supply. Figma files are passing through Slack channels all the time. Marketers are adding copy changes, physicians are providing feedback on prototypes and designers are collaborating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the recent relaunch of VirtaHealth.com, the design team was tasked with reimagining the site in an effort to bring in patients in a more efficient way. Stakeholders included marketing, product, leadership and developers and the entire project took place in Figma — from ideation to developer handoff. “It offered us peace of mind,” recalls Joey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Figma, anyone could see how the project was tracking at any given time. The product team sat with designers during ideation, marketing was able to adjust their own copy and developers were able to move quickly with Figma. That transparency allowed a seemingly big project to get underway fast with their first page going live in just one month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Figma results in us doing more showing rather than telling,” said Dian Xiao, a UX engineer at Virta. “We get better feedback and we can iterate with more up to date information.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eVictor and Alex Tran, UX designers who partner with the marketing team, came up with a self serve-model which helps marketing move faster. Marketing has access to templatized Figma files for social images, landing pages and collateral.

Would this Chrome computer sit on my desk, collecting dust after a day of usage due to my preference for macOS? I’ve been designing with Figma for the previous three years (I was lucky enough to get an alpha invite), so my primary design software was already in the cloud.

If you’ve ever watched someone else’s cursor dance across a frame to tweak a problem spot while you’re filling in copy in that same frame, you know exactly what we’re talking about. In today’s team-oriented digital age, designing with others just feels right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMultiplayer, the nickname for our real-time collaboration, was actually inspired by cooperative multiplayer video games. In other words, from the get-go we strove to instill fun into the design process. This is why two of the use cases we’ve highlighted in this post, games and comics, are mentioned purely for recreational purposes: no KPIs here, not unless you want to measure the decibel of a laugh. The other three methods will help you streamline your workflow and organize convoluted information.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRead on to learn some of the ways we at Figma use our own tool for, well, everything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_1-organize-scattered-ideas-with-affinity-diagrams\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_1-organize-scattered-ideas-with-affinity-diagrams\"\u003e1.

One method of doing this is by creating an affinity diagram, which is when you group similar concepts together into themes. Similar to how a team brainstorms with sticky notes slapped onto a whiteboard, you can organize a team’s ideas digitally with Figma. Multiplayer lets them throw ideas into a file in tandem, and afterwards, allows them to collaboratively group those concepts however makes the most sense. This two-step process helps clarify, prioritize and provide initial structure for larger projects. And it’ll be a godsend for anyone with a Type A personality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_2-vote-on-different-concepts-in-real-time\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_2-vote-on-different-concepts-in-real-time\"\u003e2.

Similar to the design sprint process, teams will vote on examples of a design feature by printing them out and placing stickers on the ones they prefer or find intriguing. The same can be done in Figma, and without having to walk over to your printer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Figma, we do our own version of this. Everyone opens a file of designs at the same time and places circles next to the ones that catch our attention as being especially on brand for the company. Our designers even make sure the colors of the circles are the same as Figma’s logo. It’s because of Multiplayer that the whole team can be in the file at the same time, perusing possible designs, watching cursors dart about and dragging dots to mark favorites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_3-divide-and-conquer-with-a-design-assembly-line\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_3-divide-and-conquer-with-a-design-assembly-line\"\u003e3.

Our vector networks make drawing easy because they offer much more flexibility and control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLouis Harboe and Parker Malachowsky did exactly this during their senior year at USC. They turned one of their class presentations (on AI and healthcare) into a comic to make it easy to understand for a wide range of audiences. They landed on using Figma to work in for its collaborative capabilities. Since the comic will be on the longer side, they created components of speech balloons, caption boxes and image panels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_5-play-games-to-lighten-the-mood\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_5-play-games-to-lighten-the-mood\"\u003e5.

When you want to unwind and bond with your teammates, what’s better than playing a few collaborative games together? In Figma you could play anything from Pictionary, to Bingo, to Tic Tac Toe. Show off your whimsical and creative side to build up a well of good vibes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCase in point: over lunch a few months ago the entire Figma team — at this time there were about 40 of us — designed a sort of “Sim City” together in Figma. Everyone, even the writers with zilch design expertise, was in charge of a square. We dragged components created by Figma designer Rasmus Andersson and plotted out our own little corners of the city.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast week a few of us played the game again during a Figma workshop with Airbnb’s design team, this time pitting two teams against each other and using observation mode to have the “mayors” present their city:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeam 1 had to drop a few 🚒to put out those pesky 🔥from Team 2. 🤣\u003cbr/\u003eHas your team come up with unique ways of collaborating in Figma? \u003cbr/\u003eLet us know!

Its adoption has ensured far more consistent experiences across both Google and non-Google native Android applications. That said, although those experiences excel in usability, they’re less successful at becoming memorable extensions of the brand. There’s drawbacks when everyone leverages the same set of components.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eTheming possibilities in Material Design.

Making a change to a style instantly makes a globalized change across your entire document.

So I created a Material UI kit using Styles to make building Material apps much easier. While this isn’t an official kit or partnership, I think it showcases how well these things work together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaterial Colors\u003c/strong\u003e — I used a fill style for all of the primary and secondary app colors, all levels of emphasis for typography, and a number of swatches for surface colors. Modifying the theme to match your brand’s colors is as easy as picking new colors. I also included a page in the document to access the stock Material palette. Alternatively you can also use Google’s new color tool as a starting point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMaking global color changes to affect multiple components at once.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaterial Type\u003c/strong\u003e—I created text styles for the all of the styles specified in the Material Design spec. By default these are set to \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/roboto-font-pairings/\"\u003eRoboto\u003c/a\u003e, but can be easily redefined to use your brand’s typeface. Changing a style to a different font will instantly propagate the changes across the whole system. Bear in mind, you may need to make some adjustments to type size and spacing in order to fine tune the sizing across the system. As the kit evolves, I plan to include some predefined size recommendations that work for some of the most popular Google fonts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cacc1951d1cf6e837331d7098ee04b5f290956ec-885x663.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;h=502\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cacc1951d1cf6e837331d7098ee04b5f290956ec-885x663.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cacc1951d1cf6e837331d7098ee04b5f290956ec-885x663.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cacc1951d1cf6e837331d7098ee04b5f290956ec-885x663.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cacc1951d1cf6e837331d7098ee04b5f290956ec-885x663.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 885w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSome of the styles defined in the kit.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaterial Elevation\u003c/strong\u003e—I created a library of preset drop shadow styles for all elevations.

This gives users the ability to adjust the size of the cuts or the degree of corner radius for any chosen shape. Then I nested those components within another master component which would become the base for corresponding components in the system. If you decided you wanted to have cut-off corners, it is as simple as toggling the visibility of the correct nested component.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat change is then reflected across the entire system (note: in some cases this will take a few seconds for the change to propagate through hundreds of components).

Styles will simplify your workflow and keep text and layer attributes consistent across all your documents. We took a modular approach, allowing you to apply text, fill, layout grid, effect and stroke styles separately.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese styles will be accessible in your team library, to allow everyone to stay in sync with the most up-to-date versions. You can enable your team’s Styles, and you’ll receive notifications when there are changes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter joining Figma, I worked together with Rasmus, one of our designers, to finalize the interaction model for Styles. Through previous user studies, he and the team surfaced key pain points with using styles in other tools. They honed in on the exact issues I struggled with, and I was excited by their solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we release Figma Styles publicly, we’ll do a deep dive into our approach’s benefits. In the meantime, here’s a glimpse at two of the major pain points it solves:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"pain-point-1-setting-up-text-styles\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#pain-point-1-setting-up-text-styles\"\u003ePain Point 1: Setting up text Styles\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTraditionally, text styles tie form, color and alignment together. If your brand uses a font like Helvetica, you’d need to create Helvetica styles for headers (h1), subheads (h2) and paragraph text (p). If you add a few colors to the mix — for example, to highlight link text — things become exponentially complicated. In most design tools, you can’t separate text and color style, so you must create 9 styles — 3 colors for each of the 3 text formats (and that doesn’t even include text alignment).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf your brand changes — let’s say you realized your ‘light grey’ link color doesn’t pass accessibility tests — you have to manually update all of the styles impacted by that change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe fixed this problem by breaking apart form, color and alignment. All three attributes can be set up (and then used) individually. If your link color changes, simply update the original fill style and it will propagate through your design in all the places where it was used.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"pain-point-2-using-styles-in-text-fields\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#pain-point-2-using-styles-in-text-fields\"\u003ePain point 2: Using Styles in text fields\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverride any part of your text field with a specific style\u003cbr/\u003eIn most design tools, text fields can only hold one style. That means if you want to format part of a sentence as a link, include a section header, or make any other adjustments, you’ll distort the connection between the text field and the originally applied style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Figma, text fields work a little differently. Users can select and apply various text and fill styles inside one text field by highlighting a portion of the text. This will make it easier to add subheads or define sections of the text as links (among other things). They will keep their connection and update when you change the related style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"sign-up-now\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#sign-up-now\"\u003eSign up now\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is a new way of working with styles, and while it might be an adjustment, we believe the rewards will be worth it.

The server was written in TypeScript and, being single-threaded, couldn’t process operations in parallel. That meant a single slow operation would lock up the entire worker until it was complete. A common operation is to encode the document and Figma documents can get very large, so operations would take an arbitrarily-long amount of time. Users connected to that worker would be unable to sync their changes in the meantime.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrowing more hardware at the problem wouldn’t have solved this issue because a single slow operation would still lock up the worker for all files associated with that worker. And we couldn’t just create a separate node.js process for every document because the memory overhead of the JavaScript VM would have been too high. Really only a handful of documents were ever big enough to cause problems, but they were affecting the quality of service for everyone. Our temporary solution was to isolate the crazy documents to a completely separate pool of “heavy” workers:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7cb4c2114a729a419638d4235f01fc1b260a3cf0-800x531.png?rect=0,0,799,531\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=445\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7cb4c2114a729a419638d4235f01fc1b260a3cf0-800x531.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7cb4c2114a729a419638d4235f01fc1b260a3cf0-800x531.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7cb4c2114a729a419638d4235f01fc1b260a3cf0-800x531.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7cb4c2114a729a419638d4235f01fc1b260a3cf0-800x531.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 799w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis kept the service up but meant we had to continually look out for crazy documents and move them over to the heavy worker pool by hand. It bought us enough time to solve these problems for real, which we did by moving the performance-sensitive parts of the multiplayer server into a separate child process. That child process is written in Rust and communicates with its host process using stdin and stdout. It uses so little memory compared to the old system that we can afford to fully parallelize all documents by just using a separate child process per document. And serialization time is now over 10x faster so the service is now acceptably fast even in the worst case.

This guarantees safety but is overly restrictive since the variable may not be needed anymore by the time the mutation happens. Even as someone who has been following Rust from the start, who writes compilers for fun, and who knows how to think like the borrow checker, it’s still frustrating to have to pause your work to solve the little unnecessary borrow checker puzzles that can come up regularly as you work. There are good examples of the problems this creates in \u003ca href=\"https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2016/04/27/non-lexical-lifetimes-introduction/\"\u003ethis blog post\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat we did about it:\u003c/em\u003e We simplified our program to a single event loop that reads data from stdin and writes data to stdout (stderr is used for logging).

This feature shrinks the lifetime of a variable such that it stops after the last time it’s used. Then a pointer will no longer prevent the mutation of the thing it points to for the rest of the scope, which will eliminate many borrow checker false-positives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eErrors are hard to debug\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eError-handling in Rust is intended to be done by returning a value called “Result” that can represent either success or failure. Unlike with exceptions, creating an error value in Rust does not capture a stack trace so any stack traces you get are for the code that reported the error instead of the code that caused the error.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat we did about it:\u003c/em\u003e We ended up converting all errors to strings immediately and then using a macro that includes the line and column of the failure in the string.

One of them is called \u003ca href=\"https://docs.rs/error-chain/*/error_chain/\"\u003eerror-chain\u003c/a\u003e and another one is called \u003ca href=\"https://boats.gitlab.io/failure/\"\u003efailure\u003c/a\u003e.

We tried writing these request handlers in Rust but hit some concerning ergonomic issues around the futures API (Rust’s answer for asynchronous programming). The \u003ca href=\"https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.25/futures/\"\u003efutures API\u003c/a\u003e is very efficient but somewhat complex as a result.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, chaining operations together is done by constructing a giant nested type that represents the whole operation chain. This means everything for that chain can be allocated in a single allocation, but it means that error messages generate long unreadable errors reminiscent of template errors in C++ (an example is \u003ca href=\"https://gist.github.com/evanw/06a672db1897482eadfbbf37ebf9b9ec\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e).

The node.js process creates a separate Rust child process per document and communicates with it using a message-based protocol over stdin and stdout. All network traffic is passed between processes using these messages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow this is being fixed:\u003c/em\u003e The Rust team is hard at work on \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2033-experimental-coroutines.md\"\u003eadding async/await to Rust\u003c/a\u003e, which should solve many of these issues by hiding the complexity of futures underneath the language itself.

One was to have the design for components we generate to live as much in Figma as possible. How amazing would it be to update a design in Figma, and then click a button to sync those design changes to your website? This also means that we need to ensure updating your design doesn’t overwrite any custom code that we have written to make the website or app functional, and that it naturally lends itself to having Figma-generated design code and functional code live separately in neat compartments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second but related goal was to make it easy to attach existing functional code to new designs. For example, in the sorted list example above, it would be nice if we could design a new sorted list and easily attach the code we’d already written to it. In other words, it would be great to have our functional code be \u003cem\u003ereusable\u003c/em\u003e across designs, just like how you might reuse React components.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"from-figma-to-css\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#from-figma-to-css\"\u003eFrom Figma to CSS\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first hurdle to Figma to React was creating React components that look like the designs they represent — otherwise, there’s not much point to any of this.

For example, we could render an image of the entire frame and create a component that just draws that image. This approach is simple but very limited; for example, it’s \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area\"\u003ealmost\u003c/a\u003e impossible to do something interactive here like clicking a button to sort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first hurdle to Figma to React was creating React components that look like the designs they represent — otherwise, there’s not much point to any of this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"use-absolute-layout-to-position-nodes\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#use-absolute-layout-to-position-nodes\"\u003eUse absolute layout to position nodes\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA better approach would be to break the frame down into its constituent pieces, convert each piece into a DOM element like a \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;div\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e or an \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;img\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e, and then compose those DOM elements together. Composing these elements is a process called layout in which we specify where each element should be placed and how it should be sized relative to every other element.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Figma API provides a solid foundation for determining layout. Each node in a document has a property called \u003ccode\u003eabsoluteBoundingBox\u003c/code\u003e. Using \u003ccode\u003eabsoluteBoundingBox\u003c/code\u003e, we can figure out exactly where each node currently lives on the canvas, and how much space it occupies. From this, one idea would be to take each node, render it as an element, and then use CSS absolute positioning to place it on the page. Doing so, we might get something like this (notice that the frame is still stuck to the top left corner):\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?rect=1,0,1199,900\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1199w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis looks pretty much the same as if we had rendered the entire frame as an image, however we’ve already made a lot of progress. We can now select the text in the list, we can potentially replace the text with something dynamic, and we can attach events to clicking on different things in the scene (like the sorting arrows). Despite that, many shortcomings remain. If we add a lot of text to this list item box, the text will spill over outside the rectangle. Looking at these absolute bounds turns out to be too constraining.

This deals with the list container changing size and shape, but not with the list contents themselves changing. For instance, how would we adapt if we wanted to add another list element dynamically, or if the text that goes in that list element exceeds the dimensions of the original box?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"layout-top-down-or-bottom-up\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#layout-top-down-or-bottom-up\"\u003eLayout: top-down or bottom-up?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe problems above happen to be what HTML itself is adept at solving. If you stack two div elements one on top of the other, changing the height of the first div will automatically push the second div down. This behavior doesn’t work in our situation because everything is absolutely positioned, and so they’re locked in place!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStacking divs one atop the other based on how much content is in each one is an approach that we’ll call \u003cem\u003ebottom-up\u003c/em\u003e layout, meaning we start from the lowest building blocks (say, pieces of text) and build up the structure by composing those blocks together to get the shape of the higher level layers. In contrast, what we so far have done is \u003cem\u003etop-down\u003c/em\u003e layout, in which we specify how much space the top-most layer should take up, and then place the elements that make up this higher layer within it. What if we take a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s decide on how we want to react when content within one of our elements changes.

The result is that for any node, we can separate its children elements into three groups:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA group of \u003ccode\u003eTOP\u003c/code\u003e aligned elements, with bottom-up layout\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA group of elements that are \u003ccode\u003eCENTER\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eSCALE\u003c/code\u003e, or \u003ccode\u003eTOP_BOTTOM\u003c/code\u003e aligned, positioned with absolute (or top-down) layout\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA group of \u003ccode\u003eBOTTOM\u003c/code\u003e aligned elements, again with bottom-up layout\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?rect=0,0,1009,806\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=535\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1009w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e3-stack layout\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we apply these ideas to the sortable list, we can now output a fully reactive component that both resizes to fit the container and adapts to changing content within itself, as shown below.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eWrapping and constraints in action\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne thing to point out in this clip is that the footer stops moving at a certain point — in other words, the document stops becoming shorter at a fixed point. This is crucial to ensure that for example the footer doesn’t run into the main content of the component. However, this can’t just be implemented as minimum height on the element: as the text resizes, the minimum height has to grow to accommodate the extra text. The solution here is to add a bottom margin to the top-aligned elements (and a top-margin to the bottom-aligned elements) such that they butt against the opposite end of their parent and “prop” their parent open to a certain size.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"push-out-and-in-at-the-same-time\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#push-out-and-in-at-the-same-time\"\u003ePush out and in at the same time\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, let’s look back at how the bottom-up and top-down constraints interact with one another in the case of the list above. In this next example we highlight three elements that are instrumental in making the list items resize correctly: the containing frame (outer dashed box), the text field (inner dashed box), and the round rectangular border (outlined in solid blue).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=418\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eConstraints visualized\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe relationship between these elements is as follows: the text element and rectangular stage are both children of the frame. The text element has \u003ccode\u003eLEFT_RIGHT\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eTOP\u003c/code\u003e constraints on the frame, and the rectangle has \u003ccode\u003eLEFT_RIGHT\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eTOP_BOTTOM\u003c/code\u003e constraints. As the frame narrows, the text has to squeeze onto a second line, increasing its height. Because its margins remain constant, this causes the containing frame also to enlarge, which causes the next frame in the list to be pushed down. At the same time, because the rectangle (again, in blue) has a \u003ccode\u003eTOP_BOTTOM\u003c/code\u003e constraint to that frame, it too has to resize and become bigger to satisfy that constraint. So we have a bottom-up constraint where the inner text makes the outer frame larger, and then a top-down constraint where the outer frame makes the inner rectangle larger. I really feel like this is one of those interactions where the result is entirely unremarkable (this is exactly the behavior you would expect) but the journey to get there is fairly creative.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"make-the-list-act-like-a-list\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#make-the-list-act-like-a-list\"\u003eMake the list act like a list\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow that we’ve got ourselves something that looks like a list, how do we make this list do list-y things? How can we make it load arbitrary data, for example? Or sort that data?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur React converter will have to spit out some files with React components in them. Every time we change the design, we’ll have to at least change some of the contents of some of these files to represent the changes in the design. In order to make the components \u003cem\u003edo things\u003c/em\u003e we probably want to write some code somewhere that can interact with the generated components. Lastly, the code that we write shouldn’t ever be overwritten by the generator and ideally could be portable from one component to another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou might’ve noticed by now that the previous section on layout doesn’t depend on React at all. You’re right — we could’ve made our converter generate pure HTML and CSS and it would’ve worked just as well so far. That’s because a pure conversion of a Figma frame results in a static component, and React proffers no significant advantages when it comes to rendering a static site besides composability of code.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut now we’ll have to lean in on React more heavily. I’ll introduce just two basic concepts that I conceived of to solve the functionality problem. Their advantage is that they are simple yet surprisingly powerful, but in no way do I imply that these concepts are the only ways to do things — maybe you can offer or implement your own solutions to this problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"gadgets-reusable-code-blobs-that-stick-to-designs\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#gadgets-reusable-code-blobs-that-stick-to-designs\"\u003eGadgets: reusable code blobs that stick to designs\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first concept I want to introduce is that of a Gadget (called “components” in the code). A Gadget is a wrapper that goes around any node in a Figma design and adds a piece of functionality to it — any functionality at all. You can create or attach a Gadget to a Figma node by putting a hash symbol (‘#’) in front of its name.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, if you want to say that a frame should behave like a clock, you could name it \u003ccode\u003e#Clock\u003c/code\u003e. This won’t do anything special in the file itself, but will trigger that node to be Gadgetized in the converter — this will create a Gadget file called \u003ccode\u003eCClock.js\u003c/code\u003e that you can fill in with functionality.

We can wrap each frame in the same Gadget (called \u003ccode\u003e#Spinner\u003c/code\u003e). This will generate a customizable code file \u003ccode\u003eCSpinner.js\u003c/code\u003e.

A variable is simply a text node whose name starts with \u003ccode\u003e$\u003c/code\u003e. Such a node will by default show the text in the design, but can be overridden by React props to show arbitrary text. The property that overrides the text is the same as the name of the node minus the \u003ccode\u003e$\u003c/code\u003e. So as an example, if I have a node called $chicken and props coming into that element looks like \u003ccode\u003e{chicken: \u0026#34;poptarts\u0026#34;}\u003c/code\u003e, then the text of that node will be replaced with the string \u003ccode\u003e\u0026#34;poptarts\u0026#34;\u003c/code\u003e.

C\u003c/strong\u003e, which is true of all Gadget templates generated with the converter. This is to ensure that we can always start with a capital letter which is React convention for component names (another way would be to just capitalize the first letter).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe default to showing what’s in the Figma document if no listItems are provided.\u003c/strong\u003e This is recommended so that the page can function without having to provide any data sources.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe can use Component, which is the node the Gadget is wrapping, multiple times in the render function!\u003c/strong\u003e This is how we can duplicate the list item.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe have to wrap each Component in a div\u003c/strong\u003e. This is to apply the \u003ccode\u003eposition: relative\u003c/code\u003e style, which is necessary in the case of our file. The details of why this is aren’t important, but it’s nice that we can do this. Note that you could just as easily attach a class here and style this in CSS. React in fact discourages inline styles in its style guide. You can imagine implementing a converter that outputs a CSS file without too much additional difficulty.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo why can’t we just load the data source directly in this component? The reason is because we want to create a \u003cem\u003esortable\u003c/em\u003e list, and the controls for sorting are outside of this component. Because the \u003ccode\u003eListItems\u003c/code\u003e component and the buttons to sort ascending and descending are on completely different subtrees, they can only communicate between one another through a common parent. They have to talk through this parent, so we might as well have the parent be responsible for being the canonical source of truth for the list elements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are a number of ways around this. You could easily attach Redux to each component and communicate through actions and the global store. This would also have the advantage of being more maintainable. But for the sake of code simplicity, I’ll show how to achieve the same end result with React only.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"load-custom-data-into-the-list\"\u003e\u003ca

Because one of its ancestors is a \u003ccode\u003eCSortableList\u003c/code\u003e, we’re able to call into the \u003ccode\u003eprops.sortAscending()\u003c/code\u003e function which will cause the state in \u003ccode\u003eCSortableList\u003c/code\u003e to change, triggering a rerender of the \u003ccode\u003eCListItems\u003c/code\u003e Gadget and rearranging the list items therein. Let’s attach all these Gadgets to our original design, create a \u003ccode\u003eCSortableList\u003c/code\u003e component with \u003ccode\u003elistSource\u003c/code\u003e set to \u003ccode\u003e/shapes.json\u003c/code\u003e, and see what happens:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eSorting custom data\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"reuse-of-code\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#reuse-of-code\"\u003eReuse of code\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis particular example is now functional! Even more exciting though is that now that we have this code, it’s easy to attach it to anything that we want to make into a sortable list by naming the nodes in Figma to what we called our Gadgets. We’ve managed to encapsulate functionality into these Gadget files that can be arbitrarily plunked onto any Figma node. Is this the way that interfaces should be built? Probably not exactly. Are there lessons to be learned here and insights that can be gleaned toward advancing how we think about the interaction of design and code?

From style guide generators to Alexa-Echo integrations, people are adapting the API to many workflows.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe wanted to round up some of the coolest projects we’ve seen in the few short weeks since our API launch.

Stick a Figma URL in a website form, and make magic happen (keep in mind these are all 3rd party integrations, so Figma isn’t responsible for permissions’ settings or maintaining the integrations).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_1-figma-pdf-exporter\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_1-figma-pdf-exporter\"\u003e1.

And if you hook your Figma account up to a similar voice activated function, show us what you do with it! It was built by Jon Gold, a Design Technologist at Airbnb.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"integration-inspiration-for-developers\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#integration-inspiration-for-developers\"\u003eIntegration inspiration for developers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre you an engineer wondering where to start with the Figma API? A web-based design API can make it much easier to automate your design-developer handoff. Check out these projects for inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_4-figma-js\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_4-figma-js\"\u003e4. Figma.js\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to an Alexa integration, \u003ca href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/figma-js\"\u003eJon Gold built an unofficial\u003c/a\u003e library for using the Figma API in Javascript. The wrapper will help you get started quickly in building JS integrations with Figma. Jon’s wrapper is already being used for other programs, like an\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/braposo/figma-graphql\"\u003e open-sourced GraphQL\u003c/a\u003e connector that allows people to write GraphQL queries against the Figma API. The GraphQL connector was made by designer-developer \u003ca href=\"https://bernardoraposo.com/\"\u003eBernardo Raposo\u003c/a\u003e with help from \u003ca href=\"https://iamsaravieira.com/\"\u003eSara Vieira\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_5-syncing-figma-designs-to-react-components\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_5-syncing-figma-designs-to-react-components\"\u003e5. Syncing Figma designs to React components\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the API opportunities we are most excited about is the potential for automatically converting Figma to other frameworks. We’re already seeing it: PageDraw introduced a \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/pagedraw/pagedraw-figma-integration-5f99090ec1d4\"\u003eReact integration\u003c/a\u003e for others to use, and Sara Vieira, a front end developer from Portugal, built a \u003ca href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/3qlk2wk3v5\"\u003eway for React components to be rendered directly\u003c/a\u003e from a Figma file using the aforementioned GraphQL connector she worked on (💪).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFlorian Nagel, software engineer at Candis, also created his own Figma →React converter, and he’s working on open-sourcing it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"_6-volvo-car-mobility\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_6-volvo-car-mobility\"\u003e6. Volvo Car Mobility\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo automate asset delivery, the design and development team at Volvo Car Mobility used the Figma API to simplify their workflow. With custom Slack commands, a designer or developer can initiate the process, and behind the scenes a web service creates a new branch in a GitHub repository.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom there, the web service uses the Figma API to export icons in a specific document with export settings for the frames that contain the icons. The user can view the event log and URL for the branch to create the pull request, all within Slack.

You decide to go job hunting in the tech industry. Your website is polished, your work pixel perfect and judging by the amount of emails you received from recruiters, you’re doing a pretty good job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll the necessary steps have been taken, you’re checking off the boxes on your employment to-do list, and everything’s going well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut then comes your first presentation to a company’s hiring committee. Not all organizations require a formal presentation, but it’s become the norm for many. The interview panel usually consists of three to four designers (or ten to twelve depending on the company’s size and reputation), a recruiter, a manager and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou showcase your work for them — explaining everything you have learned, everything that has prepared you for this moment. You dive into the inspiration and rationale for your decisions on an array of designs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut then, you falter. You see everyone’s eyes glaze over as you go on tangents about complicated projects. Towards the end, they ask a ton of questions and then it’s over. You’re left unsure of whether you did a good job and hope for best as the day unfolds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’re not alone —the formal presentation is where most new grads trip in the long race to employment, literally inches before the finish line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m a new grad myself, and part of my role as the Communications Designer at Figma is to be involved in the interview process for incoming design hires. So, in addition to having given my own, I sit in a lot of these presentations and take notes. If you feel stressed about these interviews, I have a couple of suggestions that’ll help you out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_1-start-slow\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_1-start-slow\"\u003e1. Start slow.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA job presentation is a performance of sorts. And like most performances, you shouldn’t start off the bat with props flying and giant musical numbers. Take the time to properly introduce yourself. Remember to state your name, and the type of design you’re good at.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s a lot of blogs out there about the demand for the multi-talented super employee. But as a new grad, you probably haven’t mastered every skill in the creative world. And that’s okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBe clear about what sets you apart. Is it:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTypography\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUX/UI design\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCommunications design\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMotion graphics\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFront end development\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eSomething else? You want the team to walk away with a clear sense of who you are, so don’t be afraid to emphasize your passion in your introduction. Later, you can mention other topics you were exposed to but don’t have expertise in. Eg, data visualization, CSS/HTML, etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, if you’re a seasoned designer with tons of experience, this guidance might not apply to you. General experts should not be afraid to proclaim their broad talents to the room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_2-pick-which-project-you-loved-the-most-not-the\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_2-pick-which-project-you-loved-the-most-not-the\"\u003e2. Pick which project you loved the most, not the one you spent the most time on\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ve noticed that new grads often start their presentations with elaborate projects, as though lengthy walls of text will impress the committee. Then, toward the end they show smaller-scoped projects that they’re far more passionate about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI recommend beginning your presentation with the projects that tap into your inner child — they’re more authentic and playful. They’ll also represent your design sensibilities more accurately, as well as express who you are through your work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"_3-the-dummies-guide-what-who-why-where\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#_3-the-dummies-guide-what-who-why-where\"\u003e3. The Dummies guide — What, Who, Why \u0026amp; Where\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn that same note, give people a watered-down version of the design projects you worked on. The hiring committee doesn’t need to know every twist and turn of how things unfolded — that will just make their heads hurt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead, focus on the bread crumbs: Provide a brief intro, present the problem, lay out the objectives, describe the execution, then reveal the final design and measures of success. Then move on to describing the next project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf they’re interested or want to know more about a particular piece of work, they’ll ask questions. When in doubt, stick with the four W’s:\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"what-is-this-project\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-is-this-project\"\u003eWhat is this project?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust because you wrote a carefully crafted artist statement in your presentation deck doesn’t mean everyone will read it. So, briefly introduce the project in a way, a simpler way. Bear in mind that not every person in the room will understand without context.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"who-worked-on-it\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#who-worked-on-it\"\u003eWho worked on it?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is vital. Distinguish yourself from your teammates by explaining what role you played in the making of the project. Otherwise, employers will be confused as to what you contributed or what you’re capable of.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"why-was-this-project-needed\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#why-was-this-project-needed\"\u003eWhy was this project needed?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnless it’s a personal project, most of the assignments we work on are aimed at a specific problem. Clearly identify that problem and describe it vividly, so your audience identifies with the design challenge. Paint the scene.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"where-is-it-now\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#where-is-it-now\"\u003eWhere is it now?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrack your ideas as they come to life. How did your designs wind up being used? What impact did the project have? Are there metrics you can mention — like amount of signups driven? If your project wasn’t picked up, that’s fine too. Offer a hypothetical vision for what might have happened if it was.

The app connects with Spotify, Apple, and other platforms to allow users to add clips of music to their Instagram photos and stories. You could say social media, and especially social media outreach, is our bread and butter. But I’ll let you in on a little secret: Our metrics weren’t always this high.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I was first hired our Facebook page was more of an afterthought. I’d post a few things here and there, mostly using it as a channel to drive fans back to our Instagram account. We’d only get about 20 likes per post at most and an average reach of about 500 of our 14k page fans. Going into the last quarter of 2017, however, our CEO Rhai Goburdhun asked me to focus on Facebook. Initially we had planned to outsource this to a creative agency. After interviewing quite a few we found out that it would’ve set the company back anywhere from $3k — $5k+ per month — not even including ad spend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=379\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1060w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eExample of a Facebook post with low engagement\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"here-s-the-sitch\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#here-s-the-sitch\"\u003eHere’s the sitch:\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA) We’re operating on a very tight budget.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eB) My time is also split between community management, artist relations, and customer support (startups, amirite?! ;-)).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, like any good startup, we decided to tackle it ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStep one was doing a content analysis of Facebook pages in the music/media/app space (shout out to TV Time and Unilad Sound!), to learn what types of posts had the highest engagement, and then using those findings to put together what types of posts we wanted for Sounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStep two entailed syncing with our designer Thomas to come up with a series of Sounds-branded templates that I could swap out with photos of the artists I was promoting. I assumed these would be Photoshop templates, but he had put everything together in the collaborative interface design tool Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThomas chose Figma because he knew it would be an easy tool for a non-designer to learn, thus perfect for a community manager to create and edit social media content. He explained to me that with other design tools, “the software isn’t always available on both Mac or Windows, it can be expensive to buy a license for casual use, and the UI is difficult to understand. Figma solves a lot of these problems.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“It’s easily understandable for a non-designer, while still being very complete for a designer.” — Thomas Vimare, Lead Designer @ Sounds app\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"she-s-a-figma-niac-that-s-for-sure\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#she-s-a-figma-niac-that-s-for-sure\"\u003eShe’s a Figma-niac That’s For Sure\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe wanted a way to create marketing templates that could be easily edited by someone who doesn’t use design software everyday. As a non-designer who has only dabbled in Photoshop — mostly to troll friends with dumb photos I’d hack together — I initially found Figma’s interface to be a bit daunting. Luckily, Thomas is awesome, and he set up the workspace and templates in a very “Figma For Dummies” way. All it took was one Slack session and a brief screen grab video for me to get the hang of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma quickly became part of my daily social content creation process. I liked that I could now create posts immediately once I was struck by a creative idea, rather than having to wait for Thomas — who’s nine hours ahead of me at Sounds HQ in Paris — to read my Slack message and send something back.

Even with just a tiny bit of ad spend (a max of $25/day split between Facebook and Instagram), I immediately noticed an exponential spike in reach and engagement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of 10–20 likes per post, I started seeing thousands of likes, comments, and shares per post. Our weekly reach started hitting over 1m, which is what our monthly reach used to be. And in less than 4 months, our number of Facebook page likes had quadrupled to 60k as of February 2018. Only a month later, and we’re at over 150k.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo be clear, with Facebook’s feed algorithm we still have to boost posts with a bit of ad spend (usually around $5/post, up to $10 if we see it’s performing really well) to reach our audience. But it’s costing a lot less, we’re seeing more enthusiastic discussions in the comments, and the audience reached with ad spend is sharing to their networks, so our overall organic reach is increasing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we had gone with an agency, we would’ve spent upwards of $20k in the same time frame. Instead, it’s cost a grand total of less than $3k in ad spend. For a lean startup, that sort of difference is huge for us, as it gives us much more budget to put back into other important areas of focus, such as tools that impact user retention and monetization in the app.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?rect=0,0,1399,800\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=383\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"biggest-learnings\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#biggest-learnings\"\u003eBiggest Learnings\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter a few months of experimentation on our Facebook strategy, these are the key takeaways I have that could be helpful to anyone else who’s on a small marketing team and unsure of how to achieve social channel growth:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou don’t need to be a designer to create content.\u003c/strong\u003e With the right tools (in our case, Figma) and a little creativity, having a set of templates optimized for each social channel makes it super easy to churn out daily content.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou don’t need to be a marketer to do marketing\u003c/strong\u003e.

Answering the first question, he defined design as “a plan for arranging elements to accomplish a particular purpose.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis other answers are short, even quippy at times, but when asked about the role of constraint in design, he paused to give the longest and most considered response in the series: “Here is one of the few effective keys to the design problem: the ability of the designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible; his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough I’m not a designer by trade — I’m an engineer who \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/\"\u003eworks on Figma\u003c/a\u003e, the web-based collaborative design tool — it’s easy to see how Eames’ remarks apply to my work as well. Instead of arranging UI elements to make products, I arrange mathematical concepts expressed in code to implement tools and features. And constraints of time, simplicity, maintenance, and even aesthetics play a similarly dominant role in my process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne recent project highlights these parallels exceptionally well. I was tasked with somehow adding support for Apple’s quirkily-named ‘squircle’ shape to Figma — with little else to go on, I got to work doing research.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat unfolded was a mathematical odyssey, fraught with false starts, hidden problems, emergent constraints, exploration, tension and resolution.\u003c/strong\u003e In short, it was a story every designer experiences, at some scale, almost every day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo provide joy to math geeks like me and to illustrate how the design process unfolds when math is the medium, every step is presented below, from square one to shipping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-squircle-smooth-operator\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-squircle-smooth-operator\"\u003eThe squircle: Smooth operator\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy story begins long before I started at Figma, on June 10th, 2013, the day Apple released iOS 7. There was something subtle about the update: the home screen’s app chiclets had a juicier, more organic feel. They’d gone from squares with rounded corners, to \u003cem\u003esquircles\u003c/em\u003e (a portmanteau of ‘square’ and ‘circle’).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat is the difference, you ask? To be fair, it’s slight — A squircle begins as the old rounded square, but with some sandpaper applied to the part where the rounding begins on each side of each corner so the transition from straight to curved is less abrupt.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArticulating this using mathematical language is precise: The curvature of a squircle’s perimeter is continuous, whereas a rounded square’s is not. This may seem trivial, a cool story, but subconsciously it really makes a big impact: a squircle doesn’t look like a square with surgery performed on it; it registers as an entity in its own right, like the shape of a smooth pebble in a riverbed, a unified and elemental whole.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a94289dee2f26a699f56f8f412b7e9370ab21d7-815x450.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=370\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a94289dee2f26a699f56f8f412b7e9370ab21d7-815x450.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a94289dee2f26a699f56f8f412b7e9370ab21d7-815x450.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a94289dee2f26a699f56f8f412b7e9370ab21d7-815x450.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a94289dee2f26a699f56f8f412b7e9370ab21d7-815x450.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 815w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e1.1 — Rounded squares vs squircles: it’s the little things, apparently!\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a long time, industrial designers making physical objects have known how important curvature is to an object’s perception. Try taking a careful look at the corners of a Macbook, or at an old-school, wired earbud case under a desk lamp. Notice how difficult it is to find an orientation where the corners have harshly contrasting highlights.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the result of curvature continuity, and it’s very deliberately included in the design. It’s no surprise that Apple, with fingers uniquely in both the hard and software pies, eventually cross-pollinated their interface designs with industrial ideas by making their icons look like the physical things they produce.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"from-form-to-formula\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#from-form-to-formula\"\u003eFrom form to formula\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOf course, at Figma we love iOS designers, and we feel our users should have the platform elements they need right at their fingertips. In order to give them access to this new shape while designing, we need to find a precise mathematical description so we can start figuring out how to build it into our tool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLuckily, people have been asking this question for as long as iOS 7 has existed, and we are certainly not the first to walk this part of the journey! \u003ca href=\"https://www.cocoanetics.com/2013/06/ios-7-icon-squircle/\"\u003eFundamental initial work\u003c/a\u003e by Marc Edwards included a screenshot that indicated the icon shape was a particular generalization of an ellipse, called a superellipse.

Keeping n = 2 and choosing a = b = 1 describes a perfect unit circle. However, if you choose a value for n that is bigger than two, the result is a superellipse — the rounded elliptical shape starts blending into the shape of its bounding rectangle, with the corners becoming perfectly sharp in the limit that n goes to infinity. Early suggestions tried describing Apple’s shape with n = 5.

Unfortunately, though, \u003ca href=\"https://applypixels.com/the-hunt-for-the-squircle/\"\u003ecareful follow-up efforts\u003c/a\u003e showed that the superellipse formula wasn’t quite right (however, these days true superellipses \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e used as icons in other contexts). In fact, for all choices of n in the equation above, there is a small but systematic discrepancy when compared with the real icon shape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the first blind alley in the story: We have an elegantly simple equation for something that looks a lot like an iOS squircle, but it’s fundamentally incorrect. And we really do owe our users the real thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaking headway requires some serious effort, and again I’m glad to harvest what others have sown. One investigator, Mike Swanson of Juicy Bits, made a hypothesis which builds up the squircles’ corners using a sequence of Bézier curves, \u003ca href=\"https://blog.mikeswanson.com/post/62341902567/unleashing-genetic-algorithms-on-the-ios-7-icon\"\u003ewhich he refined using a genetic algorithm\u003c/a\u003e to optimize similarity with the official Apple shape. The results he obtained turned out to be right on, as proven with Manfred Schwind’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.mani.de/backstage/?p=483\"\u003eexcellent direct approach\u003c/a\u003e, which looks right at the iOS code which generates the icons. So we’ve got two different approaches yielding the same Bézier structure: iOS 7 Squircles were cracked and double checked by others, and we didn’t even have to calculate anything!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-spanner-in-the-works\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-spanner-in-the-works\"\u003eA spanner in the works\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo important details remain, preventing us from cloning the shape directly into Figma and moving on:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, there is the surprising fact that the iOS version of the formula (at least at the time of investigation) was found to have some quirks — the corners aren’t exactly symmetrical, and one side has a minuscule straight segment which clearly doesn’t belong. We don’t want that because it complicates both code and tests, but removing the extra segment is easily handled by just mirroring the bug-free half of the corner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, when flattening the aspect ratio of the real iOS rectangle shape, it abruptly changes from the squircle we’re focusing on to a totally different sort shape. This would be unpleasant for a designer, and takes a strong point of view about what shapes ‘should’ be used under certain circumstances.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most natural and useful behavior when flattening a squircle is for the smoothing to gradually disappear until there’s no room left to “sand” the transition between the round and the straight parts of the corner. Flattening even further should reduce the rounded section’s corner radius, which is in line with how Figma behaves today. The Apple squircle formula is of little help to us here, because its smoothing is done in a fixed way: it gives no indication for how to get nearer to or further from the old rounded rectangle. What we really need is a \u003cem\u003eparametrizable\u003c/em\u003e smoothing scheme, where some particular value of the parameter corresponds very closely to the Apple shape.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs an added bonus, if we can parametrize the smoothing process that transforms a rounded square into a squircle, we can likely apply the same process to other places where corner rounding happens in Figma: stars, polygons, and even corners in arbitrary vector networks drawn with the pen tool. Despite the complication, this is beginning to look like a much more complete and valuable feature than simply adding support for iOS 7 squircles would have been. We are now giving designers an infinite variety of new shapes to use in many situations, and one of them happens to correspond to the squircle icon shape that got us started in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRequiring that our squircle smoothing scheme be continuously adjustable yet conform to the iOS 7 shape at some comfortable point its adjustible range is the first emergent constraint in our story, and it’s a difficult one to satisfy. An analogous task would be for a dancer to take a single still image of a ballerina in mid-flight, then design a leap in such a way that a movie of her executing it reproduces the image exactly at a precise point in time. Which sounds freaking hard. So maybe some calculation will be necessary after all?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore diving into parameterizing squircles, let’s take a step back and dust off some formal tools that will help us analyze what’s going on. First of all, we need to settle on \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e we’ll describe a squircle. When discussing superellipses before, we used an equation involving x and y, where all the points (x, y) in the plane which satisfy the equation implicitly trace out the superellipse. This is elegant when the equation is simple, but real squircles are a patchwork of Bézier curves spliced together, which leads to unmanageably messy implicit equations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe can deal with this complication by using a more explicit approach: take a single variable t, restrict it to a finite interval, and map each value which t can take on that interval to a distinct point on the squircle perimeter (Bézier curves themselves are almost always represented this way, in fact). If we concentrate on just one of the corners, thereby restricting our analysis to a curved line with a clear beginning and end, we can choose the mapping between t and the corner such that t = 0 corresponds to the beginning of the line, t = 1 corresponds to the end of the line, and smoothly sliding t between 0 to 1 smoothly traces out the round part of the corner. In mathematical language, we will describe our corner by the path r(t), which is structured as\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/85024a496d4e1ebf10397c94a2a338c56ad343df-317x23.png?rect=1,0,314,23\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=49\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/85024a496d4e1ebf10397c94a2a338c56ad343df-317x23.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 314w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e4.1 — Plane curve bijection with [0,1]\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003ewhere x(t) and y(t) are separate functions of t for the x and y components of r.

Though it may look a bit complicated, curvature has a straightforward geometric construction, originally due to Cauchy:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe center of curvature C at any point P along the curve lies at the intersection of the line normal to the curve at P and another normal line taken infinitesimally close to P. (As a side note, the circle centered at C as constructed above is called the \u003cem\u003eosculating circle\u003c/em\u003e at P, from the Latin verb \u003cem\u003eosculare\u003c/em\u003e, meaning ‘to kiss’. 😙 Isn’t that great?)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe radius of curvature R is the distance between C and P.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe curvature κ is the inverse of R.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs constructed above, the curvature κ is nonnegative and doesn’t distinguish between rightward and leftward turns. Since we do care about this, we form the signed curvature k from κ by assigning a positive sign if the path is turning right, and a negative sign if the path is turning left. This concept too has an analogue in the car picture: at any point t, the signed curvature k(t) is just the angle through which the steering wheel has been turned at time t, with plus signs used for turns to the right and minus signs for turns to the left.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"geometry-is-king-arc-length-parametrization\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#geometry-is-king-arc-length-parametrization\"\u003eGeometry is king: Arc length parametrization\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith curvature introduced, we have a last couple wrinkles to iron out. First, consider for a moment two cars driving along a squircle corner shaped route; one car keeps speeding up and then braking the entire way (🤢), while the other car smoothly speeds up then coasts down to a halt at the end. These two different ways of driving will yield very different path histories even though the exact same route was taken. We only care about the shape of the corner, not how any one driver negotiated it — so how can we separate the two? The key is to use not time to label the points in the history, but rather the cumulative distance traveled, or arc length. So instead of answering questions like ‘where was the car ten minutes into its trip?’, we’d rather answer ‘where was the car ten \u003cem\u003emiles\u003c/em\u003e into its trip?’. This way of describing paths, the arc length parameterization, captures their geometry alone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we have some path history r(t) in hand, we can always extract the arc length s as a function of t from the path by integrating its speed, as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40ae31e45ffbe7f6b24d46323c1761af4f20ce6a-183x53.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=194\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40ae31e45ffbe7f6b24d46323c1761af4f20ce6a-183x53.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 183w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e5.1 — Arc length integral\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf we can invert this relationship to find t(s), then we can substitute this for t in our path history r(t) to get the desired arc length parameterization r(s). The arc length parameterization of a path is equivalent to a path history made by a car driving at unit speed, so unsurprisingly the velocity v(s) is always a unit vector, and the acceleration a(s) is always perpendicular to the velocity.

Curvature is, after all, a purely geometric quantity, so it’s really pleasing to see it look simple in the geometric parameterization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"design-the-curvature-compute-the-curve\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#design-the-curvature-compute-the-curve\"\u003eDesign the curvature, compute the curve\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow for the other wrinkle: we’ve just seen how to go from a path-history description of a curve r(t) to its arc length parameterization r(s), and how to extract the signed curvature k(s) from it. But can we do the reverse? Can we design a curvature profile and from it derive the parent curve? Let’s consider the car analogy again — suppose that as we were driving at constant unit speed along a route, we recorded the position of the steering wheel continuously throughout the journey. If we took that steering data and gave it later to another driver, they’d be able to reconstruct the route perfectly, so long as they played back the steering wheel positions properly and drove exactly the same speed. So we see intuitively that we have enough information to reconstruct the parent curve, but how does the computation look mathematically? It’s a little bit hairy, but it’s still possible, thanks to Euler, using the arc length parameterization — if we choose a coordinate system such that the curve starts at the origin and has its initial heading directed along the x axis, then x(s) and y(s) can be reconstructed from k(s) as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a766e50995a65ac0d3830ba14cb16bc63bbe08e-340x133.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=262\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a766e50995a65ac0d3830ba14cb16bc63bbe08e-340x133.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a766e50995a65ac0d3830ba14cb16bc63bbe08e-340x133.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e6.1 — Recovering a curve from its curvature\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast, note the argument of the sine and cosine functions above: it is the integral of the signed curvature.

As we’ll see later, there’s a tradeoff between having a smooth curvature plot and having a small number of Bézier curves, and the iOS corner only uses three. Generally, designers would rather deal with fewer Bézier curves at the expense of having a mathematically perfect curvature profile. These details aside, we can kind of squint at the plot on the right and see a general picture emerge: the curvature ramps up, flattens in the middle, and then ramps back down.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"breakthrough-smoothing-parameterized\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#breakthrough-smoothing-parameterized\"\u003eBreakthrough: Smoothing parameterized\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBingo! In that last observation lies the key to how we can parameterize the smoothing of our squircle corner. At zero smoothing, we want a curvature profile like the rounded rectangle: tabletop shaped. As smoothing slowly increases, we want the height of the tabletop to stay fixed while its cliff edges start turning into steep slopes, yielding an isosceles trapezoidal curvature profile (still with a total area of π/2, of course). As smoothing approaches its maximum, we want the flat part of the trapezoid to disappear, leaving us with a broad isosceles triangular profile whose peak height is that of the original tabletop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2648862f95a51661e06d454f7d1ff833640e7321-800x500.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=419\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2648862f95a51661e06d454f7d1ff833640e7321-800x500.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2648862f95a51661e06d454f7d1ff833640e7321-800x500.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2648862f95a51661e06d454f7d1ff833640e7321-800x500.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2648862f95a51661e06d454f7d1ff833640e7321-800x500.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 800w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e8.1 — Curvature profiles for various values of the smoothing parameter\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s try to express this sketch of a curvature profile in mathematical terms, using ξ as a smoothing parameter which varies between zero and one.

Here is the curvature analysis performed for a clothoid squircle corner with ξ = 0.4:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/780841cb11400392daf7cb5d1b51926d8716bd41-1000x500.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=335\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/780841cb11400392daf7cb5d1b51926d8716bd41-1000x500.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/780841cb11400392daf7cb5d1b51926d8716bd41-1000x500.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/780841cb11400392daf7cb5d1b51926d8716bd41-1000x500.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/780841cb11400392daf7cb5d1b51926d8716bd41-1000x500.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1000w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e9.2 — Squircle corner at ξ = 0.4 using ninth-order clothoids and circular arcs\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough it feels good to have obtained this elegant shape, we must realize this is only an ideal version. This exact shape won’t work for several reasons, first among which is the fact that the center of curvature of the circular portion moves as a function of the smoothing parameter ξ — ideally, it would remain fixed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMore importantly, the power of the arc length s in the terms we’ve kept to produce the plots can be as high as nine. In Figma, continuous paths must be representable by cubic Bézier curves (of which quadratic Bézier curves and lines are special cases) and this limits us to keeping only cubic and lower order terms. This means that the series above for x(s) and y(s) must each be truncated to a single term. It’s hard to have much confidence that such a drastic truncation will retain the properties we like.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSadly, discarding higher-order terms is not sufficient — the resulting construction performs very poorly when ξ is large.

It seems three orders isn’t enough to keep the curvature increasing throughout the ramp up and ramp down sections of the parameterization, meaning that we have a ton of accumulated error by the time we get to the circular section. Sadly, this means that all of our clothoid results are unusable, and we have to go back to the drawing board.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"nothing-gold-can-stay\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#nothing-gold-can-stay\"\u003eNothing gold can stay\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s take a step back, consider our constraints again, and try to extract what we can from the previous efforts before heading off in a new direction.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, we know that the perfect clothoid construction has exactly the curvature profile we need, but the center of curvature of the central circular section changes location as a function of the smoothing parameter ξ. This is undesirable because our current on-canvas rectangle rounding UI uses a dot right at the center of curvature which a user can drag to set the corner radius. It might feel a bit weird if that dot moved as the smoothing varied. Also, the iOS shape’s central section is right where it would be if it were just a rounded rectangle, further implying total independence of the center’s location from ξ. So we can keep the same basic curvature design goal and add the constraint that the circular section keep a fixed center of curvature as ξ varies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSecond, we know that designers don’t want the construction of the squircle corner to be too complicated. Apple’s squircle (after removing the weird tiny straight part) has only one Bézier curve connecting its circular section to the incoming edge, so maybe we can construct the same type of thing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThirdly, we have a somewhat arcane technical constraint which isn’t apparent at the outset, but that becomes a major implementation issue. To approach this, let’s consider a square, 100px by 100px, which has vanilla corner rounding applied for a corner radius of 20px. This means that each side of the square’s perimeter has 60px of straight track. If we flatten the square into a squashed rectangle so that it’s 80px by 100px, then the straight section of the short side will be only 40px long. What happens when we flatten the square so much that we run out of straight section? Or if we flatten it more, so that the rectangle is, say, 20px by 100px? Figma’s present behavior is to figure out the largest value of corner rounding we have room to apply and then draw the shape using that instead. Our 20px by 100px rectangle would thus have 10px of rounding applied.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf smoothing corners with radius R and parameter ξ consumes p pixels, then the function p(R,ξ) must be invertible to ξ(R,p).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eAny smoothing process we might use to create a squircle will eat up even more of the straight edge than simple rounding does. Imagine the case above again, a 100px by 100px rectangle, apply 20px of rounding, and then apply some smoothing procedure which removes 12 more pixels from the straight sides. This leaves us with a 36px budget in the straight section for flattening. What happens when flattening the rectangle to 60px by 100px? It seems almost obvious, by analogy, that we should back off the smoothing until the budget is balanced and the straight portion is exactly consumed. But how do we compute the value of ξ which satisfies a specific pixel consumption budget? We must be able to do this quickly or we can’t implement the feature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAgain, this problem has a very precise mathematical articulation: If smoothing corners with radius R and parameter ξ consumes p pixels, then the function p(R,ξ) must be invertible to ξ(R,p). This is a somewhat hidden constraint which would also have ruled out a high order clothoid series solution.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, we have a usability constraint, which is that changing the smoothing should actually do something perceptible to the shape. If we yank the smoothing parameter ξ back and forth between zero and one, it better make a visible difference! Imagine we did all this work for something that people can barely see — it’s unacceptable. This is fundamentally a requirement of usefulness, and as such it’s obviously the strongest constraint.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"keep-it-simple-squircle\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#keep-it-simple-squircle\"\u003eKeep it simple, squircle\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s try the most direct thing we can think of that meets the constraints listed above and just try to pick a single parameterized Bézier curve that takes the circular portion and links it up to the straight side.

The curves look attractive, sanded in a way. However the curvature profile looks pretty rough. If we could just make it a bit less spiky, it might be a serious contender for a product.

Rather than splitting the difference evenly between a and b as we did above, why don’t we give two thirds of the interval to a and the remaining third to b? This will throttle the curvature from increasing too quickly, reducing the long tails on the curvature profile and cutting at the spikes.

Something I see borne out repeatedly in this story is the power and effectiveness of trying the simplest possible thing. Doing so will, in the worst case, give a baseline for comparison if the simplest thing ends up not working out. Evaluating it in a serious way also shines a light on the most important things we need to consider when refining the approach and moving forward. And in the best cases, like ours, the simplest thing happens to be pretty good already!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, there is a meditation on the difference between a good product and a perfect one. I feel some pangs of embarrassment writing this that I was unable to come up with a better curvature profile. I’m sure I could have given more time — there are many avenues left to explore. Intellectually, it’s somewhat unsatisfying to have gotten such a beautiful result as the clothoid series but not to have been able to at least see a reflection of that in the spline we shipped in the end. But there’s also the wider context — the constraints of time when working at a small company are very real — and a design which violates these cannot be considered good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

The reason? Design traditionally takes place in a world of siloed, offline desktop software, whereas Figma lives online where everything is connected.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy harnessing the open nature of the web, our API lays the foundation for unique forms of design collaboration. Companies are already using it to craft custom tools that meet their unique needs. For example, Uber created a live feed of what their design team is working on to raise visibility across the organization. GitHub automated part of their icon creation process to improve its efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur API lays the foundation for unique forms of design collaboration\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThose ideas are just the beginning — we’re open sourcing a number of demo projects ranging from a Figma spell checker to a generative art tool to a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMUngXFXQY\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\"\u003emethod for putting your designs\u003c/a\u003e on the Ethereum blockchain.

Unlike our desktop competitors, Figma’s Web API isn’t tied to operating systems, specific file paths or versions of design software.

You can also ping an endpoint to generate a JPG, PNG or SVG of any file or file subtree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve designed the API to be as ergonomic as possible so it’s fast and easy to script improvements to internal company workflows or integrate Figma with other tools. Because it’s web-based, you don’t need to learn esoteric scripting languages to do this. You can rely on the programming frameworks you’re familiar with and interface directly with a well defined web API rather than bind yourself unnecessarily to another proprietary plugin framework. (This will make it easier to keep integrations up to date — and therefore less buggy!)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe know you’re wondering what’s coming up soon.

That said, we have watched as our competitors added extension models which granted developers freedom at the expense of quality, robustness and predictability. We’re eager to leverage the incredible collective brainpower of the Figma community in making our tool better, but we’re not going to introduce extensions until we are confident our extension model is robust. There’s no ETA just yet, but we are actively exploring how to build this in a solid way.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"take-workflow-inspiration-from-uber-github\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#take-workflow-inspiration-from-uber-github\"\u003eTake workflow inspiration from: Uber \u0026amp; GitHub\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs design plays a growing role at big companies, more and more departments touch it.

Traditional desktop design tools weren’t built for collaboration, so it’s painful for people to work together on designs. Files must be exported and uploaded before they can be shared, and thus they’re immediately out of date when the original design changes. Leaders can’t easily see and comment on real-time work; engineers spend hours hunting down the right assets; teams wrestle with problems that — unbeknownst to them — many others solved in previous contexts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor true collaboration at scale, enterprises need a better way to share, search and see real-time designs across the entire organization.

When someone needs to alter an icon, they can simply edit the Figma file, which serves as the source of truth. A designer or engineer can then submit a pull request with a reference to the updated Figma design. This triggers a new build via Travis CI which uses Figma’s API to automatically extract icons from the Figma file and publishes the updated icon set in each format.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDriving the changes from a single design file reduces the barrier for contributing said changes.

To access version history, they must use friction-filled workarounds and export files.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s not the case with Figma. Because our tool is web based, your files are constantly saved, and you never have to sync. This continuous stream of version history is great for tracking your progress.

You can manually flag particular versions and save notes about each stage of design as you go.

Engineers, marketers, project managers, and other stakeholders collaborate until the best product emerges. To do this efficiently, teams rely on prototypes — high-fidelity representations of an app — to communicate about a mockup before it’s shipped to engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe feel of an app can be completely changed by something as fundamental as the animation between frames. Without those details in place, stakeholders are at risk of becoming thrashed with incessant back and forth. Who has time for that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"learn-how-to-prototype-in-figma-with-these-two\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#learn-how-to-prototype-in-figma-with-these-two\"\u003eLearn how to prototype in Figma with these two videos\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s why we’re excited about today’s news: We’re introducing transitions for Figma prototyping. As you build a clickable prototype of your design, add a \u003cstrong\u003edissolve, slide, or push\u003c/strong\u003e effect to link frames to each other. This will make the prototype’s transitions feel more realistic to the viewer, whether that person is a developer, prospective client, or a relative who still doesn’t understand what you actually do for a living.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWant to “slide” from one frame to the next over a duration of a few milliseconds?

Handled.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese transitions are essential for getting your ideas across, and you have been clamoring for them with a flood of feedback via Spectrum and Twitter. Our community has requested this functionality nonstop since we first announced Figma 2.0 with prototyping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we promised back then, we will continue to build prototyping in Figma to meet the needs of everyone involved in the software development process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-makes-figma-prototyping-faster-and-easier\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-makes-figma-prototyping-faster-and-easier\"\u003eWhat makes Figma prototyping faster and easier?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor the unfamiliar, Figma prototyping has super powers that other tools lack (💪).\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLive design\u003c/strong\u003e: Because we’re a web-based platform, your prototypes automatically stay up to date.

It’s Figma TED talk— allowing you to casually walk around the room guiding the demo from your phone. This is particularly useful during client meetings. Stakeholders can click your avatar in the Figma prototype (observation mode), then follow along with your design flow from their own laptops.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComponents + prototyping\u003c/strong\u003e: Use Figma components in your prototypes to save a ton of time. When you set a navigation from a component once, it will automatically populate through all instances. For example, your home button will always bounce you back to your home screen.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the existing prototyping features, we hope our new transitions will add an extra layer of polish to your work. You can choose the duration of the animation, and play around with how one frame will ease into another. This means you have control over when an animation is slightly faster at the beginning, or at the end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, the prototyping toolbar has a preview box, so designing the transitions between frames is a snap. (Or a slide.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBe sure to check out this video to learn the basics of prototyping in Figma.

Meanwhile, all feedback, changes, and updates were stored and remained in sync.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“By far, Figma offers the best workflow among the current UI design tools, especially when combined with prototyping and commenting,” said Lubos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMilosz Bazela, COO and Head of Xfive, especially liked the ability to view and comment on mockups within the browser. “Thanks to Figma, it was easy for everybody — from marketing managers to copy writers — to access designs at all stages of development and to provide very specific feedback,” said Milosz.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=549\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eNumber of comments pertaining to revised pages in Figma.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"streamlining-designer-developer-workflow\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#streamlining-designer-developer-workflow\"\u003eStreamlining designer-developer workflow\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce comps were approved, it was time for the designer-developer handoff. “Figma works great for designer-developer collaboration and, during this project, it really proved itself,” said Lubos.

Open design represents a cultural shift, from design siloes to collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, here to offer some pro tips on the transition is \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/moreofmorris?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"\u003eJames Morris\u003c/a\u003e, senior designer at the popular social media management app \u003ca href=\"https://buffer.com/\"\u003eBuffer\u003c/a\u003e. James took a step-by-step approach to moving Buffer to Figma, making sure he had company-wide support for the change. Buffer’s team is entirely remote, so they needed a design tool that simplified communication.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut for James, introducing Figma was about more than just a new tool. It was about shifting design’s role in the engineering-driven organization. “How can you help the design team have a place at the table by default?” he said. “How can you make design part of the discussion?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"buffer-s-commitment-to-transparency\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#buffer-s-commitment-to-transparency\"\u003eBuffer\u0026#39;s commitment to transparency\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not surprising Buffer was drawn to Figma, because a core tenet of its culture is transparency — to the point that the company publishes all its employees’ salaries online. Despite that, its design team struggled to work with other departments, according to James. The tools they used trapped them in a separate world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMembers of other teams had trouble finding the designs they were looking for, since files were often buried deep in Dropbox subfolders. Once they located them, they couldn’t see designs without buying the software that powered them, or upgrading to new versions. Even with the right license, developers and product managers were often afraid to open designs in case they accidentally saved over someone’s work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“You realize the tool of choice really has a massive effect on the communication. It puts a wall up around the design team as though it has these special files no one can touch,” James said. “Figma promotes the opposite feeling. We’re there just a tap away.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76926dbbe3e7c736085c3e696d5d4520dd3cde7f-800x509.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=426\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76926dbbe3e7c736085c3e696d5d4520dd3cde7f-800x509.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76926dbbe3e7c736085c3e696d5d4520dd3cde7f-800x509.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76926dbbe3e7c736085c3e696d5d4520dd3cde7f-800x509.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76926dbbe3e7c736085c3e696d5d4520dd3cde7f-800x509.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 800w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eBuffer file structure in Figma\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe explained that because Figma runs in the cloud, the collaboration issues disappear. Anyone can be given access to a design file via its URL, and teams can have unlimited view-only accounts (that are free!), where viewers can leave comments and pull data from designs to code them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We have engineers who are using Linux and much of the design software out there doesn’t support this platform,” James said. “One person was prepared to buy a Mac just so he could open design files!

He knew the best way to rally support was to show, not tell. With a company wide email, he introduced a ‘period of exploration,’ asking teams to experiment with different design and collaboration tools to see what met their needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring this time, James took in feedback about Buffer’s workflow challenges and solutions. He lobbied for the ways Figma could fix these issues, including detailing the benefits in the original memo he sent out. Ultimately, James trusted that once people tried Figma, the collaboration features would prove themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"step-2---show-don-t-tell\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#step-2---show-don-t-tell\"\u003eStep 2 - show, don\u0026#39;t tell\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"whiteboarding-sessions-with-product-managers\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#whiteboarding-sessions-with-product-managers\"\u003eWhiteboarding sessions with product managers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring this exploration period, James used creative methods to help teams and individuals explore Figma. Since Buffer is remote, an easy first step was virtual whiteboarding. James is based in England, so he convinced one of Buffer’s Canadian PMs to brainstorm a feature with him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We both drew different ideas, like how people would collaborate in a Google Doc, except with shapes instead of words,” James said. “Figma showed itself very quickly, it’s incredibly easy to pick up.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause they used Figma to work together in real-time, James didn’t have to sit around waiting for a formal spec sheet from the PM.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?rect=0,0,1600,1065\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=446\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eJames Morris, Buffer Senior Designer\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"convincing-the-engineers\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#convincing-the-engineers\"\u003eConvincing the engineers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo persuade Buffer’s developers to get on board, James left them to their own devices. “I said, ‘Guys, check this out.

Eventually, Lobanovskiy got fed up, went searching for an alternative, and found Figma, an all-in-one design, prototyping, and developer handoff tool. Because it runs in the cloud, teams can share always up-to-date designs, collect comments, and give file attributes to engineers, simply by sending a URL. Any person with any type of computer can access the designs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We absolutely fell in love,” Lobanovskiy remembered. “It immediately removed this hassle of versioning, collaboration and feedback.

The word “hackathon” first surfaced in 1999, at a bug bashing party for an operating system and then at a Sun conference for PalmPilot engineers. These dev-heavy events paved the road for the hackathons that came after, solidifying them as the coder’s domain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it’s been a few decades since 1999 and times have changed. Coding isn’t the sole competitive advantage it once was for tech companies, and design has become a key differentiator for products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLikewise, the isolated reign of the hackathon-engineer is coming to a close. As design grows in importance to Silicon Valley, college hackathon organizers are looking for new ways to bring UX/UI tracks into their events. They want to give aspiring designers and engineers the chance to work together — the way they would in an actual career setting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want more designers at your hackathon and don’t know where to start, you’re in the right place. Schools often ask Figma for advice on this topic since we’re a collaborative design company, so we gathered pro tips from an organization we really admire: Hack@Brown.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHack@Brown is the major annual hackathon hosted by Brown University, with upwards of 500 participants. To draw in the artistic crowd, they experimented with new tactics for years and by 2017, ⅕ of all their attendees were designers.

They run in different circles than engineers, so you’ll have to tap your network and do some digging to furrow them out. Contact your school’s art department to find out if there’s a Facebook group or flyer board you can post on. Research local design and art schools in the area and invite their students to join the hackathon.

But they also contacted Parsons in New York City and Northeastern, which has a design club called Scout. A few Scout students agreed to attend Hack@Brown in the early years, but that was about it. “It was much harder to get designers to come then,” former Hack@Brown organizer Atty Eleti remembers. “There was less awareness of hackathons.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"step-2-woo-them\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#step-2-woo-them\"\u003eStep 2 — Woo them\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d343b00fd535cd121b4d71f64061fc46b2553e62-1000x606.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=406\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d343b00fd535cd121b4d71f64061fc46b2553e62-1000x606.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d343b00fd535cd121b4d71f64061fc46b2553e62-1000x606.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d343b00fd535cd121b4d71f64061fc46b2553e62-1000x606.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d343b00fd535cd121b4d71f64061fc46b2553e62-1000x606.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1000w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust finding designers isn’t enough.

With Hack@Brown, Eleti and his team changed the text on flyers from the traditional “24 hours, $20,000 in prizes” to focusing on the team building and creative aspects of the event with the tagline “Make, play, learn.” They believed the more inclusive language would help convince designers that they could contribute to a hackathon team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"step-3-check-your-application-process\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#step-3-check-your-application-process\"\u003eStep 3 — Check your application process\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ac68d6ce54410e0be8dd789271caa0e655b1c6c4-1000x606.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=406\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ac68d6ce54410e0be8dd789271caa0e655b1c6c4-1000x606.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ac68d6ce54410e0be8dd789271caa0e655b1c6c4-1000x606.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ac68d6ce54410e0be8dd789271caa0e655b1c6c4-1000x606.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ac68d6ce54410e0be8dd789271caa0e655b1c6c4-1000x606.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1000w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf your hackathon chooses participants via applications, make sure you’re not subconsciously weeding out designers (or other candidates from unique backgrounds).

Make sure you have design experts helping judge applications.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce Hack@Brown grew big enough, the organizers used a lottery system to ensure the representation of different types of groups (they typically receive 3,000 applications for 500 slots). They accept at least 15 percent designers compared to engineers, but also at least 50 percent women, 20–30 percent people who’d never attended a hackathon before, and other traits.

That can take a lot of forms, but here’s a quick list:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHost design workshops during or leading up to the event to either teach students how to best incorporate design into their hackathon process or to give them a basic overview of the UX/UI design world.\u003cbr/\u003eConsider hosting a mixer for designers during the hackathon in the evening so they can meet fellow designers at the event and feel a little less like lost sheep brought to the slaughter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBring in design mentors from tech companies to give advice to teams.

He explained in order to succeed at scale, design teams must have a design system. Larger, long-term projects need constraints and consistency across platforms. With principles like unified, universal, iconic and conversational in his arsenal, he set out to form a design system for Airbnb, documenting the process for all to see.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut yesterday’s digital maelstrom allowed for a public tête-à-tête between him and other thought leaders, including Sean Blanton, a Product Designer at Facebook. While it is literally Saarinen’s job to define the subject, it’s fascinating to watch the concept solidify in real-time and whittled down to its true core by designers both new and experienced. Below are some of the more illuminating tweets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt just 16 words, Saarinen’s first tweet was the skeleton key for design systems: “set of shared and integrated principles and patterns that define the overall design of a product.” He then went on to define or extrapolate on several of those words. Patterns could be patterns and/or components. The design of the product refers to how the end product feels and looks. And so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThen Sean Blanton jumped in, remarking on the shortcomings of language and how that can lead to a smashed beehive of expectations. If we can’t agree on definitions for seemingly simple words, how can we build a consistent framework? Blanton advised, “Always pay attention to the words you’d tend to never look up in the dictionary.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Figma, we’re doing our best to address the obstacles design teams face when creating a design system. Our recent release of Team Library 1.0 empowers teams to create, use and maintain design systems through elevated organization, component documentation, an advanced search system and an intuitive UI redesign.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd while I’m still dancing on my own digital soapbox, Twitter could learn something from the beauty of design constraints too, what with their recent pivot to 280-characters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

We introduced the beta version in February, and since then we’ve talked to hundreds of people about how they’re adopting it. We evolved the functionality based on feedback, and with today’s launch, we hope to make it easier for a wide range of teams to build their own design systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eComponents — buttons, icons, dialogs and whathaveyou — play a crucial role in many companies’ design systems. Organizations need the ability to share these elements widely across files and with team members. That way everyone can design in a structured manner and stay up-to-date with projects. Several companies have even gone to the extreme of developing their own tooling for this part of their design system. For instance, Airbnb and Facebook have hired experts to maintain and create such internal software.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe believe component sharing is key to design at scale, so we prioritized it in our product roadmap and released our Team Library beta way back in February. That was mere months after Figma launched to the public. Since then, many companies have used the feature to design in more consistent and efficient ways, and their insights helped guide our development process for the 1.0 version.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince Figma is online and centralized, we believe we’re uniquely suited to help teams systematize their design. All projects and documents stay up to date in one place without exporting, syncing or sharing. A Figma Team Library is a single source of truth, forming the key foundation for a stable and living design system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"with-figma-you-can-stop\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#with-figma-you-can-stop\"\u003eWith Figma you can stop:\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSyncing with third-party cloud services just to use your team’s component library\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePraying nothing goes wrong with all the tools you’ve hacked together to use your company’s design system\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHunting down the right component like you’re starring in the world’s worst detective series\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you publish or make changes to a shared component in Figma, you can trust that everyone instantly sees the new component in the Team Library.

You stop exhaustively uploading design PNGs that went out of date as soon as you exported them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Software teams constantly struggle with knowing where to find the latest designs,” said Bryant Lee, Head of Product Partnerships and Integrations at Atlassian. “We’re excited to team up with Figma, and believe their live embed capability with Jira Software and Trello will streamline communication between designers and developers.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is just the beginning of the integrations we hope to power at Figma. Since we’re the only design tool that runs on the web, we have a unique opportunity to introduce Live Embeds to different workflows. As you may have seen, our Atlassian feature mirrors a similar capability we recently launched with Dropbox Paper. In the future, you’ll find us wherever designers and their teams need us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo get started, just enable the Figma integration in Atlassian’s marketplace for Jira Software and paste the URL in the design section of a Jira ticket. In Trello, you can turn on Figma as a Power-Up for your team, and then you can add a Figma URL as a Trello card attachment. We have help content on the Jira embed process here and Trello embed here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet us know what you think of the new technology — we’d love to hear how Live Embed changes your workflow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

Since our public launch in September we have received a ton of requests for emoji support, to the point where some teams even left Figma in protest (I kid you not).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt actually took us awhile to figure out teams were churning due to lack of emoji support. Much like seeing the 1 star Emoji Movie in theaters, few would confess to this openly and admit how much those tiny yellow faces mean to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe understand the sentiment — it’s 2017 and emojis are no longer optional. They’re the visual language of the digital world, employed to express tone, emotion and nuance across both consumer and enterprise products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s easy to add emojis in Figma.

On Windows, open the touch keyboard and click on the smiley face emoji icon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003ePeople building interfaces in Figma need emoji support to get a realistic sense of how their designs will function in the wild. Advertising copy is more relatable with cute smidgens of 😉 or an impish dash of 😜. Texts, tweets and emails would be incomplete without healthy sprinklings of 💃 and 🎉. As Arnold from “Master of None” so eloquently phrased it, “I want kissy or I want red hearts only.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, why did it take us so long to introduce emoji functionality in Figma? When it comes to implementation, these fanciful creatures are tricky buggers, prone to mistranslation across operating systems. The standard emoji sets are owned by the Facebooks, Apples and Googles of the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re curious about the underlying systems that power these ubiquitous pictograms — and how Figma built our emoji system — then this post is for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"the-history-of-the-glyph\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#the-history-of-the-glyph\"\u003eThe history of the glyph\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEmojis are glyphs with pizazz. In 1999 they burst into being after an employee at a Japanese mobile phone operator realized the limitations of text. He created 176 characters to help communicate emotion, and the idea took off. Phone carriers watched jealously as emojis spread and soon began building their own versions to compete.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the years, communication chaos grew as different carriers failed to render other carriers’ emoji sets accurately. In 2009, the Unicode Consortium stepped in to clean up the mess. For the uninitiated, that’s a non-profit coalition of tech companies and other individuals who release an international set of guidelines for representing text. It provides unique code identifiers for every character of every major language, dead or alive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d6a19e023f8c0e34d13a9918d31d6a880cdbf471-800x325.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;h=272\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d6a19e023f8c0e34d13a9918d31d6a880cdbf471-800x325.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d6a19e023f8c0e34d13a9918d31d6a880cdbf471-800x325.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d6a19e023f8c0e34d13a9918d31d6a880cdbf471-800x325.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d6a19e023f8c0e34d13a9918d31d6a880cdbf471-800x325.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 800w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Original Emoji, by Shigetaka Kurita (credit MoMA)\u003cbr/\u003eWhen the Unicode standards committee acknowledged emojis as a pictorial language, they created design guidelines for how to draw them, as well as code that maps to specific emoji.

Allowing browsers to render emojis with their own operating system library just wasn’t an option.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen researching how we could implement emojis, we looked to other companies for inspiration. Slack in particular found a creative workaround for the problem. They decided to make Apple’s emojis their product standard and built a massive PNG file of Apple emojis that Slack hosts itself. The Slack app downloads the PNG file to have on hand. Then, whenever a user calls for an emoji Slack only presents the relevant section of the image. With this method, inserting emoji is very fast. However, this is at the expense of color quality and it’s not possible to render these emoji at larger sizes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46eb444ecdf54dd9333c529eaf18cb37112c26db-800x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46eb444ecdf54dd9333c529eaf18cb37112c26db-800x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46eb444ecdf54dd9333c529eaf18cb37112c26db-800x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46eb444ecdf54dd9333c529eaf18cb37112c26db-800x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46eb444ecdf54dd9333c529eaf18cb37112c26db-800x800.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 800w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eGrainy emojis don’t matter much for Slack’s chat screens (you barely notice it), but we quickly realized that method wouldn’t work for Figma.

We’re introducing a new Image Adjustment feature in Figma that will let you modify the exposure, contrast, saturation, temperature, tint, highlights and shadows of your photos.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are quick fixes that will make tech designers’ lives a lot easier — no more exporting photos to Photoshop or figuring out strange Figma hacks just to darken an image.

We chose the web as our platform for its unrivaled accessibility (sharing a Figma file is as simple as sharing a link!). On the flip side, we have had to work extra hard to make Figma fast and competitive against native applications. For example, \u003ca href=\"https://blog.figma.com/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web-6332ed4f1fcc\"\u003ewe render our canvas entirely with WebGL \u003c/a\u003eand \u003ca href=\"https://blog.figma.com/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x-76f3f2395164\"\u003erecently released a WebAssembly version of our app.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor our desktop app, we doubled down on the web by going with \u003ca href=\"https://electronjs.org/\"\u003eElectron\u003c/a\u003e, a framework to build desktop apps using web technologies. As with our web app, we have worked diligently to make Electron as fast as possible for our needs, tackling smaller bugs and working with Chrome to fix issues that affect Electron.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of our most important contributions to the Electron project is \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-view.md\"\u003eBrowserView\u003c/a\u003e, a new way to embed web apps with fewer bugs and improved performance. It is included in the latest Electron beta release — you can find \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-view.md\"\u003edocumentation here\u003c/a\u003e. It makes the framework faster and more reliable and some companies have already told us they’ll be adopting BrowserView in the future. Heads up that it’s still an experimental API and we’re planning to refine it further.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo explain why BrowserView matters, let’s take a step back to discuss the state of things before now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"embedding-web-apps-with\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#embedding-web-apps-with\"\u003eEmbedding web apps with \u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eEach Electron window usually runs a web app from the local disk. The standard approach to embed remote web apps into an Electron window is to use the \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;webview\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e element. It is conceptually similar to an \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e, except that its contents are rendered in a completely separate process. This has a number of performance, security, and stability benefits compared to the plain old iframe.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany of the most popular Electron applications like Slack and WhatsApp use webviews. For us, webviews seemed to work well at first, but over time we ran into an ever growing list of issues. There were bugs in fundamental features like drag-and-drop and general performance was simply not on par with Chrome. After discussions with other organizations, it became apparent that we were not alone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe situation is especially problematic because we can’t fix these issues in Electron itself. As you may know, Electron uses the Chromium open source project to render web content. The webview is actually implemented in Chromium and also happens to be used by Chrome Apps and Chrome extensions. Unfortunately making large changes to Chromium is out of the question, so we have been waiting for the Chrome team to fix the bugs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe raised the issue with the Electron maintainers and together we decided that the most pragmatic solution was to sidestep webview entirely and build an alternative: BrowserView.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/58d0e142f2a13c622de4ee3b494174ac846951f4-1000x430.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=288\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/58d0e142f2a13c622de4ee3b494174ac846951f4-1000x430.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/58d0e142f2a13c622de4ee3b494174ac846951f4-1000x430.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/58d0e142f2a13c622de4ee3b494174ac846951f4-1000x430.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/58d0e142f2a13c622de4ee3b494174ac846951f4-1000x430.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1000w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo how is the BrowserView different? For one, while webview is part of the DOM hierarchy, BrowserView lives in the operating system window hierarchy. This approach is very similar to how Chrome manages its tabs. Since bugs in Chrome’s tabs are critical and fixed quickly, we eliminated a large class of bugs specific to webview. Web apps running within a BrowserView are also as fast as they are in Chrome.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe trade-off is that positioning and layering BrowserViews is trickier because you can no longer use the normal HTML and CSS positioning and layering primitives like you can with a webview. You have to manually layout BrowserViews and make sure that it is layered properly. For some applications with complex layering and positioning, this may be a deal breaker, but for many applications including Figma, it was a straightforward conversion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4 id=\"\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eElectron has allowed us to quickly build a fully fledged, cross platform desktop app. While neither the web platform nor Electron are perfect, both are evolving rapidly and receptive to contributions. In fact, Electron receives frequent contributions from companies like Slack and Microsoft. At Figma, we remain committed to helping Electron improve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe just released \u003ca href=\"https://releases.figma.com/2017/06/figma-desktop-20.html\"\u003eFigma Desktop 2.0\u003c/a\u003e and shipped BrowserView to our users.

It’s a new binary format for machine code that was specifically designed with browsers in mind. Because apps compiled to WebAssembly can run as fast as native apps, it has the potential to change the way software is written on the web.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany people have started experimenting with toy WebAssembly projects on the side, but it’s hard to tell what the real-world performance gains will be unless you have a large compatible code base for comparison. Because our product is written in C++, which can easily be compiled into WebAssembly, \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/\"\u003eFigma\u003c/a\u003e is a perfect demonstration of this new format’s power. If you haven’t used Figma before, it’s a browser-based interface design tool with a powerful 2D WebGL rendering engine that supports very large documents.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe thought our findings would be useful to the web community as an example of WebAssembly’s impact. Spoiler: it’s much faster.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"overview-of-webassembly\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#overview-of-webassembly\"\u003eOverview of WebAssembly\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWebAssembly allows developers to create desktop-quality experiences on the web without compromising on performance. All major browsers are adding support for it and devoting significant resources to making it as fast as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore WebAssembly, C++ code could be run in the browser by cross-compiling it to a subset of JavaScript known as \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js\"\u003easm.js\u003c/a\u003e. The asm.js subset is basically JavaScript where you can only use numbers (no strings, objects, etc.). This is all you need to run C++ code since everything in C++ is either a number or a pointer to a number, and pointers are also numbers. The C++ address space is just a giant JavaScript array of numbers and pointers are just indices into that array.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWebAssembly is a drop-in replacement for asm.js that is more efficient in every way. But it still maps 1:1 with asm.js so it has the same limitations. Since it can only load and store numbers, it needs to call out to JavaScript code to do anything interesting (create DOM nodes, make network connections, etc.). WebAssembly code is still inside the browser sandbox and can only use the browser APIs that JavaScript has access to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are many benefits to running C++ code using WebAssembly instead of cross-compiling it to JavaScript:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe format is very compact so it takes less time to transfer over the network than the equivalent cross-compiled JavaScript, even when compressed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe format was designed to be as fast as possible for the browser to parse. This isn’t true for JavaScript syntax, which was designed for humans and contains lots of redundancy and extra rules that must be checked before it can be run. WebAssembly parses around \u003ca href=\"https://webassembly.org/docs/rationale/#why-a-binary-encoding\"\u003e20x faster\u003c/a\u003e than asm.js.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eC++ code is heavily optimized by the LLVM toolchain before it’s even encoded in WebAssembly. This means the browser can just translate it directly to native code without doing any optimizations. In contrast, browsers don’t skip optimizations for JavaScript code because it’s usually hand-written and needs many layers of optimizations to be fast.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt’s trivial for browsers to cache the translation of a WebAssembly module to native code. This means the second time you load a page using a WebAssembly module, there’s virtually no load time at all! This isn’t true for asm.js, which is mixed in with regular JavaScript and requires a complex verification pass to validate that it actually follows the asm.js restrictions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWebAssembly has native support for 64-bit integers. JavaScript only has 64-bit floating-point numbers so it \u003ca href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1848700/biggest-integer-that-can-be-stored-in-a-double\"\u003eonly supports 53-bit integers.\u003c/a\u003e 64-bit integers have to be emulated in JavaScript, which can be much slower.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re interested in learning more about WebAssembly, I can recommend both Lin Clark’s \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HktWin_LPf4\"\u003ehigh-level intro presentation\u003c/a\u003e and a \u003ca href=\"https://rsms.me/wasm-intro\"\u003elow-level post\u003c/a\u003e by Rasmus Andersson, a designer and engineer who works at Figma, which describes the WebAssembly format in excellent detail.

This isn’t surprising since one of WebAssembly’s primary goals is to reduce load time.

However, it’s a principled and practical approach to achieving native performance on the web that is well-poised to become core to how the web works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne exciting aspect of WebAssembly is that it has much bigger ambitions than just being a target for C++ code. The design is appropriately general-purpose and it should be easy to add WebAssembly as an alternative output format for any compiler that targets native code. An official LLVM backend is in development that, when finished, will make it easy for any language using the LLVM toolchain to emit WebAssembly code directly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWebAssembly also \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1079\"\u003ehas plans\u003c/a\u003e to expose bindings to the JavaScript garbage collector at some point. That will make it much easier to cross-compile garbage-collected languages (Java, C#, etc.) to WebAssembly. You can read more about upcoming WebAssembly features \u003ca href=\"https://www.chromestatus.com/features#webassembly\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother compelling aspect of WebAssembly is that it’s an integrated part of the web platform. It’s natural and expected to create web apps that use both JavaScript and WebAssembly modules. For example, if you want universal JPEG 2000 support, you no longer have to wait for it to be supported in all browsers. Just cross-compile a decoder to WebAssembly and call it from JavaScript! It should be just as fast as if it were part of the browser itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis could potentially improve iteration time of the web platform. Browsers can focus on exposing low-level hardware primitives (WebGL, Bluetooth, USB, etc.) and leave the development of higher-level libraries to the community, which can evolve at a faster pace.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though WebAssembly isn’t quite ready yet, Figma is still investing in it because we believe that it’s an important part of the future of the web.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLike working on state-of-the-art web apps? \u003ca href=\"https://www.figma.com/careers/\"\u003eCome work at Figma!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

There are a lot of reasons no one successfully built a product like this before now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn our early days, many labeled Figma a toy instead of a real tool.

Instead, its super power is that it gives teams a single source of truth.

Major corporations like \u003ca href=\"https://qz.com/755741/ibm-is-becoming-the-worlds-largest-design-company/\"\u003eIBM\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://gigaom.com/2014/04/27/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-how-ge-is-using-design-to-change-how-people-use-its-machines/\"\u003eGE\u003c/a\u003e are going on designer hiring sprees and companies like Facebook are trying to to hire one designer for every four or five engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDespite this insatiable demand, the technology designers need to do their jobs hasn’t kept up. Designers need tools that make collaboration easier, and we’re using that as our north star as we plan the future of Figma.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn that note, I’m excited to announce two new major hires: Eric Wittman, formerly of Atlassian, has joined as our first COO, and Kris Rasmussen, coming from Asana, will be our new Vice President of Engineering. Eric and Kris are seasoned pros at growing collaboration companies, and they’ll help us make the most of the opportunity in front of us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"eric-wittman\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#eric-wittman\"\u003eEric Wittman\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo give you a little background on the fresh faces, Eric’s an industry veteran who previously ran the Developer Tools business at Atlassian, including Bitbucket. At Figma, in addition to scaling processes like recruiting and finance, he’ll be focusing on GTM and revenue. While Eric has only been at Figma for a few months now, he already helped us launch our pricing model and nail down company strategy + values.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m not surprised Eric’s such an effective strategist — when we first met, his unconventional back story showed he would be. In his early years, he started in customer support at Macromedia, but through determination and ingenuity ultimately rose through the ranks to become the lead product manager on Flash. He picked up startup experience as the CEO of music player Songbird, and learned the ins and outs of SaaS and bottoms-up business models as GM of Developer Tools at Atlassian.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor an operations pro he’s deeply passionate about product — in fact, I initially passed over him in our first interview because he spent so much time talking about our application that I thought he was solely a product guy.

Even though he was only here two days a week he quickly became an informal leader on the team in a powerful, unassuming way. He was always the person saying what needed to be said or helping move the ball forward when disagreements arose.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we dug into Kris’ background, we learned Kris was not only an incredible engineer, but also an accomplished leader. He ran engineering at Asana in its early days, which gave him experience both guiding a team and building infrastructure for collaborative tools. Before Asana, he helped scale engineering at Aptana, a company which makes developer tools for web applications. Lastly, on his own personal projects, he worked on some super interesting applications of 3D graphics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKris will help us continue to build a world class technical team at Figma, and oversee many of our engineering projects. I couldn’t be more thrilled to have him on board.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"we-re-hiring\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#we-re-hiring\"\u003eWe’re hiring!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’re only just getting started at Figma; there are many exciting opportunities and challenges ahead of us.

I got the most expensive version of it, it’s all stained and the pages are yellow, it’s got the stamps from my favorite designer’s personal library. I love it.

It combines a few standard techniques to control the rate at which people issue requests to your server, and it’s relatively accurate, simple, and space-efficient. If you’re a company building web applications at consumer scale, our rate limiter can prevent users from harming your website’s availability with a spate of requests. It also happens to be great at stopping spam attacks, as we discovered.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor those unfamiliar, a rate limiter caps how many requests a sender — this could be a user or an IP address — can issue in a specific window of time (e.g. 25 requests per minute). In Figma’s case, it also needed to:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003estore data externally so that the multiple machines running our web application could share it\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003enot appreciably slow down web requests\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eefficiently eject outdated data\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eaccurately limit excessive use of our web application\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003euse as little memory as possible\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first three requirements were easy to meet. At Figma, we use two external data stores — Redis and PostgreSQL — and Redis was the better location to save tracking data. Redis is an in-memory data store that offers extremely quick reads and writes relative to PostgreSQL, an on-disk relational database. Even better, it’s simple to specify when Redis should delete expired data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinding a way to satisfy the last two requirements — accurately controlling web traffic and minimizing memory usage — was more of a challenge.

This wasn’t ideal for Figma. A single rate limit of 500 requests per day per user on a website with 10,000 active users per day could hypothetically mean storing 5,000,000 values in Redis. If each stored timestamp value in Redis were even a 4-byte integer, this would take ~20 MB (4 bytes per timestamp * 10,000 users * 500 requests/user = 20,000,000 bytes).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"sliding-window-counters\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#sliding-window-counters\"\u003eSliding window counters\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eUltimately, the last two rate limiter approaches — fixed window counters and sliding window log — inspired the algorithm that stopped the spammers. We count requests from each sender using multiple fixed time windows 1/60th the size of our rate limit’s time window.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, if we have an hourly rate limit, we increment counters specific to the current Unix minute timestamp and calculate the sum of all counters in the past hour when we receive a new request. To reduce our memory footprint, we store our counters in a Redis hash — they offer \u003ca href=\"https://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization\"\u003eextremely efficient storage when they have fewer than 100 keys.\u003c/a\u003e When each request increments a counter in the hash, it also sets the hash to expire an hour later.

If we have a rate limit of 500 requests per day per user on a website with 10,000 active users, we would at most need to store ~600,000 values in Redis. That comes out to a memory footprint of ~2.4 MB (4 bytes per counter * 60 counters * 10,000 users = 2,400,000 bytes).

In practice, however, a large enforcement time window — e.g. one hour — slightly reduced the precision of the rate limiter. This is best illustrated through an example: For an hourly rate limit, when the rate limiter checks usage at 11:00:35, it ignores the requests that occurred between 10:00:00 and 10:00:59.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cbecdc7bac660047990a9b2b97db361d4c296d99-658x420.png?rect=0,0,657,420\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=428\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cbecdc7bac660047990a9b2b97db361d4c296d99-658x420.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cbecdc7bac660047990a9b2b97db361d4c296d99-658x420.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cbecdc7bac660047990a9b2b97db361d4c296d99-658x420.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 657w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eIf we count requests in 60 fixed minute windows and check the number of requests when we’re within a fixed minute window, we may undercount the total number of requests in the last hour.

In our situation, however, we preferred for our rate limiter to sometimes be a tad harsher instead of slightly lenient, so I calculated the sum of all counters in the last hour and one minute whenever the current timestamp wasn’t divisible by 60. Variable restrictiveness could even be useful in discouraging programmatic scripting against the site.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, we had to reflect on how to respond to users who exceeded the rate limit. Traditionally, web applications respond to requests from users who surpass the rate limit with a HTTP response code of 429. Our rate limiter initially did so as well. But in the case of Figma’s spam attack, our attackers saw the response code change from 200 to 429 and simply created new accounts to circumvent the rate limiting on their blocked accounts.

Celebrating the fundamentals of design\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery design begins with same basic elements — points, lines, and shapes. Similarly, even the most complex designs can be reduced to these indispensable pieces. It’s our belief that a great design is one where these pieces are used efficiently together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor instance, early on when designing Figma we often talked about what tools you need to create modern design for screens. We realized that the tool set does not have to be large if the tools are carefully selected and work together well. With a small set of functions (like the vector-network tool or a frame), designers can create a lot of different things to form complex means of expression.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe same is true for communications design. You can create much of our designed world by using a small set of elemental shapes to build things of great complexity. Although the use of primary shapes and colors was famously promoted at the \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus\"\u003eBauhaus school\u003c/a\u003e as fundamental to design, these forms have been part of the language of design for hundreds of years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFigma exists to empower and enable designers and their teams to create their best work.

As software plays an ever increasing role in our lives, the digital world continues to fragment into myriad screen sizes, internet connection speeds, monitors and operating systems. As a result, it makes sense to create components for design that can work together, like a recipe or blueprint, rather than one-off solutions. Here at Figma, we often talk of designing systems, not artifacts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn example of this is designing with vectors rather then pixels. If you can create a design that is made up of a ruleset, it can adapt to any environment. If you design with a fixed set of pixels, they’re bound to break down in the wrong context.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Figma we’ve \u003ca href=\"https://blog.figma.com/team-libraries-in-figma-409fa5e20f7\"\u003eintroduced features\u003c/a\u003e to empower designers building these systems, and we wanted our icon to also suggest this style of work.

It’s a question that feels like it’s been around since neanderthal designers were sketching buffaloes on cave walls. But a decade ago, the dilemma wasn’t the “weird rite of passage people have to go through on Twitter” that it is today, says Alex Cornell, the designer in charge of Facebook Live. As a young designer, Cornell decided to learn film and photography instead, an expertise that paid off years later when Facebook recruited him to help launch their Live feature.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe talked to Cornell about why he decided to forego the heavily trodden code path and forge his own route.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo Alex, I hear you’re not a designer slash coder. Why?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I was making that decision in 2007, that wasn’t a question floating around Twitter, it was just a decision you had to make. Do I want to learn to code or play the piano? Nothing more complicated than that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhere I was, at a startup with a bunch of engineers, it seemed like a waste. We had four guys who knew deeply how to code — went to school for it, came out of Google — and then me who’s a beginning designer. We’re a team of people, it would be beneficial to learn something no one else knows how to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what else would be helpful? For me it became filmmaking in general — After Effects, Premiere, the technical part of filmmaking. After Effects was probably the most helpful since there weren’t prototyping tools back then, I would use it to animate faces the way I thought we should show them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBasically, that’s an easy way of saying coding sounded boring and making motion graphics didn’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you ever regret that choice?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTen years later you always wonder ‘What would it have been like if I started taking Japanese lessons ten years ago?’ which is another thing I think about. I do regret not learning to code sometimes, but it doesn’t take too long to retrace the logical path I described and the same conclusion comes to me. Especially now, I work at Facebook and knowing how to code is not necessary but what I have learned over the years is very helpful — how to talk to engineers and help them understand how to translate design into their language.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen young designers ask you whether they should learn to code what do you say?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf they don’t know then the answer is probably no.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt always strikes me as a funny thing — if somebody asked me, “Should I learn to edit film?” I’d be like, “Well I don’t know — do you like film?” The next five questions would make the answer super obvious and I hope most people would be able to think of it on their own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese days as the tools are getting blurred, where the boundary is between coding and design — the guy who works next to me works in Framer, I work in Origami and I’m building logic trees — the boundary is pretty blurry these days so it’s less of a binary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat speaks to why this question keeps coming up. If there was a right answer to it and people understood ‘Yes designers should code’ there’d be no need for the question. But for everyone there’s a different right answer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf they choose to focus on something else besides coding, what do you recommend?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe two that come to mind for me are writing and…I don’t know the right word for it, but communication or presentation. It’s one thing to do a great design and code it or do an awesome animation, but there’s a low chance of it going anywhere if you don’t get people excited about it.

In the last two years alone big companies acquired more than 35 design agencies. Facebook, Google and Amazon have hired 65 percent more designers in the past year. Why’s the demand happening now? “Because technology is so commoditized, anyone can make an app,” Maeda told us. “Now that you can do that, how does it make someone feel, how relevant is it to someone’s life?

Each client instantaneously applies its edits locally and then sends them off to the server, which then sends the edits to other connected clients. This means edits may be applied in a different order on each client. When designing the algorithm, we have to make sure the document ends up looking identical regardless of the order in which edits are applied.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"operational-transformation\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#operational-transformation\"\u003eOperational Transformation\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe initially considered using a technique called Operational Transformation to solve this. It’s an old algorithm that was originally developed for text and was popularized by early collaborative text editors such as Google Wave. While we didn’t end up using OT, it’s perhaps the most common approach to this type of problem and it’s useful to contrast OT with our approach.

The number of reordering operations is bounded by user activity in practice, and normal usage patterns never generate prohibitively-large index lengths.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second drawback (interleaving) would be a concern for a text editor but isn’t really a concern for us given the nature of design documents.

And if interleaving looks weird, users can just manually fix the ordering afterwards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe third drawback (averaging identical indices) has a simple workaround that avoids this problem entirely. This case arises when two clients try to simultaneously insert a new object between the same two objects. The server can avoid ever having two objects with an identical position by just generating and assigning a unique position to the second insert operation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe’ve been using fractional indexing for multiplayer editing in Figma from the beginning and it’s worked out really well for us.

Physical paper doesn’t have interactivity, so while you could draw pictures of applications with these tools, they’d never really understand how the app would actually behave in different contexts. Communicating realistic application behavior in a static artboard or using constraints that don’t actually exist in a platform’s API just isn’t good enough.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo make matters worse, your source of truth is a moving target. When building out a design system, you might start with a master file with some nice documentation and a well-defined system of symbols. That’s a great start, but as soon as you copy symbols from one file to another, they’re out-of-sync and can only be updated manually. Now you have to dig through all your design documents, replace symbols and update their overrides one symbol at a time any time you make a minor change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs designers, our tools just don’t support the synchronized and compounding component structures needed to create lasting design systems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2555eedf35ceae8d5b6cf8f77e261fb370766b81-800x281.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=235\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2555eedf35ceae8d5b6cf8f77e261fb370766b81-800x281.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2555eedf35ceae8d5b6cf8f77e261fb370766b81-800x281.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2555eedf35ceae8d5b6cf8f77e261fb370766b81-800x281.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2555eedf35ceae8d5b6cf8f77e261fb370766b81-800x281.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 800w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eBrad Frost’s Atomic Design\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eNone of this is new.

They let you create effective, scalable design systems by reusing shared, synchronized components across files and team members. This feature makes it easier and more efficient to build layouts with rules and structure, enabling faster design processes for a wide variety of devices and platforms. Because it’s always online, there’s effectively zero sync time across your files.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eTeam Libraries in Figma\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"our-approach\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#our-approach\"\u003eOur Approach\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust as systemic design has moved from being a “nice-to-have” to becoming a requirement in product design, the composition of applications from discrete, clearly-defined parts has become more popular in engineering, via frameworks like React.

Only people with Edit permissions to the source file can modify your source components, but anyone with View access can use the published components from that file. So, now your Production Designers are the only ones who can edit the file with the final icon assets and your Brand Designers are the only group who can control your color documentation. Everyone else can use their work, but they can’t set the rules.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"insert\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#insert\"\u003eInsert\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve added your components to your team’s library, they’re available to anyone who has permission to view the source file.

Simply make the changes inside the existing component and publish it again. You’ll get a confirmation step, just like when you added them to the team library in the first place and you’ll see a nice visual diff of what changed from the last version.

This is what makes vector networks not just a graph, but a \u003cem\u003emultigraph\u003c/em\u003e. If we try to sort by the angle to the non-deleted endpoint vertex, then we’d get the same key for the top two curved edges.

So for each cubic bezier curve (P0, P1, P2, P3) attached to the deleted vertex P0, we use the angle of the curve as it leaves P0 (usually the angle from P0 to P1), not the angle from P0 to P3 like we did in the previous section.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"region-healing\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#region-healing\"\u003eRegion Healing\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe last piece of this puzzle has to do with regions.

Our web app has several sources of non-determinism including asynchronous timers and network events, so this wasn’t too surprising.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next step was to check the generated files themselves. At the time, our file format was a zip file that wrapped a document encoded using Google’s \u003ca href=\"https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/\"\u003eFlatBuffers\u003c/a\u003e library. FlatBuffers is a schema-driven file format with zero-parsing overhead, meaning you can load the raw buffer and traverse the encoded object graph without having to run the parser over the entire file first. The bytes of the generated file looked reasonable but some of the offsets to data later on in the file were suspiciously zeroed out. Data being written out of place is usually a symptom of a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety\"\u003ememory safety violation\u003c/a\u003e, which is when a C++ program reads or writes memory that it shouldn’t (use before initialization, use after free, out of bounds access, etc.).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI have a love-hate relationship with C++, the language that Figma’s editor is written in.

Despite its benefits however, C++ is a perfect storm of poor language design decisions, an error-prone standard library API, and legacy from C which together make it impossible to completely avoid accidentally introducing memory safety violations in large projects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?rect=1,0,1397,342\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=164\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eAn example real-world memory safety violation in Chrome (“OnClose” likely removes the stream, which invalidates “it”)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe C++ language doesn’t have any safeguards against these errors whatsoever, so the C++ community has instead provided tools that attempt to detect these problems.

You can even create a reduced test case by randomly dropping events as long as they don’t cause the bug to disappear.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdding a system like this onto an existing app is a big project because real user sessions have all sorts of events.

We initially focused on making sure the product worked well for individual users before we tackled teams of people working together. Our first saving model involved downloading the document, editing it locally in the browser, and uploading the whole document again periodically as you edit. It was a practical first approach; easy to build, easy to understand, and easy to iterate on top of in order to quickly get people using Figma for real work. Editing locally is also similar to how many designers collaborate over syncing services such as Dropbox today so we figured it would also feel familiar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, as time went on and we started adding more team features, it was clear that something was wrong. Every single save was recorded in the version history so data was never lost, but people would sometimes save over each other without realizing it. Other times people would share a link to their document with a collaborator but they would see the old version because we hadn’t finished saving yet. It turns out “easy to understand” wasn’t true after all. Our simple approach to saving was fundamentally incompatible with a collaborative environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though we knew the optimal solution to these problems was simultaneous editing, we were still hesitant. Building multiplayer would be a huge technological investment, require a lot of time and resources, and involve changing the core fundamentals of the editor itself. We explored cheaper alternatives including a “baton-passing” mode where there was only one active editor at a time, but nothing else had the simplicity and elegance we were going for. Today our year-long investment in multiplayer has finally paid off. Collaboration in Figma now feels right!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eMultiplayer in action\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"and-then-things-got-a-little-complicated\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#and-then-things-got-a-little-complicated\"\u003eAnd then things got a little complicated\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe idea behind our multiplayer engine is simple in theory. Changes from each user are sent up to the server and broadcast to other users in real-time. Two simultaneous changes are independent unless they affect the same property on the same object, in which case we pick the latest change. Theory never holds up in practice though, and sure enough we ran into lots of unexpected technical problems along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUndo history has a natural definition for single-player mode, but undo in a multiplayer environment is inherently confusing. If other people have edited the same objects that you edited and then undo, what should happen? Should your earlier edits be applied over their later edits? What about redo? We had a lot of trouble until we settled on a principle to help guide us: if you undo a lot, copy something, and redo back to the present (a common operation), the document should not change. This may seem obvious but the single-player implementation of redo means “put back what I did” which may end up overwriting what other people did next if you’re not careful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were also quite a few technical challenges with the conflict resolution algorithm. Sometimes different properties on the same object had to be changed together, which meant a change to any one of those properties would have to be carefully merged with a change to any of the other ones. Other times a seemingly simple action on one object actually affected certain other objects too so users editing two seemingly unrelated objects would cause unintentional conflicts. This required changing some of how our layout features work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt probably goes without saying but performance was a big challenge too. A professional-quality multiplayer implementation involved a lot of measurement and tuning, including overhauling our file format because the old format wasn’t efficient enough for small message sizes. There are also many more upcoming multiplayer challenges around new features in the pipeline. But it’s worth it. Software is becoming more connected and collaborative, and design software should be no exception.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"and-now-it-just-feels-right\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#and-now-it-just-feels-right\"\u003e…and now it just feels right\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMultiplayer editing feels like a natural extension of single-player editing. Introducing multiplayer actually reduced the overall complexity of Figma’s UX because it removed all of the awkward workflows that people had been using to work around the lack of multiplayer. The result is a few simple features that combine in powerful ways to provide a great collaborative editing experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first thing you’ll notice when you edit something alongside someone else is their mouse cursor. We show the cursor and selection of all active participants because it provides important context. Who else is here? Where are they working? Cursors can come in handy for other things too, such as waving your cursor around to get someone’s attention or placing your cursor by an object to point at it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eTwo users editing simultaneously\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery user in the document gets an avatar in the top right corner. In addition to showing who’s present, avatars are also useful for presentations. Clicking on someone’s avatar means they are presenting to you. We initially tried making presentation mode mandatory by enforcing that there was one presenter per document and that all viewers had to follow along with the presentation, but that felt wrong. This way presentations are opt-in so you can temporarily disable it, go look at something else, and then return to the presentation without interrupting anyone else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003ePresentation mode in action\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eMultiplayer editing isn’t just for collaboration between different people. It’s also for collaboration with yourself! Once we had multiplayer working it was trivial to use it for live broadcasting your edits to all of your mobile devices as you work.

You have total control over when and how you use multiplayer. Newly-created personal files start off in a space that’s only accessible to you. From the “Share” button you can grant viewer and editor permissions when you’re ready to share it. Figma supports setting these permissions both on an individual file and an entire project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=287\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"try-it\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#try-it\"\u003eTry it!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuilding our multiplayer editing engine and making it a core part of Figma was an immense technical challenge, but we made the investment because we firmly believe that this is the future of design tools.

After releasing Figma in beta last December, our top request has been adding support for various prototyping tools. Of these tools, we hear the most demand for Framer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"why-prototyping\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#why-prototyping\"\u003eWhy prototyping?\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith the proliferation of mobile, designing static mockups on a 27” Thunderbolt display doesn’t cut it anymore. For designers to create the best possible experience, they need the ability to do three things:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDesign specifically for the context in which work will be viewed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCommunicate the end user’s experience by showing how a screen changes based on input.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAdd transitions and moments of joy to their design through motion graphics.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are pain points I’ve experienced myself. Before Evan and I started Figma, I worked on the design team at Flipboard. When I was there in 2012 meeting the needs outlined above was a huge burden; we would either use video editing products like After Effects or build out a full prototype in HTML / JS / CSS, save to a remote server via FTP then load the prototype on a mobile phone over 3G. This workflow was cumbersome and inefficient, less about creative intent and more about working around various browser consistency issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSince then designers have demanded a better workflow. In response, an entirely new market of prototyping tools has emerged. It seems like a new prototyping tool launches every week. However, Figma users consistently and constantly request integration with one specifically: Framer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe integration that launches today simplifies workflows by allowing users to import Figma assets while working in Framer with one click rather than having to export layer-by-layer and then upload to Framer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere’s what is looks like:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"working-with-framer\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#working-with-framer\"\u003eWorking with Framer\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen exploring a Framer integration, we talked with a few of our users about why they wanted this functionality. Circle designer Jonathan Simcoe explained it best:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Since Framer is based in code I have found it to be the most expressive way to prototype. It is entirely open-ended. Framer especially excels at complex, single-page interactions. Figma has been instrumental for our team in designing and iterating on UI quickly. Framer is the best way to prototype. An integration allows us to get our UI ideas into code quickly, test them, and ship faster and better.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe think it is awesome how Framer is making code-based prototyping accessible to an entire generation of designers.

I remember being very surprised when I first encountered modern vector editing tools. Many of the interactions felt broken. Why couldn’t you just manipulate things directly? Why did connecting and disconnecting stuff only sometimes work? Is this the best we can do?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe pen tool as we know it today was originally introduced in 1987 and has remained largely unchanged since then. We decided to try something new when we set out to build the vector editing toolset for Figma. Instead of using paths like other tools, Figma is built on something we’re calling vector networks which are backwards-compatible with paths but which offer much more flexibility and control:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"a-vector-network-in-action\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#a-vector-network-in-action\"\u003eA vector network in action\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter our first implementation of vector networks, we did a series of user studies to refine the concept. We were surprised to discover that many people didn’t even notice a difference between vector networks and paths. The tool just worked how people expected it to work. They did notice the difference when they went back and tried to use other tools, however. That was especially painful to watch and confirmed to us we had found something special.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"strokes\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#strokes\"\u003eStrokes\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo understand vector networks, it’s useful to first understand paths. A path is a chain of lines and curves from one endpoint to the other. You can think of a path as a sequence of instructions that a device like a pen plotter might follow. Put the pen down, drag it around, and lift it up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?rect=1,0,1439,1080\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=503\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThink of a pen plotter when thinking of paths (Photograph by Tomasz Sienicki)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eA vector network improves on the path model by allowing lines and curves between any two points instead of requiring that they all join up to form a single chain. This helps provide the best of both worlds; it combines the ease with which points can be connected on paper and the ease with which geometry can be manipulated once it’s drawn. Splitting and recombining geometry is much more natural with vector networks. Delete anything, anywhere. Connect anything to anything else. Stroke cap and join styles just work naturally in vector networks, even for points with three or more lines coming off of them. This isn’t the case for paths because it’s impossible to use paths to represent attaching three lines together at a single point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eVector networks support standard stroke cap and join styles\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"bending\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#bending\"\u003eBending\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother way we wanted to improve over existing vector editing tools was to add support for direct manipulation. Vector graphics today are based on cubic bezier splines, which are curves with two extra points called control handles that are positioned away from the curve itself and that control how much it bends, sort of like how a magnet might bend a wire towards it. Changing the shape of a curve involves dragging a control handle off in space instead of dragging the curve directly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe initially experimented with some powerful curve types that can provide greater control and shaping power, but in the end it made the most sense to remain backwards-compatible with existing vector data. That’s why both paths and vector networks use the same type of curves. In addition to dragging the control handles, Figma’s bend tool (the command key on OS X) lets you drag the curve around directly. The editor will automatically figure out where to place the control handles for you:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe bend tool drags curves around\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"fills\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fills\"\u003eFills\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other job of the vector engine is filling the area between curves with color. All current vector engines use a confusing concept called the winding number to fill the area between curves. It uses the number of times the path winds around a given location to decide whether that location is inside or outside the shape. The number depends on the direction in which you originally drew the curves (clockwise or counter-clockwise), which is especially counter-intuitive because no vector editor actually shows you the direction your curve is going in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670\u0026amp;h=373\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe non-zero winding rule means fill depends on curve orientation\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of using this confusing concept, fills in Figma start off by automatically filling all enclosed space:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eEnclosed space is filled automatically\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you later want to add holes, just punch the holes out directly without needing to worry about curve orientation:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe paint bucket tool can toggle the fill for any enclosed region\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eGetting fills to work well was the hardest part.

The design and execution need to be as close to perfect as possible. The digital world is different (duh, Pease) — you have daily opportunities to make improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurniture gives function to what is otherwise empty space. The primary purpose is to support the act of living, whatever that means for each user. Furniture itself is not the focus; the life you create around it is what matters.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe challenge of Figma is to design a product whose ultimate value is how well other people are able to design their own products. This means that Figma should fade away, and enable users to focus solely on their ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are a few ways furniture design principles have influenced the way I’ve gone about designing Figma over the past two years:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt is possible to do a lot with a very basic toolset. A hammer can be used to build a small cabinet or an entire house. With Figma, we’ve tried to whittle down our primary drawing tools to the most foundational yet versatile set, tools that are well-equipped for tasks both simple and complex.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur pen tool, for example, has been rethought to feel and function more similarly to a physical pen. Vector objects in Figma are drawn as networks of points, rather than traditional paths, meaning you can connect any point to any other point. This change allows for a more flexible and natural drawing process, shifting the focus from procedure to production.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Figma editor should feel like a tightly knolled workbench. The basic tools you need to get started are simple and well organized.

Keyboard shortcuts are a familiar opportunity to give users this physical control and increase efficiency. The product detail I’m most proud of is a key command that addresses an annoyance in selecting nested items on screen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA common desire is to select the content of an element without selecting the element itself, like selecting the buttons within a toolbar without selecting the toolbar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you command+drag, Figma uses a heuristic to figure out which items are the container and which are contained, and it will select only the contained items. This allows you to box select all the icons in the toolbar without selecting the toolbar background itself. I have found this command to be incredibly useful and a significant time saver as it lets me work with the elements in the scene without having to think about layer hierarchy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"color\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#color\"\u003eColor\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe principle that furniture should facilitate living was informative to the original visual design of Figma. Just as furniture should fade away when in use, it was our intention early on to create a system to ensure that the visual style of our product wouldn’t distract users from the aesthetics of their own designs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA previous version of Figma embraced an “unskinned” visual style, relying almost entirely on a monochromatic palette.

It wasn’t that the UI had to totally “disappear,” but instead should go unnoticed. To do this, our current visual style uses color as an additional layer of semantics. For instance, green is used for actions and blue for selection. These groupings across the layout of the tool help inform users at a glance, shifting cognition from how to what they’re drawing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"design-across-disciplines\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#design-across-disciplines\"\u003eDesign Across Disciplines\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo create innovative solutions for design tools, we must continually challenge our collective frame of reference. In his post Grid Systems for Screen Design, my teammate Johan Prag pointed out that “some of the most interesting solutions may come from looking to the past.” I agree and move to cast this net even wider. The best principles of design transcend disciplines.

Their work came to be known as grid design and a handful of pioneers like Joseph Müller-Brockmann and Karl Gerstner produced work that was as beautiful as it was rational.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday their ideas are still foundational. Grids are the invisible scaffolding that give a design coherence. Their work took for granted a few things, though: a fixed page size with precise control over type-size, line-height and margins. Because of this, it can often feel incompatible within our current age of designing for a fluidity of device sizes and screen densities. We at Figma believe this is less a problem of philosophical incompatibility, and more an issue of contemporary digital designers lacking the proper tools. We think grids are as foundational for our flexible canvases as they are for a fixed page.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we started designing for screens, much traditional knowledge was thrown out due to the technical limitations of the new medium. Nowadays, we have better support for typography and better control over layouts, but the tools we are using have not yet adapted to designing for screens. Even for web design where browser sizes are fluid, designers are still working with tools created for fixed layouts. A designer or an engineer then has to figure out how to translate a design based on the conventions of the past into the present reality of knowing very little about how the design will be displayed. Making sure that the design translates would either involve a lot of repetitive copy/pasting between artboards of different sizes or some sophisticated guesswork.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the first iPad was introduced, many designers welcomed the return of the page and of edges — comforting boundaries that help anchor a design. With new devices introduced every year, it is now obvious that the ‘page’ in digital design can take any size and shape. Less obvious is how a tool can allow you to design in a way that is flexible yet also allows for a fine degree of control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"building-blocks\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#building-blocks\"\u003eBuilding blocks\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen I started working at Figma, I thought this was a challenge our team could tackle. Our approach is to create a set of tools built for flexible screen sizes that allow you to create very powerful layout systems when properly combined. The toolset consists of a) constraints b) layout grids and c) the ability to nest a frame inside of another frame. (We call them frames, other people call them artboards.) You can get started using just one of these tools, but the real power comes from combining them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?rect=0,0,1440,404\u0026amp;w=670\u0026amp;h=188\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\" srcset=\"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?w=670\u0026amp;q=75\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;dpr=2 1340w\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eConstraints, grids \u0026amp; frames in Figma\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"constraints\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#constraints\"\u003eConstraints\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe started with constraints.

This is where grids come in. In Figma, grids are the device that allows granular control over how constraints work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTake a look at this design. We use a grid system to keep everything in balance, but how would you want the design to change as the screen resizes? What if you want X to grow with the change in screen dimensions? Our solution has been to allow grids to stretch, and our constraint system knows how to work hand-in-hand with the grid. If you stretch a box over two grid columns, the box will grow and shrink to align itself to the grid as the screen size changes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeyond the obvious use of a column grid to dictate the flow of text on a web-page, column grids are useful for helping align all kinds of elements. For example, consider a row of icons in a toolbar with each icon aligned to a column of the grid. At that point, the grid and constraints alone do not allow the icons to respond to the grid whilst also allowing for a different layout of the main content. However, it does when you nest one frame inside of another.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eA design based on a 2-column grid with 4 vertical modules\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"frames-within-frames\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#frames-within-frames\"\u003eFrames within frames\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNesting frames is the last piece of the puzzle that gives you full control over the alignment of your design as a whole. This ability is also one of the reasons why we chose not to call them artboards, frames go beyond artboards in the functionality they offer. Using multiple frames for the same design also allows you to set up different layout grids for different parts of your design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re familiar with HTML, you might notice this structure is similar to how you would translate a design into code.

When we set out to build Figma we knew it would be a challenge. To really succeed it would have to provide a high-fidelity editing experience that professionals would accept and would have to work consistently everywhere.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003ePulling this off was really hard; we’ve basically ended up building a browser inside a browser.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reason this is hard is because the web wasn’t designed as a general-purpose computing platform. It started off as a technology primarily for documents and had a whole bunch of stuff for application development bolted on top. That stuff usually took the form of specific APIs for one-off cases instead of providing general primitives that can be used to implement all sorts of things. Some examples:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCSS has lots of \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-rend-props\"\u003efancy text layout algorithms\u003c/a\u003e but no way to customize the algorithms or to read back the result of what the browser did so the text layout algorithm can be used as part of another algorithm.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll browsers provide a \u003ca href=\"https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/gpu-accelerated-compositing-in-chrome\"\u003ehigh-performance\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj680148%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\"\u003eGPU compositor\u003c/a\u003e but the web doesn’t have any way of hooking into the rendering algorithm and changing how compositing works to add things like performance optimizations or custom blend modes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBrowsers embed \u003ca href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=573948\"\u003ehighly-optimized\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=48789\"\u003eimage\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2013/09/12/using-hardware-to-decode-and-load-jpg-images-up-to-45-faster-in-internet-explorer-11.aspx\"\u003edecoders\u003c/a\u003e that decode images asynchronously off the UI thread using the latest hardware features, but there’s no API for passing parameters to the decoders to do things like \u003ca href=\"https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2014Apr/0064.html\"\u003ehandle EXIF orientation\u003c/a\u003e or avoid \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=425935#c8\"\u003ebaking in the display color space\u003c/a\u003e when using drawImage and getImageData.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis lack of general primitives on the web is \u003ca href=\"https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/\"\u003estarting to change\u003c/a\u003e and now there are technologies like WebGL and asm.js that let developers cut past the browser and talk directly to the hardware. It’s this advancement that’s finally made high-performance web-based graphics applications practical. Developers no longer need to wait for the exact features they need to be added to the web, they can build those features themselves!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"emscripten\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#emscripten\"\u003eEmscripten\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur editor is written in C++ and cross-compiled to JavaScript using the \u003ca href=\"https://emscripten.org/\"\u003eemscripten\u003c/a\u003e cross-compiler.

This has the following benefits:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe fully control memory layout and can use compact 32-bit floats or even bytes when appropriate instead of JavaScript’s 64-bit doubles. This is very important for apps like ours that use large amounts of data.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe generated code is completely in control of allocation, which makes it much easier to hit 60fps by avoiding GC pauses. All C++ objects are just reserved ranges in a pre-allocated typed array so the JavaScript GC is never involved.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe generated code is pre-optimized using LLVM’s advanced optimizer. This combined with C++ template specialization generates very efficient code that is able to come within a factor of \u003ca href=\"https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/asm-js-performance-improvements-in-the-latest-version-of-firefox-make-games-fly/\"\u003e2x native performance or better\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAll asm.js code is guaranteed to be free of deoptimization points so JITs can do ahead-of-time compilation and provide predictable performance. Regular JavaScript code relies on JIT heuristics instead and performance can sometimes vary wildly between subsequent runs of the same code.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat’s not to say emscripten is perfect. As with any new technology, there were bumps along the road. One big issue for us was that certain browser configurations couldn’t allocate large ranges of continuous address space for the huge typed array that contains the entire emscripten memory space. The worst case was \u003ca href=\"https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=394591\"\u003e32-bit Chrome on Windows\u003c/a\u003e which sometimes couldn’t even allocate a 256mb typed array because \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization\"\u003eASLR\u003c/a\u003e was fragmenting the address space. This has since been fixed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA trick that also helps is to use handles to out-of-heap data for large resources such as image and geometry buffers. We have an internal API called IndirectBuffer (which we are open sourcing \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/evanw/indirectbuffer\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e) that references an external typed array and makes it available to C++. Moving large allocations out of the main heap reduces memory fragmentation issues for long-running sessions, allows us to use more of the limited address space in 32-bit browsers, and allows us to break past the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/f01d2bb66fcde2c3519c4f0c61f790387fd5faee/Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/ArrayBuffer.h#L255\"\u003e31-bit typed array size limitation\u003c/a\u003e in 64-bit browsers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCurrent asm.js support is already quite good but there’s more exciting changes coming up. \u003ca href=\"https://www.2ality.com/2015/06/web-assembly.html\"\u003eWebAssembly\u003c/a\u003e is an effort to implement a binary format for asm.js code to drastically reduce parse time that all major browser vendors are on board with.

Browsers have amazing graphics implementations and we initially attempted to use them instead of building a new rendering engine. Without a low-level API to access the browser’s render tree, the available options are either HTML, SVG, or 2D canvas. None of these options were satisfactory for many reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHTML and SVG contain a lot of baggage and are often much slower than the 2D canvas API due to DOM access. These are usually optimized for scrolling, not zooming, and geometry is often re-tessellated after every scale change.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere is no guarantee about GPU acceleration and many things are still rendered on the CPU, which can be quite slow in certain cases.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSupport for masking, blurring, and blend modes in HTML and SVG varies wildly between browsers and is often not anti-aliased or is too low resolution on high-DPI displays.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe 2D canvas API is an immediate mode API instead of a retained mode API so all geometry has to be re-uploaded to the graphics card every frame. This is needlessly wasteful and can become a bottleneck.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eText layout is \u003ca href=\"https://css-tricks.com/font-rendering-differences-firefox-vs-ie-vs-safari/\"\u003einconsistent between browsers\u003c/a\u003e and is even inconsistent between the \u003ca href=\"https://blog.typekit.com/2010/10/21/type-rendering-web-browsers/\"\u003esame browser on different platforms\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe wanted to be able to add features such as \u003ca href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ivV6l.png\"\u003eangular gradients\u003c/a\u003e which are not supported by any of these rendering APIs.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eInstead of attempting to get one of these to work, we implemented everything from scratch using WebGL. Our renderer is a highly-optimized tile-based engine with support for masking, blurring, dithered gradients, blend modes, nested layer opacity, and more. All rendering is done on the GPU and is fully anti-aliased. Internally our code looks a lot like a browser inside a browser; we have our own DOM, our own compositor, our own text layout engine, and we’re thinking about adding a render tree just like the one browsers use to render HTML.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"browsers\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#browsers\"\u003eBrowsers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe functionality of the web platform is still catching up to native platforms and there are unfortunately still a few gaps here and there. While we don’t have the resources to fill some of the larger gaps, I still try to fix what I can when it makes sense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore I started working on Figma, high-DPI custom cursors were really broken on the web.

We’re also announcing the funding we’ve raised to date ($18MM) from Greylock, Index, OATV and some amazing angels including Jeff Weiner, DJ Patil, Adam Nash and Soleio Cuervo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEver since Writely (now called Google Docs) launched ten years ago, I’ve believed that all software should be online, real-time and collaborative. Creative tools haven’t made the leap because the browser has not been powerful enough. Now, with WebGL, everything has changed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI first glimpsed the power of WebGL in April 2011. My classmate, Evan Wallace, had just returned to the Brown CS lab after a weekend hackathon. He pulled me aside and showed me how he had re-implemented a server side image processing API in WebGL. “You know,” said Evan, “we could use this thing to build creative tools in the browser.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis made my ears perk up. Over the next year, Evan and I talked constantly about how we could make creative tools accessible using WebGL and, with the support of the Thiel Fellowship, we decided to start a company together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe quickly realized the biggest pain point designers face on a day-to-day basis is collaboration with their teams. These problems are further exacerbated because the role of the designer is more cross-functional than ever before. Designers are at the center of the organization: on any given day they might find themselves sharing assets with another designer, adjusting copy for marketing or making redlines for an engineer. While engineers have built all sorts of tools which make it easy for them to work as a team, designers are still in the dark ages when it comes to collaborative workflows. From designing to commenting to sharing to storing, no single tool tackles the entire workflow in one place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"introducing-figma\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#introducing-figma\"\u003eIntroducing Figma\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we started working on Figma, we knew it was possible to build a fast and stable graphics tool in the browser, but we had no idea how hard it would be.

After dogfooding Figma internally for the past eighteen months and working closely with alpha customers, I’m confident we’ve reached this high bar.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the technical achievement of building a vector based UI design tool in the browser is exciting, I’m even more excited by the collaborative possibilities we’re starting to unlock. Whether you’re sharing a design with a link, giving contextual feedback or setting shared brand colors for your team to use, Figma makes it easy to work with your team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"what-s-next\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#what-s-next\"\u003eWhat’s Next\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, we’re announcing our Preview Release: a way for teams to get early access to Figma and help shape our product roadmap.
