At best, we have had to change the way we work and play, becoming uncomfortably close with loneliness. Many of us have lost clients and jobs... or at worst, even lost friends and family. Amid the fear, we found it hard to feel peace, joy, and hope.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere in the US, we have fought injustice and inequality: a painful, messy, necessary transformation. The rift we\u0026#39;ve exposed with our neighbors, friends, and loved ones is a fresh wound. Each time healing begins, something comes along and rips it open again. Amid the anger, it has been hard to be kind, gracious, and empathetic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis year has seen enough to overwhelm anyone: economic turmoil, raging wildfires, terrible hurricanes, global leadership crisis, and civil unrest.

Doing the right thing is usually hard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy life has repeatedly reinforced this lesson: Difficulty always precedes greatness, but greatness never follows a difficulty abandoned. We are responsible to persevere through the obstacles life puts in front of us; To do the hard thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt can be hard to feel hopeful, but without hope, we are hopeless. It can be hard to be kind, but without kindness, it is impossible to heal together. It can be hard to give thanks, but celebrating the present and experiencing joy become much harder without gratitude.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne common Thanksgiving tradition is to take turns around the dinner table, sharing what we are thankful for.

How often do we practice gratitude?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePracticing gratitude yields so many incredible benefits: blocking negative emotions, reducing depression, creating more meaningful relationships, and magnifying happiness \u003ca href=\"https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-appreciation/\"\u003eare just a few\u003c/a\u003e. Gratitude, it seems, could be the therapy many of us need this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s within our reach, but we must take action. This Thanksgiving, I invite you to share what you are grateful for. Share it in person, over the phone, on social media, or say it out loud.

I\u0026#39;m grateful for my mentor, Chris. He inspires me to improve continuously, to reach for greatness in everything I do. I\u0026#39;m grateful for our team here at The Futur.

Because of you, we\u0026#39;re able to try new things. We\u0026#39;re able to fail. We\u0026#39;re able to build an incredible community together. Every video you watch, every comment you leave, every purchase you make, every story you share may seem insignificant, but rest assured: it means the world to us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSincerely, thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s so much more I could write, but it\u0026#39;s your turn.

From all of us here at The Futur, we hope you have a warm, happy Thanksgiving and a healthy, joyful holiday season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFind hope. Be kind. Give thanks.

Even after all the horrible events, ugliness that is being expressed by people, sadness that is surrounding us all, they keep me happy and at peace. I\u0026#39;m glad we are all safe and healthy. I\u0026#39;m also grateful for the friends I have. No matter the amount of time that goes by, I can pick up the phone and have a fantastic conversation, just like when we were in high school. Even though my in-person bubble is small, my distanced bubble is huge and I\u0026#39;m truly thankful. I\u0026#39;m thankful for being able to work through this pandemic. This bit of normalcy keeps me sane.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Monica Martin, Head of HR and Bookkeeping\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am grateful for my family, friends and co-workers, who have been vital in keeping me sane this year. I’m grateful for the roof over my head, good movies, good books, and the internet that has helped keep me in contact with people, even as we are stuck inside. I’m grateful for the community that is The Futur. To be able to interact with people all around the world, even in a time as precarious as this, and to know that what we do is helping people. I’m grateful for cat videos on Instagram, and last, but certainly not least, I am grateful for pizza. I feel that needs no further explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Stewart Schuster, Video Producer\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am grateful for both tears and smiles in my life. Whatever happens, it makes me feel alive. My son\u0026#39;s laughter wakes me up each morning. He waves at me before running down the stairs, after stealing my phone so he can dance to some song on Soundcloud. He\u0026#39;s almost 2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am thankful for my relationship with my father. It\u0026#39;s been a bumpy road these past 17 years, but we brought it back. I also keep my brother and sister close to my heart. We are all different, but at our core, we are very much alike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy godfather and godmother are precious to me. They support me, no questions asked. My friends, they accept me. And that is what one needs sometimes. Just being accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are a small team here at The Futur. That\u0026#39;s what makes this special. I\u0026#39;ve learned a lot and still am. I couldn\u0026#39;t ask for better people to work with and learn from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, I cherish you, mother.

The thank you is for your support of The Futur. Spiritually, financially, or otherwise. Without you, kind stranger, we would be nothing but a bunch of lonely dummies talking amongst ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m proud of you because if you’re reading this, it means you’re taking steps to better yourself. Or your business. Or you just like to read lengthy design blogs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhatever the case may be, good for you. And I hope you’re able to take a moment to appreciate that fact.

I wasn’t sure what to write about and if I should be serious or funny. I’ll leave the serious with the more serious people. I’m thankful for routine, I’m thankful for self-care, I’m thankful for work, I’m thankful for weights, I’m thankful for all the little beautiful things in life that pass me by every day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope you find some things today to be thankful for, and to not just use today to be thankful, but to use more days to be thankful.

The need to appreciate what we have, rather than what we\u0026#39;ve had to give up. And to appreciate our loved ones, even if we haven\u0026#39;t felt their hugs for far too long.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m so thankful for my family and friends for always finding ways to feel connected, no matter how far apart we are.

I’m thankful for having this opportunity to work with a super cool, super smart team. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m thankful to work with this awesome community. I’ve met many of you from across the world in Spain, Italy, Poland, UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Canada and beyond. It becomes so real when we meet in person, and to be greeted like we’ve been friends forever. When I just started working at The Futur, I didn’t expect what we were doing would connect me to so many great people. Thank you. YOU are the reason!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Mark Contreras, Producer\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHey y’all, I’m grateful to be doing what I like in a place I love with people I admire. For all the things I’ve learned from working here because otherwise I wouldn’t have made it through this pandemic without adopting the mindset tip from Errol Gerson. “If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor my generous second family here at The Futur, for looking out for little ol’ me and always lending a hand when I need it.

I felt really low lows. I cried a lot. I wanted to rid the world of the doom and gloom we were all feeling. Gratitude was never on my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, though, I’m reminded of all the positives, and I’m feeling pretty darn grateful. For my family and friends, who I’d be nothing without. Their love and support keeps me going, and every second with them is a blessing. For my fiancé, who always pushes me to be a better version of myself and makes me laugh uncontrollably. For my cats, Jake and Lucy, who give the best snuggles. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m grateful for the friends I’ve made here at The Futur, who have taught me so much, it kind of blows my mind the amount I’ve learned from them.

Gratitude, it seems, could be the therapy many of us need this year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0026#39;s within our reach, but we must take action. This Thanksgiving, I invite you to share what you are grateful for. Share it in person, over the phone, on social media, or say it out loud. No hashtag, no contrived marketing effort: The five minutes you spend may spark the change you need.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAllow me to start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m grateful for my wife, Elise. She is my backbone, my heart, and my why. I\u0026#39;m grateful for my kids, Willow and Olivia. They are not only joyful: they \u003cem\u003eare joy\u003c/em\u003e. I\u0026#39;m grateful for my mentor, Chris. He inspires me to improve continuously, to reach for greatness in everything I do. I\u0026#39;m grateful for our team here at The Futur. Nothing is impossible for them, and I\u0026#39;m honored to have them by my side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m grateful for you. Yep, that\u0026#39;s right: you. Because of you, we\u0026#39;re able to try new things. We\u0026#39;re able to fail. We\u0026#39;re able to build an incredible community together. Every video you watch, every comment you leave, every purchase you make, every story you share may seem insignificant, but rest assured: it means the world to us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSincerely, thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s so much more I could write, but it\u0026#39;s your turn. Please don\u0026#39;t forget to practice gratitude today. From all of us here at The Futur, we hope you have a warm, happy Thanksgiving and a healthy, joyful holiday season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFind hope. Be kind. Give thanks. Even if it\u0026#39;s hard.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e—Ben Burns\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eI asked the rest of our team at The Futur what they were thankful for. Here is what they wrote:\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m super grateful for my husband and 2 daughters. Even after all the horrible events, ugliness that is being expressed by people, sadness that is surrounding us all, they keep me happy and at peace. I\u0026#39;m glad we are all safe and healthy. I\u0026#39;m also grateful for the friends I have. No matter the amount of time that goes by, I can pick up the phone and have a fantastic conversation, just like when we were in high school. Even though my in-person bubble is small, my distanced bubble is huge and I\u0026#39;m truly thankful. I\u0026#39;m thankful for being able to work through this pandemic. This bit of normalcy keeps me sane.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Monica Martin, Head of HR and Bookkeeping\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am grateful for my family, friends and co-workers, who have been vital in keeping me sane this year. I’m grateful for the roof over my head, good movies, good books, and the internet that has helped keep me in contact with people, even as we are stuck inside. I’m grateful for the community that is The Futur. To be able to interact with people all around the world, even in a time as precarious as this, and to know that what we do is helping people. I’m grateful for cat videos on Instagram, and last, but certainly not least, I am grateful for pizza. I feel that needs no further explanation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Stewart Schuster, Video Producer\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am grateful for both tears and smiles in my life. Whatever happens, it makes me feel alive. My son\u0026#39;s laughter wakes me up each morning. He waves at me before running down the stairs, after stealing my phone so he can dance to some song on Soundcloud. He\u0026#39;s almost 2.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am thankful for my relationship with my father. It\u0026#39;s been a bumpy road these past 17 years, but we brought it back. I also keep my brother and sister close to my heart. We are all different, but at our core, we are very much alike.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy godfather and godmother are precious to me. They support me, no questions asked. My friends, they accept me. And that is what one needs sometimes. Just being accepted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are a small team here at The Futur. That\u0026#39;s what makes this special. I\u0026#39;ve learned a lot and still am. I couldn\u0026#39;t ask for better people to work with and learn from.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, I cherish you, mother. I can only imagine how you would be around my son.\u003cbr/\u003eSmiles and tears, it\u0026#39;s all about feeling alive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Alex Burlui, Marketing Coordinator\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHello, internet stranger. Greg Gunn here. We’re supposed to write what we’re grateful for in this mighty blog post. But I’m not going to do that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t get me wrong, I am grateful. For all the wonderful people and opportunities in my life. My health and my anxious sense of sanity. Especially during this miserable turd of a year.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll I want to say, to you reading this right now, is thank you and that I’m proud of you. The thank you is for your support of The Futur. Spiritually, financially, or otherwise. Without you, kind stranger, we would be nothing but a bunch of lonely dummies talking amongst ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I’m proud of you because if you’re reading this, it means you’re taking steps to better yourself. Or your business. Or you just like to read lengthy design blogs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhatever the case may be, good for you. And I hope you’re able to take a moment to appreciate that fact. Maybe even give yourself a hug while you’re at it. Be well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Greg Gunn, Creative Director\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHope this finds you well. I wasn’t sure what to write about and if I should be serious or funny. I’ll leave the serious with the more serious people. I’m thankful for routine, I’m thankful for self-care, I’m thankful for work, I’m thankful for weights, I’m thankful for all the little beautiful things in life that pass me by every day.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope you find some things today to be thankful for, and to not just use today to be thankful, but to use more days to be thankful. I appreciate you and hope you have a thankful life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Ricky Lucas, Cinematographer \u0026amp; Editor\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis Thanksgiving feels more needed than ever. The need to appreciate what we have, rather than what we\u0026#39;ve had to give up. And to appreciate our loved ones, even if we haven\u0026#39;t felt their hugs for far too long.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m so thankful for my family and friends for always finding ways to feel connected, no matter how far apart we are. And for my partner, Dewi, for continuously pushing me to shoot for the moon, even when I don\u0026#39;t believe in myself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m thankful for you, Futur fam. Every Instagram like, comment, anecdote and message of gratitude makes me so proud to be able to share the wisdom and teachings of our Futur team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hear you, and I\u0026#39;m with you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot only am I thankful for The Futur, I\u0026#39;m honored to work for a company that rises to every occasion and strives to be better than we were before.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Elle Money, Social Media Marketer\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI am thankful for here and now. For you and I. For this world we share. Another day. Another opportunity. Another chance to write a new page in life. I\u0026#39;m thankful that you are all part of my story, and I\u0026#39;m thankful to be part of yours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Matthew Encina, Chief Content Officer\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m grateful for the people in my life. My wife, who literally saves kids’ lives, my family who I love AF, and my loyal friends who are there, through thick and thin. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMy coworkers at The Futur have become a second family to me, especially during this pandemic. I’m thankful for having this opportunity to work with a super cool, super smart team. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m thankful to work with this awesome community. I’ve met many of you from across the world in Spain, Italy, Poland, UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Canada and beyond. It becomes so real when we meet in person, and to be greeted like we’ve been friends forever. When I just started working at The Futur, I didn’t expect what we were doing would connect me to so many great people. Thank you. YOU are the reason!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Mark Contreras, Producer\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHey y’all, I’m grateful to be doing what I like in a place I love with people I admire. For all the things I’ve learned from working here because otherwise I wouldn’t have made it through this pandemic without adopting the mindset tip from Errol Gerson. “If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.” \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor my generous second family here at The Futur, for looking out for little ol’ me and always lending a hand when I need it. I’m thankful for my work hubby Ricky for being like a bigger brother to me and for sharing his delicious cooking recipes with me. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m grateful to still be able to connect with family, cousins, and friends because they makes me feel at home without physically being there. I’m ETERNALLY grateful for my parents for bringing me sweet Houston comfort food when they visited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly I’m grateful y’all appreciate the livestreams because y’all have no idea how much chaos goes into it. Thank y’all for doing everything that you because this wouldn’t be possible without y’all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e— Jona Garcia, Cinematographer \u0026amp; Editor\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’ll be honest: the start of this year kicked my butt down the street and back. I felt really low lows. I cried a lot. I wanted to rid the world of the doom and gloom we were all feeling. Gratitude was never on my mind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eToday, though, I’m reminded of all the positives, and I’m feeling pretty darn grateful. For my family and friends, who I’d be nothing without. Their love and support keeps me going, and every second with them is a blessing. For my fiancé, who always pushes me to be a better version of myself and makes me laugh uncontrollably. For my cats, Jake and Lucy, who give the best snuggles. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m grateful for the friends I’ve made here at The Futur, who have taught me so much, it kind of blows my mind the amount I’ve learned from them. (Seriously, thank you, you guys.) And for you, our Futur fam, for your never-ending support, encouragement and positivity. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m thankful for good food (mainly soup and rice \u0026amp; beans), and the greatest album released this year: \u003cem\u003ePositions\u003c/em\u003e by Ariana Grande.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though we’ve been tested over and over again this year, I hope today we remember all the good that’s right in front of us, the good we can give to each other no matter the distance, and the good we can bring into the new year.

Enable alt tags for images\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlt tags don’t just improve search ratings. They’re also accommodating to visually-impaired visitors using a screen reader with their browser. If your webpage has decorative images that don’t add information to the content, add an empty alt text field (alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) so that assistive technologies ignore them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.

Autoplay may also make a website completely inaccessible for people using screen-reading software.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Enable controls for multimedia files\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccessible media players provide a user interface that works without a mouse through a speech interface when the page is zoomed larger, and with screen readers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Provide captions for multimedia files\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eText versions of speech, like subtitles, along with other important audio content allow different media to be accessible to people with a hearing impairment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Follow a strict outline hierarchy with headlines\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeadings are much more than big bold titles. They provide a solid structure to the webpage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom an accessibility viewpoint, the structure in the code should align with the visual presentation and make sense as a “table of contents” for the page.

For example, blind people often use screen readers: technology that converts display text into synthesized speech or refreshable Braille. People with motor disabilities can use puff-and-sip systems—tools that work similarly to a joystick, but controlled with breath. They recognize sips or puffs and translate them into mouse clicks or keyboard characters. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‘Web access’ is an umbrella term encompassing “websites, tools, and technologies that are designed and developed so people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web and contribute to it.” Still, web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul role=\"list\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eOn mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens or different input modes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePeople with temporary disabilities such as a broken arm or lost glasses.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePeople with situational limitations—those in bright sunlight or in an environment where audio is not allowed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePeople on a slow, limited, or even expensive bandwidth connection.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Address Accessibility?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn making the Internet a place of equal opportunities, there are many practical benefits to making your website accessible.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e• Accessibility enhances the brand voice\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow more than ever, it’s important to take a stance on inclusion.

In fact, accessibility lawsuits are on the rise. In 2017, the number of such lawsuits filed in US federal courts totaled about 800 cases.

Iterating over several years behind the scenes, the company invested its resources to develop the predecessor of VoiceOver, the world’s first gesture-based screen reader. With it, users could interact with objects on the screen and intuitively gauge their location and context from audio cues.

In 1999, the W3 Consortium released its first set of \u003ca href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/\"\u003eWeb Accessibility Guidelines\u003c/a\u003e, which has been updated several times since then. Based on these guidelines, we’ve put together a general checklist to make sure your website is accessible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Enable alt tags for images\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlt tags don’t just improve search ratings. They’re also accommodating to visually-impaired visitors using a screen reader with their browser. If your webpage has decorative images that don’t add information to the content, add an empty alt text field (alt=\u0026#34;\u0026#34;) so that assistive technologies ignore them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Don’t use autoplay\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAutoplay content can be both irritating and a real barrier to access for people with disabilities. Videos, sounds, and animations that automatically start can be distressing for users with cognitive impairments, impacting their ability to concentrate. Autoplay may also make a website completely inaccessible for people using screen-reading software.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Enable controls for multimedia files\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccessible media players provide a user interface that works without a mouse through a speech interface when the page is zoomed larger, and with screen readers. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Provide captions for multimedia files\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eText versions of speech, like subtitles, along with other important audio content allow different media to be accessible to people with a hearing impairment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Follow a strict outline hierarchy with headlines\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHeadings are much more than big bold titles. They provide a solid structure to the webpage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom an accessibility viewpoint, the structure in the code should align with the visual presentation and make sense as a “table of contents” for the page. Make sure your heading levels follow a document outline so screen readers can identify headings and read out the content. \u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, an \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt; tag would designate a subsection within an \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt; section—meaning you should never come across an \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt; that isn’t preceded by an \u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;.\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6. Don’t use images for text\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf visually-impaired visitors can opt to scale up images, they become blurry and pixelated (vector images won’t lose quality when scaled up). Text must display properly when enlarged, so keep that in mind when choosing fonts and devising the composition and layout.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts’ \u003ca href=\"https://visibility-design.dk/\"\u003eCentre for Visibility Design\u003c/a\u003e has some enlightening and engrossing research on text legibility.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e7. Allow zoom without affecting the layout\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsers with impaired vision may prefer to enlarge their browser text or zoom into page content to make it easier to read. Browsers accomplish this in one of two ways: enlarging the font size only, or zooming into the entire page and applying responsive styles, as appropriate. The code should not interfere with the browser’s default settings of enlarging content.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8. Ensure high contrast between objects and the background\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome colors and color pairs may confuse visitors with color blindness.

Don’t hesitate to add the Lightbox feature to images—an overlay effect that highlights images by filling the screen and dimming out the rest of the page. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9. Make sure color is not used as a prompt or a way to convey information \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor people with low vision, color perception deficiencies, or color blindness, they struggle to navigate their way through color-drenched content. Make sure that color is not the only prompt used to convey information (e.g. avoid instructions like “select the red circle to continue”). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10.

Instead of estimating one number, say a range of numbers, and follow that with, “does a figure in this range work for you?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s say the client is looking to have a website designed.

Creation. \u003c/strong\u003eThe most important part of my process was the application of what I learned.

Intentional consumption. \u003c/strong\u003eI read each post with a clear goal in mind: to extract a lesson, and to make observations about Seth’s writing style. Actively seeking information helped me pay attention to what I was reading, versus just copying it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. Distilling and reflection. \u003c/strong\u003eI took notes to summarize what I learned in every post, which forced me to recall the information I had just read.

I also took notes on my thoughts and feelings, which helped me make adjustments to my process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Creation. \u003c/strong\u003eThe most important part of my process was the application of what I learned. The moment I started writing my articles, emulating Seth’s style of writing, I committed to memory what I had been copying and observing. That’s because I went from passive learning to active learning. \u003cem\u003eThe most effective way to retain information.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Adjust. \u003c/strong\u003eWhen you design a new system to follow, you have to make iterative adjustments to improve its effectiveness. When I noticed that chasing a daily quota of 52 entries became counter-productive towards my goal, I changed my process to focus on the quality of consumption, \u003cem\u003enot the quantity.\u003c/em\u003e This adjustment greatly improved my relationship with the exercise and what I got out of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eUnexpected afterglow\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring this one week challenge, I published 3 original articles. \u003cem\u003eThat’s as much as I normally do in a whole year.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd even though the challenge is over, I’ve experienced a bit of an afterglow effect from it.

The challenge for most of us is that we’re risk-averse. And we look for all the reasons why now is not a good time to pursue our next big idea.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2014, I pitched an idea to the band Coldplay, that I’d design an interactive music video for their song “Ink.” At the time, I really had no clue how to make it. I was nervous, cause I had very little experience in interactive design. And I almost pulled out of the project because, for a moment, I doubted my ability to deliver.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut I jumped in head first, and I believed that I could figure it out. My resourcefulness kicked in. I called everyone in my network. I did a lot of research on the technology. And a few months later, I created my \u003ca href=\"https://www.coldplay.com/ink/\"\u003efirst-ever interactive music video\u003c/a\u003e. Had I closed up and avoided risk, because of fear and doubt, I would’ve missed out on one of the most rewarding projects of my life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ow2cZxpY2TE\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat \u003cstrong\u003e“will figure it out”\u003c/strong\u003e mentality, I believe, is our superpower as creative human beings. We can see possibilities, where others cannot. And can come up with novel solutions to challenges, when we’re in a pinch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you have an opportunity in front of you, have confidence in yourself. Start before you’re ready, and push yourself beyond your comfort zone. Cause when you do, you’ll grow beyond your current abilities, and you’ll surprise yourself. You’ll realize how good you really are.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLesson 2: Failure is not the end. It’s a lesson for your future self.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFailure sucks. It’s embarrassing, demoralizing and can bring your life to a screeching halt if you let it. \u003c/strong\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2007, right after graduating college, I decided to start a design studio called, BORN, with my school mates.\u003cem\u003e \u003c/em\u003eLife was good.

The phones stopped ringing. We stopped getting clients. And I realized everything I didn\u0026#39;t know about running a business – especially in tough times\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur business became a burden rather than bringing us joy. So with a heavy heart, we decided to close our doors in 2009, and say goodbye to our little design studio.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile that experience left a deep scar on me, it was a humbling lesson that I\u0026#39;ll remember for life. It taught me that I’m not invincible, and that there will be challenges that will appear in front of me, that I won’t be prepared for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat experience revealed many gaps in my skills and knowledge that I wasn’t aware of at the time, but those became the things I worked on in the following years of my career. Now I’ve become more comfortable with disruption and pivoting when things change.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re experiencing failure right now, just know, you’ll get through it. You’ll be stronger after it. Be willing to accept the situation and learn from it.

While it is important, it’s also sometimes more difficult to read. Try to keep the use of uppercase for information on your layout that needs special attention. Keep it to a word or two in a section, not every word in it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, you can use uppercase to your advantage. If you are trying to draw attention to a title, for example, then using all uppercase would be appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to make centered text work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re centering the main copy down the page, you’re surrendering your control over how a shape is built. But there is a way to make it work. You can have your content in the center of the page, but if you want to control the shape that forms from it, justify the text left so there\u0026#39;s a straight line down the side, rather than the text having various starting points down the line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatch the full critique from week 6 here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgAHGF6ZXk8\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeek 7: Experimental\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor our seventh and final week of critiques, students were encouraged to think outside the box and get experimental with their designs.

Dadaism is a symbol of rebellion and artistic freedom; it celebrates the artist’s ability to break from the tight structures that were commonplace before the war.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany designers want to express their artistic side freely, and you should. Before you do, though, take a look at some of the layouts that came from the early days of Dadaism. You’ll see how designers were experimental yet purposeful in their execution of their layouts.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMake your elements talk to one another\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery layout you design is only impactful when every single element works together. As Milka points out in this week’s critique, she notes that she sees a lot of islands. There needs to be unity for your design to be both visually engaging and communicative. How do your elements relate to one another?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatch week 4\u0026#39;s critique session here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJnSsdI7B5I\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeek 5: Any Weight, Any Point Size\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eTypography students walk into the the fifth week of critiques with looser parameters to work within. Chris and Milka review the work from multiple students, the good and the bad, to help you learn from your mistakes and where you can improve. Here\u0026#39;s what we took away from week five:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSquint your eyes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo see where you can polish up your layout, zoom out from the artboard and squint your eyes. What do you see first? What other elements are capturing your attention?

In this case, with the title REZN8, separating the 8 and changing its orientation tells us it\u0026#39;s not related to the rest of the title, REZN.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Piano Effect—and why you should avoid it\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJust like piano keys changing from white to black, you want to avoid your typography following this same look. If you have a list of copy changing from bold to light every line, while it creates contrast and repetition, it becomes harder to look at, especially when grouped together. In this case, Milka advises implementing a gradient of weights instead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatch week 5\u0026#39;s critique here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGKOGXWLVlU\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeek 6: Rules \u0026amp; Shapes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur second to last round of typography critiques kicks off with reviewing the concept of grouping sections based on importance and hierarchy using rules and shapes.

While it is important, it’s also sometimes more difficult to read. Try to keep the use of uppercase for information on your layout that needs special attention. Keep it to a word or two in a section, not every word in it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the same time, you can use uppercase to your advantage. If you are trying to draw attention to a title, for example, then using all uppercase would be appropriate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to make centered text work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re centering the main copy down the page, you’re surrendering your control over how a shape is built. But there is a way to make it work. You can have your content in the center of the page, but if you want to control the shape that forms from it, justify the text left so there\u0026#39;s a straight line down the side, rather than the text having various starting points down the line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatch the full critique from week 6 here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgAHGF6ZXk8\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeek 7: Experimental\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor our seventh and final week of critiques, students were encouraged to think outside the box and get experimental with their designs. Over the course of these past seven weeks, students have made major strides and improvements in their skills, but there\u0026#39;s still work to do. Milka and Chris join forces one last time to send the typography students on their way with new perspectives, ideas, and an understanding of how to level up their typography skills. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe biggest takeaway from this last week was to let go of any and all fears when approaching layout design. As Milka puts it, it\u0026#39;s a layout; no one is going to get hurt. She candidly leaves students with some words of wisdom: \u0026#34;if you\u0026#39;re not having fun, you\u0026#39;re not doing it right.\u0026#34; That\u0026#39;s a motto we can definitely get behind.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWatch the full critique from week 7 here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QjKNz980Bu4\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant your typography work critiqued by the pros?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/Type01_bl\"\u003eSign up for our Typography 01 course\u003c/a\u003e for your chance to participate in future critique sessions like this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

If you tend to fuel your body with energy drinks, potato chips, and M\u0026amp;M’s, your productivity will continuously crash. A can of Red Bull might help you complete tonight’s project, but it won’t help you achieve adequate results in the long run.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to boost productivity, increase your intake of the foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals. To fuel your brain and increase the attention concentration, try consuming the following products on a regular basis:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul role=\"list\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eBerries (e.g., blueberries, raspberries, strawberries)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNuts (e.g., almonds, cashews, walnuts)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSeeds (e.g., chia seeds, flax seeds, sunflower seeds)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAvocados\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhole grains (e.g., brown rice, oatmeal)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGreens (e.g., broccoli, kale)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOily fish (e.g., salmon, tuna, sardines)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDark chocolate\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eTry to eat processed food less often, and reduce the consumption of sugars and carbs.

So if you want to work effectively, you shouldn’t skip your workouts. Try to stay physically active all week long, and you will improve divergent and convergent thinking – the two basic components of creative thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s worth mentioning that you shouldn’t force yourself to do sports. Instead, find a kind of physical activity that you really enjoy. For instance, if working out at the gym isn’t your thing, you can attend Zumba classes or practice yoga at home. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t like sports at all, try something simple like walking. Walk 15,000 steps a day, and it will be enough. Just don’t sit in front of your computer all day long! Do at least some physical movements. Your brain and body need that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChallenge yourself to fight your laziness. Find a way to motivate yourself to start exercising.

But if your productivity is low, find a spot in your house to create a small office. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fact, you don’t even need to have a spare room. The balcony, attic room, part of your living room, or any other corner all work well for this purpose. The spot for your home office should fit a small computer table with a comfy chair, and it should have access to natural light.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery time you step into your “home office”, your brain will turn on the “working mode”. It will help you to focus on your project and immerse yourself in the day’s work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBlock social media\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are over three billion social media users on the web.

If you check your social media profiles multiple times a day, it comes as no surprise that you can’t focus on your work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLuckily, there is a solution that can save you. There are apps and tools like Focusme, Offtime, Appblock that help to block the sites you use the most for a specific period of time. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor instance, if you work from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. and want to get rid of your Instagram addiction, you can install the app that will block access to social media sites.

It will help you to stay organized and deliver projects on time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeep in mind that you should schedule not only the hours of the work but also hours (or minutes) of the rest.

When you spend most of the time in one place, it may make you feel stuck, and it may hold you back from progressing in work.

Think of them as moodboards taken to the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStylescapes bridge the gap between your ideas and your client’s. They help to get both of you to agree on the design direction before you design anything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe use Stylescapes for virtually every design project we touch. They’re a vital piece to our creative process and how we keep our clients in the loop of where each project is headed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re not already incorporating Stylescapes into your design process, stick around. You’re about to find out why you and your clients keep butting heads, and how you can significantly simplify your design projects going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Problem with Your Process\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow many times have your clients said something like, “this isn’t what I pictured?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re in a discovery session with a client, there’s a lot that can get lost in translation. They say one thing, but you interpret it as something else entirely. Then when you break from the meeting, you jump into designing and prepare to knock their socks off with what you’ve made.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you present your deliverable, though, they’re not on board. They ask you to try again. They may even do a little research of their own and tell you what to do based on what they found. You keep editing, revising, making last-minute adjustments, and presenting new concepts to them, but you’re not making any progress. You’ve lost focus on what this project is supposed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt that point, you’ve worked beyond the agreed scope, your client’s feeling frustrated, and you’re on the verge of calling it quits. Is any of this sounding familiar?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee, without Stylescapes, there’s no direction to agree on. There’s no transparency or exchange of ideas for the design. And if there’s anything we’ve learned working with clients, it’s that they want to know where the design direction is headed. This is where Stylescapes play a critical role.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5e7bd54183ca53a1bc7922ad_IM_Stylescape_ricky.jpg\" alt=\"Example brand identity stylescape for Indy Mogul.\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou Need to Learn Your Client’s Language\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen your client says “this isn’t what I pictured” you need to figure out what that is before you head to the drawing board. You don’t need a crystal ball or some magic spell to step inside their brains. You need to do something about your discovery process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough asking questions, you slowly start to figure out what your clients mean with each answer, but you can’t get the full picture with their words alone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reality is you and your client don’t speak the same language. You’re coming from a variety of perspectives as a designer, strategist, and problem-solver. You might think you know more than your client in terms of the best direction for the project, but you don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, they’re coming to you to lean on your expertise and design talent, but the fate of their business is in your hands. Don’t forget that clients put their trust in you to deliver something that can squash whatever challenge they’re facing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen they make comments like, “I like the minimalist style,” or “I love so-and-so’s brand,” it’s important that you understand exactly what that means.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e‍\u003cstrong\u003eStylescapes Tell You What Your Clients Want\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can essentially decode your client’s words with Stylescapes. Instead of coming back from the discovery session with a deliverable, you come back with one or a few Stylescapes to essentially ask them, “Is that what you were thinking?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStylescapes are meant to generate some sort of emotional response from the client when they see what’s in front of them. They’re also there to serve as a point of reference to establish the overall look and feel of the brand identity, digital product, music video, or whatever it is you’re designing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStylescapes open the door to a collusion of ideas, giving you and your client the chance to collaborate and communicate clearly and effectively. Your client can point to a specific element or an entire Stylescape and tell you, with zero hesitation, whether they like it or not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRather than continue to guess what their words and ideas look like, you can find certain images, colors, or typefaces that visually represent what they’re thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can bridge the gap between what they say versus what they mean, get them to see what you see, and jump into the design process with more confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet Approval Before You Start Working\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn top of that crystal-clear confirmation that you and your client are on the same page, you also get the added bonus of a verbal sign-off. When your client points to a Stylescape and confidently says, “that’s the direction I want to go in,” that’s your green light.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll too often designers try to read their client’s minds. They don’t always get a full ‘yes’ to move forward, which then sets the course for an endless cycle of revisions, headaches, and lost time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s clear something up: we’re not saying clients dictate the design process. It’s quite the contrary. Like we mentioned before, clients want to be involved. They want to make sure their needs and concerns are heard, and the best way to do that is to give them the opportunity to voice their opinions. When your process is more transparent, clients trust your open-door approach more easily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce you show clients a few samples of what the final design could look like, it only gets them more excited to see the finished product.

Think of them as moodboards taken to the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStylescapes bridge the gap between your ideas and your client’s. They help to get both of you to agree on the design direction before you design anything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe use Stylescapes for virtually every design project we touch. They’re a vital piece to our creative process and how we keep our clients in the loop of where each project is headed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re not already incorporating Stylescapes into your design process, stick around. You’re about to find out why you and your clients keep butting heads, and how you can significantly simplify your design projects going forward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Problem with Your Process\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow many times have your clients said something like, “this isn’t what I pictured?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re in a discovery session with a client, there’s a lot that can get lost in translation. They say one thing, but you interpret it as something else entirely. Then when you break from the meeting, you jump into designing and prepare to knock their socks off with what you’ve made.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you present your deliverable, though, they’re not on board. They ask you to try again. They may even do a little research of their own and tell you what to do based on what they found. You keep editing, revising, making last-minute adjustments, and presenting new concepts to them, but you’re not making any progress. You’ve lost focus on what this project is supposed to be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt that point, you’ve worked beyond the agreed scope, your client’s feeling frustrated, and you’re on the verge of calling it quits. Is any of this sounding familiar?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSee, without Stylescapes, there’s no direction to agree on. There’s no transparency or exchange of ideas for the design. And if there’s anything we’ve learned working with clients, it’s that they want to know where the design direction is headed. This is where Stylescapes play a critical role.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5e7bd54183ca53a1bc7922ad_IM_Stylescape_ricky.jpg\" alt=\"Example brand identity stylescape for Indy Mogul.\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou Need to Learn Your Client’s Language\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen your client says “this isn’t what I pictured” you need to figure out what that is before you head to the drawing board. You don’t need a crystal ball or some magic spell to step inside their brains. You need to do something about your discovery process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThrough asking questions, you slowly start to figure out what your clients mean with each answer, but you can’t get the full picture with their words alone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe reality is you and your client don’t speak the same language. You’re coming from a variety of perspectives as a designer, strategist, and problem-solver. You might think you know more than your client in terms of the best direction for the project, but you don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYes, they’re coming to you to lean on your expertise and design talent, but the fate of their business is in your hands. Don’t forget that clients put their trust in you to deliver something that can squash whatever challenge they’re facing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen they make comments like, “I like the minimalist style,” or “I love so-and-so’s brand,” it’s important that you understand exactly what that means.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e‍\u003cstrong\u003eStylescapes Tell You What Your Clients Want\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can essentially decode your client’s words with Stylescapes. Instead of coming back from the discovery session with a deliverable, you come back with one or a few Stylescapes to essentially ask them, “Is that what you were thinking?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStylescapes are meant to generate some sort of emotional response from the client when they see what’s in front of them. They’re also there to serve as a point of reference to establish the overall look and feel of the brand identity, digital product, music video, or whatever it is you’re designing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStylescapes open the door to a collusion of ideas, giving you and your client the chance to collaborate and communicate clearly and effectively. Your client can point to a specific element or an entire Stylescape and tell you, with zero hesitation, whether they like it or not.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRather than continue to guess what their words and ideas look like, you can find certain images, colors, or typefaces that visually represent what they’re thinking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can bridge the gap between what they say versus what they mean, get them to see what you see, and jump into the design process with more confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet Approval Before You Start Working\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn top of that crystal-clear confirmation that you and your client are on the same page, you also get the added bonus of a verbal sign-off. When your client points to a Stylescape and confidently says, “that’s the direction I want to go in,” that’s your green light.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll too often designers try to read their client’s minds. They don’t always get a full ‘yes’ to move forward, which then sets the course for an endless cycle of revisions, headaches, and lost time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLet’s clear something up: we’re not saying clients dictate the design process. It’s quite the contrary. Like we mentioned before, clients want to be involved. They want to make sure their needs and concerns are heard, and the best way to do that is to give them the opportunity to voice their opinions. When your process is more transparent, clients trust your open-door approach more easily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce you show clients a few samples of what the final design could look like, it only gets them more excited to see the finished product.

When you strive for utmost perfection, it can actually set you back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat you want to label as perfect is not up to you.

Does that seem worth the time?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhat if, instead of spending six hours creating a post, you trim it down to two—maybe even one hour. You can laser-focus in on what you want to publish, and reclaim your productivity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFocus on just getting the content out there, and let the chips fall where they may.

Consistency is key.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe more you iterate on something, the more it sticks in your brain. You’ll be pressed to find other pieces of information to back up or expand on your ideas.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce you start posting more frequently, you will engage your audience.

When a client comes to you in need of a website, you’ll more than likely take on the project--even if you don’t know how to build one yourself, or have anyone on hand who does. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLuckily, there are countless web designers out there. But before you hire one and have them get to work, you’ll need to set up a design brief. By the end of this article, you’ll have a better idea of not only how to write a design brief, but also how to keep the project on track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat is a Design Brief?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eA design brief is a document written by the client that the web designer will use to estimate the amount of time required and the costs associated with a project. The client specifies all their wishes regarding the design and the various features that need to be added.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes, the customer hasn’t fully envisioned the project. The brief allows them to record all their ideas in writing so everyone involved reaches a mutual understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eParts of a Design Brief\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn effective design brief should contain information on the following topics:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul role=\"list\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe target demographics\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAny features you want on the website\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat people can do on the site\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLanguage options\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLogos and color schemes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat tone of voice should be used\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA brief example, or a similar website, and what to try to incorporate\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe budget and deadline\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch4\u003eKeeping the Target Demographics in Mind\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eNowadays, sites fill a variety of niches, partly because there are \u003ca href=\"https://www.speedstartup.org/blog-post/importance-understanding-target-audience/\"\u003eso many different people\u003c/a\u003e. Are you building a site to market to a local audience, or are you trying to grow your brand and reach a larger group? Is the website intended for a younger generation, an older community, or a mix of the two?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are the sort of questions you need to answer in your brief so the person completing the project knows what to do. For example, if you’re building a website for elderly adults to use, you would use a larger font, links embedded into anchor texts are visible to the user, and there shouldn’t be a large amount of background animation because it will be distracting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the exact opposite of what you would do with kids and teens, though. With younger people, you can use animations and use a variety of images. A good designer knows where the fine line is between stunning and cluttered. They would also use bright colors and play with the color scheme to make the site exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eFunctionality \u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eDifferent sites will be capable of doing different things. However, all sites should share some things in common, such as social media plugins, a frequently asked questions tab, contact information, and a navigation tab.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the site is marketing a product, then you should talk to the designer about adding a section for customer reviews. If the site is selling a product, then you need to communicate what forms of payment will be accepted on the website.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re trying to build a launchpad or a news site, then communicate how you want the homepage to look. Should it be various tiles with the names of different articles, or should be it a list going down the page? Also, how should the site be organized? Continuing with the news site example, you may want to include a ribbon with different types of articles, like finance and style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLanguage Options\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegardless of where you live in the world, various groups of people will find their way to your site; it’s important to keep that in mind while writing the brief. Some websites are now including different flags above the navigation ribbon or acronyms of various countries to allow users to translate a website without having to use external software.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy including this feature on your site, the content is more accessible, prompting people to stay on the website longer. If they stay on longer, they’re more likely to browse other sections of the site, or shop around depending on if the site is designed to inform or facilitate commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eUse of Logos and Complementary Color Schemes\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to note this one because a beautiful site could be the difference between someone staying on it or going to a competitor’s website. If using a logo, think about that logo, and communicate with the designer that you want to use a similar color scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf your logo and color scheme don’t complement one another, it creates a sense of disjointedness that will make people shy away from your site. Specifying a color palette in the brief will help avoid this entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eUse of Tone and Style\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis element is important not necessarily for the aesthetic value of the website, but \u003ca href=\"https://3to5marketing.com/freelance-writing-beginners/\"\u003eits readability\u003c/a\u003e. The tone is dependent on two things: the audience and the mood. The way you would write for an adult would be different than how you would address a toddler.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlay around with what words you would use and the order you can communicate the same thing to different people using two different sentences. When building a website that has a young target audience, you’ll have to create shorter sentences and be more direct with what you’re saying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhereas tone is what you’re saying, style is how you say it. Let’s say your website is geared more towards professionals in a certain field. You wouldn’t use exclamation marks or contractions as often as you would in a more casual piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat is because using contractions helps free up the language. The use of \u003cem\u003eit’s\u003c/em\u003e vs. \u003cem\u003eit is\u003c/em\u003e, for example, makes a website seem less rigid. A website will have one of four general styles it’s written in: expository, descriptive, narrative, or persuasive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are many tools and services online like \u003ca href=\"http://writingjudge.com/\"\u003eWritingJudge\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://grammarly.com\"\u003eGrammarly\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.trustmypaper.com/\"\u003eTrustMyPaper\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://bestessay.education/\"\u003eBestEssay.Education\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://hemingwayapp.com\"\u003eHemingway\u003c/a\u003e that can help you calibrate the tone and voice of your copy to the needs of your target audience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCommunicating the style to the web designer will also help them build a background that complements the content written on your website. Style can also refer to the layout itself. Think about elements that you like from outside inspiration and try to have those things incorporated into the website design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScandinavian design, for example, focuses on simplicity, minimalism, and functionally. Its use of sharp lines and a neutral palette gives a clean look to any home, and if these same concepts are applied to the web design process, it creates a sleek and elegant looking site.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eExamples of Websites and Why They’re Designed Well\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are going to focus on two different websites, and what each one did well. There’s the social media titan, Facebook, and the sports website, ESPN.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn excellent example of the concept of the use of designing websites with complementary color schemes to their logo is Facebook. Facebook’s logo has a white letter on a blue background. The pane at the top of the page is blue. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the interface seems cluttered, however, upon closer inspection, the design team did an excellent job of incorporating white space to break up various sections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.espn.com/\"\u003eESPN’s website\u003c/a\u003e also has a lot going on, but everything works well together. You have articles you can read and scores you can check, but there’s also background videos playing to keep you informed on a variety of topics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis site also makes use of smooth transitions, keeping the UI clean. Above the navigation ribbon are scores from a variety of sports, along with a plugin for a variety of fantasy sports leagues. This makes ESPN’s site a one-stop-shop for anything sports-related.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eCommunicating Deadlines \u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eOut of all of the sections in this article, deadlines may be the \u003ca href=\"https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/want-to-show-great-leadership-skills-as-deadline-approaches-try-these-5-communic.html\"\u003ehardest to communicate\u003c/a\u003e. Life happens, and the web designer may be attempting to juggle multiple projects. Because of this, deadlines may not be met. Rather than say the project is due a month from now, say you would like to see progress checks every Thursday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis allows you to see the site as it evolves. By breaking it up into smaller tasks, you can address something you don’t like right during the check-ins, rather than the designer have to tweak their final product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t be afraid to contact the web designer. It’s better to reach out a week before the deadline and find out that the site will be completed late, rather than learning this the day after the due date.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Budget\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere should be two parts of the budget: the cost of the website, and the fee associated with reimbursing the designer for their time. As a general rule, the more detailed a website is, the more you’ll pay for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The more experience someone brings to designing a project, the more their services will cost, but that’s because they\u0026#39;ll be able to deliver a better product.” — Diana Adjadj, freelance UX writer at \u003ca href=\"https://studicus.com/\"\u003eStudicus\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eFinal Thoughts on Web Design Briefs\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eWriting a brief is a time-consuming process, but a necessary one. When you clearly communicate your ideas and goals with the designer, you not only give them an idea of what they’re supposed to build, but you also gain an unbiased sounding board.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis becomes useful when you are talking through what you want to accomplish, and they’re able to give feedback or ask questions that you may have missed. As long as the designer stays on brief and budget, you’re sure to have a website that doesn’t just meet your needs, but exceeds them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eABOUT THE AUTHOR\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eKristin Savage is an English Literature graduate who is interested in writing and planning to publish her own book in the near future. She graduated last year but is already a true expert when it comes to presenting a text in a creative and understandable manner, this is why she’s a senior editor at \u003ca href=\"https://www.grabmyessay.com/buy-research-paper\"\u003eGrab My Essay\u003c/a\u003e, and a regular contributor at \u003ca href=\"https://wowgrade.net/\"\u003eWoWGrade\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://supremedissertations.com/\"\u003eSupreme Dissertations\u003c/a\u003e.

By the end of this article, you’ll have a better idea of not only how to write a design brief, but also how to keep the project on track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eWhat is a Design Brief?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eA design brief is a document written by the client that the web designer will use to estimate the amount of time required and the costs associated with a project. The client specifies all their wishes regarding the design and the various features that need to be added.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes, the customer hasn’t fully envisioned the project. The brief allows them to record all their ideas in writing so everyone involved reaches a mutual understanding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eParts of a Design Brief\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn effective design brief should contain information on the following topics:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul role=\"list\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe target demographics\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAny features you want on the website\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat people can do on the site\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLanguage options\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLogos and color schemes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhat tone of voice should be used\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA brief example, or a similar website, and what to try to incorporate\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe budget and deadline\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch4\u003eKeeping the Target Demographics in Mind\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eNowadays, sites fill a variety of niches, partly because there are \u003ca href=\"https://www.speedstartup.org/blog-post/importance-understanding-target-audience/\"\u003eso many different people\u003c/a\u003e. Are you building a site to market to a local audience, or are you trying to grow your brand and reach a larger group? Is the website intended for a younger generation, an older community, or a mix of the two?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese are the sort of questions you need to answer in your brief so the person completing the project knows what to do. For example, if you’re building a website for elderly adults to use, you would use a larger font, links embedded into anchor texts are visible to the user, and there shouldn’t be a large amount of background animation because it will be distracting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the exact opposite of what you would do with kids and teens, though. With younger people, you can use animations and use a variety of images. A good designer knows where the fine line is between stunning and cluttered. They would also use bright colors and play with the color scheme to make the site exciting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eFunctionality \u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eDifferent sites will be capable of doing different things. However, all sites should share some things in common, such as social media plugins, a frequently asked questions tab, contact information, and a navigation tab.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf the site is marketing a product, then you should talk to the designer about adding a section for customer reviews. If the site is selling a product, then you need to communicate what forms of payment will be accepted on the website.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re trying to build a launchpad or a news site, then communicate how you want the homepage to look. Should it be various tiles with the names of different articles, or should be it a list going down the page? Also, how should the site be organized? Continuing with the news site example, you may want to include a ribbon with different types of articles, like finance and style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLanguage Options\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eRegardless of where you live in the world, various groups of people will find their way to your site; it’s important to keep that in mind while writing the brief. Some websites are now including different flags above the navigation ribbon or acronyms of various countries to allow users to translate a website without having to use external software.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy including this feature on your site, the content is more accessible, prompting people to stay on the website longer. If they stay on longer, they’re more likely to browse other sections of the site, or shop around depending on if the site is designed to inform or facilitate commerce.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eUse of Logos and Complementary Color Schemes\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s important to note this one because a beautiful site could be the difference between someone staying on it or going to a competitor’s website. If using a logo, think about that logo, and communicate with the designer that you want to use a similar color scheme.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf your logo and color scheme don’t complement one another, it creates a sense of disjointedness that will make people shy away from your site. Specifying a color palette in the brief will help avoid this entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eUse of Tone and Style\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis element is important not necessarily for the aesthetic value of the website, but \u003ca href=\"https://3to5marketing.com/freelance-writing-beginners/\"\u003eits readability\u003c/a\u003e. The tone is dependent on two things: the audience and the mood. The way you would write for an adult would be different than how you would address a toddler.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlay around with what words you would use and the order you can communicate the same thing to different people using two different sentences. When building a website that has a young target audience, you’ll have to create shorter sentences and be more direct with what you’re saying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhereas tone is what you’re saying, style is how you say it. Let’s say your website is geared more towards professionals in a certain field. You wouldn’t use exclamation marks or contractions as often as you would in a more casual piece.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat is because using contractions helps free up the language. The use of \u003cem\u003eit’s\u003c/em\u003e vs. \u003cem\u003eit is\u003c/em\u003e, for example, makes a website seem less rigid. A website will have one of four general styles it’s written in: expository, descriptive, narrative, or persuasive.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are many tools and services online like \u003ca href=\"http://writingjudge.com/\"\u003eWritingJudge\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://grammarly.com\"\u003eGrammarly\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.trustmypaper.com/\"\u003eTrustMyPaper\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://bestessay.education/\"\u003eBestEssay.Education\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://hemingwayapp.com\"\u003eHemingway\u003c/a\u003e that can help you calibrate the tone and voice of your copy to the needs of your target audience. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCommunicating the style to the web designer will also help them build a background that complements the content written on your website. Style can also refer to the layout itself. Think about elements that you like from outside inspiration and try to have those things incorporated into the website design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eScandinavian design, for example, focuses on simplicity, minimalism, and functionally. Its use of sharp lines and a neutral palette gives a clean look to any home, and if these same concepts are applied to the web design process, it creates a sleek and elegant looking site.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eExamples of Websites and Why They’re Designed Well\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe are going to focus on two different websites, and what each one did well. There’s the social media titan, Facebook, and the sports website, ESPN.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn excellent example of the concept of the use of designing websites with complementary color schemes to their logo is Facebook. Facebook’s logo has a white letter on a blue background. The pane at the top of the page is blue. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the interface seems cluttered, however, upon closer inspection, the design team did an excellent job of incorporating white space to break up various sections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.espn.com/\"\u003eESPN’s website\u003c/a\u003e also has a lot going on, but everything works well together. You have articles you can read and scores you can check, but there’s also background videos playing to keep you informed on a variety of topics.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis site also makes use of smooth transitions, keeping the UI clean. Above the navigation ribbon are scores from a variety of sports, along with a plugin for a variety of fantasy sports leagues. This makes ESPN’s site a one-stop-shop for anything sports-related.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eCommunicating Deadlines \u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eOut of all of the sections in this article, deadlines may be the \u003ca href=\"https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/want-to-show-great-leadership-skills-as-deadline-approaches-try-these-5-communic.html\"\u003ehardest to communicate\u003c/a\u003e. Life happens, and the web designer may be attempting to juggle multiple projects. Because of this, deadlines may not be met. Rather than say the project is due a month from now, say you would like to see progress checks every Thursday.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis allows you to see the site as it evolves. By breaking it up into smaller tasks, you can address something you don’t like right during the check-ins, rather than the designer have to tweak their final product.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t be afraid to contact the web designer. It’s better to reach out a week before the deadline and find out that the site will be completed late, rather than learning this the day after the due date.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Budget\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere should be two parts of the budget: the cost of the website, and the fee associated with reimbursing the designer for their time. As a general rule, the more detailed a website is, the more you’ll pay for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“The more experience someone brings to designing a project, the more their services will cost, but that’s because they\u0026#39;ll be able to deliver a better product.” — Diana Adjadj, freelance UX writer at \u003ca href=\"https://studicus.com/\"\u003eStudicus\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eFinal Thoughts on Web Design Briefs\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eWriting a brief is a time-consuming process, but a necessary one. When you clearly communicate your ideas and goals with the designer, you not only give them an idea of what they’re supposed to build, but you also gain an unbiased sounding board.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis becomes useful when you are talking through what you want to accomplish, and they’re able to give feedback or ask questions that you may have missed. As long as the designer stays on brief and budget, you’re sure to have a website that doesn’t just meet your needs, but exceeds them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eABOUT THE AUTHOR\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eKristin Savage is an English Literature graduate who is interested in writing and planning to publish her own book in the near future. She graduated last year but is already a true expert when it comes to presenting a text in a creative and understandable manner, this is why she’s a senior editor at \u003ca href=\"https://www.grabmyessay.com/buy-research-paper\"\u003eGrab My Essay\u003c/a\u003e, and a regular contributor at \u003ca href=\"https://wowgrade.net/\"\u003eWoWGrade\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://supremedissertations.com/\"\u003eSupreme Dissertations\u003c/a\u003e.

Though a lot of them were interested, they either couldn’t afford it or just didn’t see the value. Having seen it firsthand, I knew I would be able to deliver in excess of the $10k they would need to pay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile waiting for the right client, Jose and I ran a CORE workshop. I focused on user profiles, and Jose handled the brand attributes and the goals/prioritization exercises. Jose had remarked that for someone new to this, I was really good at doing CORE and teaching. Turns out, my 15 years teaching design students and dealing with commercial clients was more than enough “training” and preparation to be a facilitator.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEventually, I found a client. And, I changed the discovery price from $10k to $30k. How did I get to that number? If I hadn’t been able to sell it for $10k, why did I increase the price by 3x?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eIf you want better clients, you have to charge more.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe project was a little daunting as the C-suite executives flew from the east coast for a 2-day session just to work with us. I had hired Jose to help me facilitate the session as a safety net. At the end of day one, I had everyone from the CEO, CRO, CMO and CTO giving me hugs. They all felt a sense of validation. Their needs were heard by their respective team. I also helped them “discover” why they weren’t gaining traction with their customers. This was worth the entire price of admission.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe engagement started at $100k and blew up to over $250k as the scope grew. Again, you might be in disbelief that someone who had never sold strategy, let alone do it, was able to sell an engagement of this size.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs we moved into creating deliverables for the client, Jose and I ran our second CORE workshop at our office.

It has components that help you define the brand and write a positioning statement. If done properly, it can produce actionable insights, and at the least, give you (the creative) an opportunity to be more than an “order taker” to the key decision-makers. Like many things, it’s a tool. The tool is a reflection of the person who uses it. Nothing more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul role=\"list\"\u003e\u003cli\u003eCORE is an open framework\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt’s encouraged that you adapt it for your specific needs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt’s not a shortcut\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIt’s not magic, but the results can be magical\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere are some outdated examples that are included (but do not materially affect how you use it)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThere are some errors, omissions and typos (again, should not impact you on any real level)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eJose is the author.

Upon discovering a well of great videos on YouTube, I decided that I could probably make own.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Deconstruct, Analyze, \u0026amp; Understand:\u003c/strong\u003e In my research, I found dozens of examples that inspired me. I took the chill vibes and practical information of \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/RsFGoETBNy4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDavid Zhang’s videos\u003c/a\u003e. I looked to the amazing storytelling and cinematography of \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/LAtHvlPViJo\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMatt D’Vella\u003c/a\u003e, and formed a script similar to his writing style.

I took all the best qualities that I liked from my research and applied them to my work. I also took into consideration all of the keywords and tags used to describe all of the popular videos in this space.

Let’s not forget all of the various tools, plugins, and software options out there to choose from to build websites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLuckily, there’s an awesome tool out there that helps you easily design impressive, responsive websites, even if you don’t know how to code: Webflow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe first picked up Webflow to build the Hamilton Family Brewery’s site from our \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/LZtM7wyqe7w\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBuilding a Brand series\u003c/a\u003e.

We’re much more used to design programs like Photoshop and Illustrator, so we were pleasantly surprised to see how much Webflow looked and functioned like our favorite programs.

Let’s not forget all of the various tools, plugins, and software options out there to choose from to build websites.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLuckily, there’s an awesome tool out there that helps you easily design impressive, responsive websites, even if you don’t know how to code: Webflow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe first picked up Webflow to build the Hamilton Family Brewery’s site from our \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/LZtM7wyqe7w\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBuilding a Brand series\u003c/a\u003e.

Defining Your Customer Persona\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eI tell this to not only my employees, but also to my clients. It is important that you KNOW WHO YOUR AUDIENCE IS. You are not going to target everyone, and you are not going to take over everyone’s work. You need to first focus on a specific persona to start your lead generation. For example, if you are involved in health \u0026amp; fitness a lot, try to focus on clients in this realm. All leads and customers aren’t created equal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 80/20 principle tells that 80% of revenue is generated by 20% of customers. If we apply it once more, we’ll see that 4% of customers generate 64% of revenue. The real problem here is that most companies never give this 4% of customers and leads the time they deserve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn customer profile helps you to collect the data from your customers from the specific market segment and to focus your inbound strategy on them, instead of prospecting everybody who might buy from you. This takes your Linkedin content from: “5 key lessons I learned about Fintech startups” to “5 key lessons I learned from running a fast growing Fintech start-up as a CEO” Knowing this, building your content strategy is a piece of cake.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you are still deciding on your Ideal Customer Profile, start here:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWant to get a free 15-page worksheet that helps you define your persona for you?

Defining Your Market Segment\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eDifferent market segments who will potentially buy your product have different challenges, goals and, accordingly, seek completely different content. A senior marketer or head of growth from an enterprise SaaS might be looking for website creatives while a business owner will be looking for print designs for a conference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe segment you define will allow you to better present your portfolio and be more effective in gaining client interest in the first place. Even if you try to create universal content that will fit both market segments, you’ll face another problem – relevant examples.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere is another rule of thumb:\u003cbr/\u003eRelevant content = relevant examples.\u003cbr/\u003eWhen the head of marketing for ClassPass (net monthly revenue of $2M) sees examples that are related to an early-stage startup or print graphic, she’ll subconsciously mark the content as irrelevant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eS\u003cstrong\u003etep 3.

You are not going to target everyone, and you are not going to take over everyone’s work. You need to first focus on a specific persona to start your lead generation. For example, if you are involved in health \u0026amp; fitness a lot, try to focus on clients in this realm. All leads and customers aren’t created equal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe 80/20 principle tells that 80% of revenue is generated by 20% of customers. If we apply it once more, we’ll see that 4% of customers generate 64% of revenue. The real problem here is that most companies never give this 4% of customers and leads the time they deserve.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn customer profile helps you to collect the data from your customers from the specific market segment and to focus your inbound strategy on them, instead of prospecting everybody who might buy from you.

That is a great start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom there, slowly iterate your pitch and work your way up to 10%.

I was drawn to the simplicity, typography, colors and distinctive graphics. Meanwhile, I had spoken to some amazing guests on The Futur and they all seemed to echo the same message—work on personal projects. This was vital to being an artist. We heard \u003ca href=\"https://gmunk.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGMUNK\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://elizabethcareysmith.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eElizabeth Carey Smith\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://shop.baugasm.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBaugasm\u003c/a\u003e all say essentially the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I was searching for something that I could do on a daily basis—tight parameters, easy and fun to do, didn’t require special equipment or space to produce—it came to me. Eureka! Go back to the start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou see, my love for design didn’t begin with the works of Paul Rand, Herb Lubalin, Lou Dorfsman or Bradbury Thompson. It began with skateboarding. Yes, skateboarding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile many “serious” skateboarders picked decks based on their affinity towards a particular skate brand, professional rider, or board shape, I mostly picked boards based on the visual appeal. As a kid growing up in the 80s, I was drawn towards brands like Santa Cruz skateboards, especially the illustration work of Jim Phillips: The screaming hand, Rob Roskopp melting face, Jeff Kendal snake bite, Jason Jesse Neptune \u0026amp; Sun God, and Corey O’Brien’s Grim Reaper. Then there was Vision’s Psycho Stick, Gator’s mesmerizing Op-Art spiral and the instant classic Mark Gonzalez deck. This list wouldn’t be complete without mentioning skateboarding giant Powell Peralta. My favorite was Steve Caballero’s Dragon, Mike Vallely elephant, Tony Hawk skull hawk, and Mike McGill’s skull/snake. Other notable mentions: Christian Hosoi hammerhead, Chris Miller man/dog, and SMA’s Natas Kaupas design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938dd8fdbce42_Typography-swiss-deck-01-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eWolfgang Weingart\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938d134dbce43_Typography-swiss-deck-03-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eJosef Müller Brockmann\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269382ec1dbce46_Typography-swiss-deck-05-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381c69dbce47_Skateboard-deck-01-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381488dbce45_Skateboard-deck-02-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938b552dbce44_Skateboard-deck-03-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo test the idea, I bought a skateboard mock-up template from Creative Market.

Then, I quickly threw some images on them (Olly Moss and Wolfgang Weingart) to see how I felt. They were awesome! Okay, they were awesome before throwing on a skateboard deck, but what it proved to me was the unique size and shape of skate decks, made for interesting compositional problems to solve. It also showed that sophisticated designs and illustrations have been a part of skate culture, but this was an opportunity to take it to the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI then enrolled the Futur Pro Community to participate in the challenge with me. Produce a design a day for at least 30 days. Once completed, we could assemble a nice book and share with friends. If they turned out really well, we could actually print a few up and give them as gifts, sell as merch, or take them on the road for a traveling exhibit of design and street culture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eIf you’d like to participate, here’s what you need to do:\u003c/h5\u003e\u003col role=\"list\"\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase the \u003ca href=\"https://creativemarket.com/iconisusmockup/3852002-Skateboard-Mockup-Template?u=chrisdo\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCreative Market Template\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eResize to a square format.

I was drawn to the simplicity, typography, colors and distinctive graphics. Meanwhile, I had spoken to some amazing guests on The Futur and they all seemed to echo the same message—work on personal projects. This was vital to being an artist. We heard \u003ca href=\"https://gmunk.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGMUNK\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://elizabethcareysmith.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eElizabeth Carey Smith\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://shop.baugasm.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBaugasm\u003c/a\u003e all say essentially the same thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I was searching for something that I could do on a daily basis—tight parameters, easy and fun to do, didn’t require special equipment or space to produce—it came to me. Eureka! Go back to the start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou see, my love for design didn’t begin with the works of Paul Rand, Herb Lubalin, Lou Dorfsman or Bradbury Thompson. It began with skateboarding. Yes, skateboarding.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile many “serious” skateboarders picked decks based on their affinity towards a particular skate brand, professional rider, or board shape, I mostly picked boards based on the visual appeal. As a kid growing up in the 80s, I was drawn towards brands like Santa Cruz skateboards, especially the illustration work of Jim Phillips: The screaming hand, Rob Roskopp melting face, Jeff Kendal snake bite, Jason Jesse Neptune \u0026amp; Sun God, and Corey O’Brien’s Grim Reaper. Then there was Vision’s Psycho Stick, Gator’s mesmerizing Op-Art spiral and the instant classic Mark Gonzalez deck. This list wouldn’t be complete without mentioning skateboarding giant Powell Peralta. My favorite was Steve Caballero’s Dragon, Mike Vallely elephant, Tony Hawk skull hawk, and Mike McGill’s skull/snake. Other notable mentions: Christian Hosoi hammerhead, Chris Miller man/dog, and SMA’s Natas Kaupas design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938dd8fdbce42_Typography-swiss-deck-01-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eWolfgang Weingart\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938d134dbce43_Typography-swiss-deck-03-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eJosef Müller Brockmann\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269382ec1dbce46_Typography-swiss-deck-05-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381c69dbce47_Skateboard-deck-01-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381488dbce45_Skateboard-deck-02-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938b552dbce44_Skateboard-deck-03-300x300.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo test the idea, I bought a skateboard mock-up template from Creative Market.

Then, I quickly threw some images on them (Olly Moss and Wolfgang Weingart) to see how I felt. They were awesome! Okay, they were awesome before throwing on a skateboard deck, but what it proved to me was the unique size and shape of skate decks, made for interesting compositional problems to solve. It also showed that sophisticated designs and illustrations have been a part of skate culture, but this was an opportunity to take it to the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI then enrolled the Futur Pro Community to participate in the challenge with me. Produce a design a day for at least 30 days. Once completed, we could assemble a nice book and share with friends. If they turned out really well, we could actually print a few up and give them as gifts, sell as merch, or take them on the road for a traveling exhibit of design and street culture.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eIf you’d like to participate, here’s what you need to do:\u003c/h5\u003e\u003col role=\"list\"\u003e\u003cli\u003ePurchase the \u003ca href=\"https://creativemarket.com/iconisusmockup/3852002-Skateboard-Mockup-Template?u=chrisdo\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCreative Market Template\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eResize to a square format.

I may not have did the best job at making the design feel special and premium, but I tried to tackle the problem by highlighting big beautiful signage, high quality printing effects and materials, as well as carefully crafted mockups.

Because Lufthansa is a German airline with a German name, finding something that would work in both German and English was definitely a challenge. My solution was the name “Nest”, which is a word that works in both English and German. Everything beyond that just fell in to place, the brand atmosphere, the colors, typography. The other big problem was in weighing the differences between this VIP class and the larger airline brand. The goal was to create something distinct and uniquely better, but something that didn’t deviate too far from the brand. The ultimate product was something that I believe to be an elegant and minimalist solution to accompany an already powerful, established brand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269387797dbcf1d_Wordmark-Icon.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe final Logomark.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eClosing Thoughts\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eYoung Guns has given me not only the practical and tangible skills needed in my career, but also the general mindset and approach I need to have going forward in my career.

I may not have did the best job at making the design feel special and premium, but I tried to tackle the problem by highlighting big beautiful signage, high quality printing effects and materials, as well as carefully crafted mockups.

I based the whole thing around having the sense of peace and not having to worry about anything while traveling “Serenity class”.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693854c7dbceff_arun-img3.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eBoarding pass with no ads on the back side to give a stress-free feeling.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269383266dbcf06_arun-img4.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThis envelope comes as a part of welcome vanity kit\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eChallenges\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eComing up with the name of the VIP class was the most difficult task, I spent a considerable amount of time on just that.

Because Lufthansa is a German airline with a German name, finding something that would work in both German and English was definitely a challenge. My solution was the name “Nest”, which is a word that works in both English and German. Everything beyond that just fell in to place, the brand atmosphere, the colors, typography. The other big problem was in weighing the differences between this VIP class and the larger airline brand. The goal was to create something distinct and uniquely better, but something that didn’t deviate too far from the brand. The ultimate product was something that I believe to be an elegant and minimalist solution to accompany an already powerful, established brand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269387797dbcf1d_Wordmark-Icon.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eThe final Logomark.\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eClosing Thoughts\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eYoung Guns has given me not only the practical and tangible skills needed in my career, but also the general mindset and approach I need to have going forward in my career.

I don’t know if you’ve ever used UpWork to hire someone, but let me assure you: it sucks. I posted a job looking for a copywriter once and had over 1,000 applicants. OVER ONE THOUSAND. I was amazed that many of them had no experience, no portfolio, and could barely stitch a sentence together. These applicants had made it through Upworks vigorous ‘data science’ and landed straight into my inbox.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSfebOXSBOE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMind bottling\u003c/a\u003e, isn’t it? Just when you have faith in the system that good work will get its chance if you do your best, you’re not even considered for the first hurdle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo we’ve established that Upwork is no place for professionals like you…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you find bigger clients outside of Upwork?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eWell, it’s tough. At least to start – don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. But there’s faith. Finding bigger clients is absolutely doable with some hard work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt helps to learn a little about consumer psychology here. Your Upwork client probably was drawn to that platform for one of a few reasons, such as they have no idea where else to look for service providers. They could scour the internet for hours searching for good freelancers, or they could simply log on to Upwork and check out their extensive list all in one place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlternatively, they may want to find a deal, or can’t afford industry-accepted rates for professional design. Most people, including clients, want to feel as though they’re getting good deals worth for their budget without doing bad business. Which brings us into our last reason. They might be worried about scams or getting screwed over. There’s a certain level of safety in doing your business through a third-party.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you ask me, they’re all pretty awful ways to start a professional relationship. So let’s take a look at some of the reasons why bigger clients choose the designers they work with…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey might have previously worked with the designer, or know someone who has worked with them in the past. Perhaps they met the designer in person or discovered them via social media due to their large following. Or maybe they looked at the designer’s portfolio, appreciated their work and envisioned their style successfully pulling off the work that they want doing for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis list is by no means complete, but you can start to see the difference. Most of these are based around trust. Trust in the designer showing up for work, fulfilling their duties and doing so in a way that merges with the client. The underlying cause for the purchase decision is the same, but their results and actions vary wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what’s the one takeaway here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBigger clients buy assurance, and they don’t look for it on sites like Upwork.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eAssurance is everything to a high-paying client. Assurance is the key to find bigger clients and land bigger jobs. What does that mean? Bigger design clients are looking for you to be able to assure them that you’ll hit three major points when you get the job done; they need to know you can complete it to their standard, on time and in budget. When you put your name forward to apply for a job, communicating that you can match these three criteria is key.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy now we’re sure your targets are set on landing bigger clients, so let’s take a look at a simple four-step process to get on their radar and connect with them. Note — we could probably write an encyclopedia on each of these steps, but for the purpose of this article, let’s take a macro view of this flow:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Define who you want to work with\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis step is key, and not many people do it well. It’s hard to pinpoint your ideal client when you feel as though any well-paying work would suffice. Take the time to tap into what really interests you, what your passions are and your beliefs. Don’t underestimate how much enjoying the work and connecting with it on a personal level of interest can influence the final outcome. If you’re still stuck for ideas you could look at your hobbies and see how they could influence the clients you approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor instance, let’s say you’re a craft beer enthusiast — what would stop you from working with a local brewery? Plot out an entire list of breweries, bars, and burger joints in your area. Then learn a little about the corporate leadership and company structure. Who’s responsible for the brand image? Who’s responsible for purchasing media or marketing materials?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve done that, figure out all the ways you can make these people aware that you exist. Look up examples of a consumer journey and use a combination of your knowledge and common sense to plot out a journey for each type of business that you want to work with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e2. Get positioned\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the second step for a reason. You should mirror who your desired customers are and what they need. Tesla may be a great car, but they’d have a tough time selling to someone shopping for an ATV.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou need to decide who your target client is before positioning yourself because otherwise, you’ll cast a wider net in hopes of trying to please everyone. If you’re positioning yourself as a freelancer, I highly recommend developing a very niche style and service offering. In other words, don’t have a website that offers or displays web design, character design, illustration, print work, and kinetic typography in one place. Someone who is looking for an expert will see this and run far, far away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHave you ever been stood in a grocery store looking for something simple and been bombarded with choice? Sometimes offering a selective number of things, and proving you’re great at every single one, outshines saying you’re capable of doing twenty things – and this is one of those times. If you’re positioning yourself as an agency, or as a “we,” you have a little more leeway, but definitely stick to a defined group of services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou want a client to come onto your website and see a little of what they’re about. Does your website reflect your vertical? Does it reflect WHO you want to work with? This is where you sell assurance. If they can see a similar color-palette as their own or a similar style of work that they’re used to, then they will feel more comfortable trusting you to produce their vision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re not sure where to start with this, consider these three questions first:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you have great examples of only your best work?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoes your website have grammatical errors? (Always a big no-no)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you have references and testimonials available and visible?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Be visible\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin your customer journey, you should have identified several opportunities to increase your business’ awareness. Now is the time to take action on these items. Gaining visibility will differ from business to business, but your main focus should be on social media, branding, and SEO.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCrafting a specialized Instagram account, actually GOING to those burger joints and breweries and talking to the staff, connecting with leadership over LinkedIn (without overselling, people, c’mon), being active in local small business groups, or competing in award shows are all good ways to increase awareness for your practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTraction is a great book to read for awareness ideas — they claim there are 19 channels for lead generation. \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591848369/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;camp=1789\u0026amp;creative=9325\u0026amp;creativeASIN=1591848369\u0026amp;linkCode=as2\u0026amp;tag=mrbenburns0a-20\u0026amp;linkId=b99f333ce7f0e27062d26a0bc44898f4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck it out here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Connect\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter you’ve run your passive awareness efforts, it’s time for some hand-to-hand combat. Pick five of the people you listed in the first step and buckle your seatbelt. I’m going to suggest something that will go against every one of your designerly instincts:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eInvite them to lunch.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOr coffee. Or for a beer. Just invite them out to connect. No strings attached, no sales pitch. Just say you’re new in town/in business/to their shop, and that you’d LOVE to pick their brains for some knowledge. It’s as simple as that. You can shoot them a three line email, or send them a tweet, or even stop by their business and invite them in person. However, you do it, be cordial, friendly, and reassure them that you’re not there to sell them. People hate that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis really is part of the awareness phase, and it’s almost like a cold call, but if you have no agenda, it takes the pressure off of both of you. When you sit down with them, just ask questions. How did they get their logo done? Who do they work with for packaging? What’s the worst part of their job? Show genuine interest and it will be reciprocated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, you may not get work right off the bat. But if you continue to sit down with people, your name will start to pop up in industry conversations. You’ll be amazed when that first massive design job lands at your feet how far that one connection went.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf casually meeting a prospective client doesn’t come naturally to you – and don’t worry, it doesn’t to many of us – then fear not. We’ve released the \u003ca href=\"https://thefutur.com/resources/first-meeting-workbook\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFirst Meeting Worksheet\u003c/a\u003e which is absolutely free and all it requires is for you to fill in the blanks.

Finding high-paying design clients, as in any other sale, is all about people. Brainstorm and follow a customer/consumer journey, and make every effort to genuinely connect with other humans who are positioned to help you grow. It’s even better if you can offer them value immediately, even if it is simply in the form of stimulating conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlready have a meeting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, congrats!

So let’s take a look at some of the reasons why bigger clients choose the designers they work with…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey might have previously worked with the designer, or know someone who has worked with them in the past. Perhaps they met the designer in person or discovered them via social media due to their large following. Or maybe they looked at the designer’s portfolio, appreciated their work and envisioned their style successfully pulling off the work that they want doing for themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis list is by no means complete, but you can start to see the difference. Most of these are based around trust. Trust in the designer showing up for work, fulfilling their duties and doing so in a way that merges with the client. The underlying cause for the purchase decision is the same, but their results and actions vary wildly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo what’s the one takeaway here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBigger clients buy assurance, and they don’t look for it on sites like Upwork.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eAssurance is everything to a high-paying client. Assurance is the key to find bigger clients and land bigger jobs. What does that mean? Bigger design clients are looking for you to be able to assure them that you’ll hit three major points when you get the job done; they need to know you can complete it to their standard, on time and in budget. When you put your name forward to apply for a job, communicating that you can match these three criteria is key.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy now we’re sure your targets are set on landing bigger clients, so let’s take a look at a simple four-step process to get on their radar and connect with them. Note — we could probably write an encyclopedia on each of these steps, but for the purpose of this article, let’s take a macro view of this flow:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. Define who you want to work with\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis step is key, and not many people do it well. It’s hard to pinpoint your ideal client when you feel as though any well-paying work would suffice. Take the time to tap into what really interests you, what your passions are and your beliefs. Don’t underestimate how much enjoying the work and connecting with it on a personal level of interest can influence the final outcome. If you’re still stuck for ideas you could look at your hobbies and see how they could influence the clients you approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor instance, let’s say you’re a craft beer enthusiast — what would stop you from working with a local brewery? Plot out an entire list of breweries, bars, and burger joints in your area. Then learn a little about the corporate leadership and company structure. Who’s responsible for the brand image? Who’s responsible for purchasing media or marketing materials?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce you’ve done that, figure out all the ways you can make these people aware that you exist. Look up examples of a consumer journey and use a combination of your knowledge and common sense to plot out a journey for each type of business that you want to work with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e2. Get positioned\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the second step for a reason. You should mirror who your desired customers are and what they need. Tesla may be a great car, but they’d have a tough time selling to someone shopping for an ATV.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou need to decide who your target client is before positioning yourself because otherwise, you’ll cast a wider net in hopes of trying to please everyone. If you’re positioning yourself as a freelancer, I highly recommend developing a very niche style and service offering. In other words, don’t have a website that offers or displays web design, character design, illustration, print work, and kinetic typography in one place. Someone who is looking for an expert will see this and run far, far away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHave you ever been stood in a grocery store looking for something simple and been bombarded with choice? Sometimes offering a selective number of things, and proving you’re great at every single one, outshines saying you’re capable of doing twenty things – and this is one of those times. If you’re positioning yourself as an agency, or as a “we,” you have a little more leeway, but definitely stick to a defined group of services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou want a client to come onto your website and see a little of what they’re about. Does your website reflect your vertical? Does it reflect WHO you want to work with? This is where you sell assurance. If they can see a similar color-palette as their own or a similar style of work that they’re used to, then they will feel more comfortable trusting you to produce their vision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re not sure where to start with this, consider these three questions first:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you have great examples of only your best work?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDoes your website have grammatical errors? (Always a big no-no)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you have references and testimonials available and visible?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Be visible\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin your customer journey, you should have identified several opportunities to increase your business’ awareness. Now is the time to take action on these items. Gaining visibility will differ from business to business, but your main focus should be on social media, branding, and SEO.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCrafting a specialized Instagram account, actually GOING to those burger joints and breweries and talking to the staff, connecting with leadership over LinkedIn (without overselling, people, c’mon), being active in local small business groups, or competing in award shows are all good ways to increase awareness for your practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTraction is a great book to read for awareness ideas — they claim there are 19 channels for lead generation. \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591848369/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;camp=1789\u0026amp;creative=9325\u0026amp;creativeASIN=1591848369\u0026amp;linkCode=as2\u0026amp;tag=mrbenburns0a-20\u0026amp;linkId=b99f333ce7f0e27062d26a0bc44898f4\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck it out here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Connect\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter you’ve run your passive awareness efforts, it’s time for some hand-to-hand combat. Pick five of the people you listed in the first step and buckle your seatbelt. I’m going to suggest something that will go against every one of your designerly instincts:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eInvite them to lunch.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOr coffee. Or for a beer. Just invite them out to connect. No strings attached, no sales pitch. Just say you’re new in town/in business/to their shop, and that you’d LOVE to pick their brains for some knowledge. It’s as simple as that. You can shoot them a three line email, or send them a tweet, or even stop by their business and invite them in person. However, you do it, be cordial, friendly, and reassure them that you’re not there to sell them. People hate that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis really is part of the awareness phase, and it’s almost like a cold call, but if you have no agenda, it takes the pressure off of both of you. When you sit down with them, just ask questions. How did they get their logo done? Who do they work with for packaging? What’s the worst part of their job? Show genuine interest and it will be reciprocated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, you may not get work right off the bat. But if you continue to sit down with people, your name will start to pop up in industry conversations. You’ll be amazed when that first massive design job lands at your feet how far that one connection went.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf casually meeting a prospective client doesn’t come naturally to you – and don’t worry, it doesn’t to many of us – then fear not.

Finding high-paying design clients, as in any other sale, is all about people. Brainstorm and follow a customer/consumer journey, and make every effort to genuinely connect with other humans who are positioned to help you grow. It’s even better if you can offer them value immediately, even if it is simply in the form of stimulating conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlready have a meeting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst of all, congrats!

Talk about money early\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003e“You have to say a price before you show a price.” As our good friend, Blair Enns would say. Don’t beat around the bush. By not talking about money, you are failing to answer the #1 question on both of your minds. Don’t delay the budget conversation by kicking it down the road. It’s important to have this conversation up front. (And no, it’s not rude or impolite to talk about money in the first meeting.) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are some examples of how you can use price anchoring and price bracketing to have the money conversation early on with clients:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/87CPZdh6FIc\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DjgVwN_k_88\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e2.

People will remember how you made them feel long after they forget your words. People like others who are like themselves. So if you modulate your energy level to match the other person, you can easily build rapport.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTony Robbins calls this “Match \u0026amp; Mirror.” If the other person speaks loudly and quickly, you should speak loudly and quickly. In this short video, Tony describes how you can build rapport with any kind of person:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9uHBEGpJm4\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e3. Show. Don\u0026#39;t tell.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost people incorrectly “educate” the client by describing and selling. They talk clients’ ears off about their services, and why they’re the right person for the job. Stop trying to “educate” your prospects. “Educe” is the root word of “educate,” and it means to draw out, not put in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRather than describing your services, you need to demonstrate your value. You do that by asking good questions, listening intently, and surfacing insights that weren’t apparent to them, prior to meeting you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo how might you do this? In this video Chris demonstrates how to show, not tell:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cuy994Fs64\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e4. Ask more questions.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhoever asks more questions is in control of the conversation. The quality of the questions you ask, determine your value. As we saw in the video above, by asking more questions, you help the prospect realize their own challenges and solutions. It’s a Socratic approach– allowing the other person to come to their own conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou aren’t selling anymore. Rather, in this process, you are able to demonstrate your value as an expert consultant to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo in your next meeting, ask directed but open-ended questions that allow the other person to reveal insights on what would be helpful to them. These are much better than simple yes or no questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e5. Build trust.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn sales, the objective is to provide the client with information to help them make the best decision for them. You must remain neutral and unbiased. A fiduciary with their best interests in mind. Your goal is just to be helpful to them. This might mean that you aren’t the right person for the job. So you must be willing to walk away from the opportunity. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know this might be odd to hear, but by doing this, you accomplish 2 very important things:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.

You are now in the position to say “no.” This gives you a lot of power in this client-vendor dynamic. You will not look desperate, because you don’t need this job.

Talk about money early\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003e“You have to say a price before you show a price.” As our good friend, Blair Enns would say. Don’t beat around the bush. By not talking about money, you are failing to answer the #1 question on both of your minds. Don’t delay the budget conversation by kicking it down the road. It’s important to have this conversation up front. (And no, it’s not rude or impolite to talk about money in the first meeting.) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are some examples of how you can use price anchoring and price bracketing to have the money conversation early on with clients:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/87CPZdh6FIc\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DjgVwN_k_88\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e2. S\u003cstrong\u003etyle is more important than substance.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s not just what you say, it’s how you say it. People will remember how you made them feel long after they forget your words. People like others who are like themselves. So if you modulate your energy level to match the other person, you can easily build rapport.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTony Robbins calls this “Match \u0026amp; Mirror.” If the other person speaks loudly and quickly, you should speak loudly and quickly. In this short video, Tony describes how you can build rapport with any kind of person:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9uHBEGpJm4\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e3. Show. Don\u0026#39;t tell.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost people incorrectly “educate” the client by describing and selling. They talk clients’ ears off about their services, and why they’re the right person for the job. Stop trying to “educate” your prospects. “Educe” is the root word of “educate,” and it means to draw out, not put in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eRather than describing your services, you need to demonstrate your value. You do that by asking good questions, listening intently, and surfacing insights that weren’t apparent to them, prior to meeting you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo how might you do this? In this video Chris demonstrates how to show, not tell:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"true\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cuy994Fs64\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e4. Ask more questions.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhoever asks more questions is in control of the conversation. The quality of the questions you ask, determine your value. As we saw in the video above, by asking more questions, you help the prospect realize their own challenges and solutions. It’s a Socratic approach– allowing the other person to come to their own conclusion.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou aren’t selling anymore. Rather, in this process, you are able to demonstrate your value as an expert consultant to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo in your next meeting, ask directed but open-ended questions that allow the other person to reveal insights on what would be helpful to them. These are much better than simple yes or no questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e5. Build trust.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn sales, the objective is to provide the client with information to help them make the best decision for them. You must remain neutral and unbiased. A fiduciary with their best interests in mind. Your goal is just to be helpful to them. This might mean that you aren’t the right person for the job. So you must be willing to walk away from the opportunity. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know this might be odd to hear, but by doing this, you accomplish 2 very important things:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. The prospect now knows that you aren’t trying to force them to buy your product or service. You earn their trust.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2. You are now in the position to say “no.” This gives you a lot of power in this client-vendor dynamic. You will not look desperate, because you don’t need this job. Pressure is taken off of the situation because neither of you has to make a potentially regretful choice then and there.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext time you enter a sales meeting, just focus on being helpful to them.

As a child, he was adopted and lost his mother to cancer. He was adopted again, by his grandfather a master plumber who taught him hard work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSadly, Joey’s grandfather passed away when he was 17 and the moment he became a legal adult, he was kicked out of his home by his step-grandmother. Embarrassed and reluctant to ask for help, Joey spent a couple weeks sleeping in his car before his cousin noticed and took him in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese real-life experiences from his youth have led Joey to make big moves in his life, like giving up his fruitful freelance design career to start an unproven notebook company with his friend from college. Where others would consider such a thing too risky, Joey says, “If that’s the only thing that’s stopping me… then it’s not a fear I should give into.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJoey’s risk paid off and he will continue to take big risks in the future.

You can demonstrate the value of thinking by talking and listening.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKIyObgkBVI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMelinda Livsey\u003cbr/\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.marksandmaker.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMarks and Maker\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e— [Transcription] —\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003e@0:36\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[Chris Do]: So now, we’re going to set some new benchmarks, and I’m going to give her some new tools. Sharpen those “P-shing!” Alright. Let’s do it! Let’s get into it. Alright. Fire away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Melinda Livsey]: You had mentioned in the last episode that I could have that whole conversation without visuals and I would like to hear how.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@0:55\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Okay. So here’s the cool part: once you get into the thinking stage where you can charge for it, well thinking doesn’t have to have the traditional forms that making does. So making requires mock-ups, beautiful photography, great presentations. But thinking, you can demonstrate the value of thinking just by talking and listening. That you can do. So, we’re gonna do this where I’m gonna show you how to have this whole conversation without any visuals and feel fully confident without a website, without anything, you can do this. All you have to do is tell better stories. And, make analogies. Find metaphors. So this is where I may or may not have told you to do this already, but you kinda have to read some case studies so that you’re ready to talk about a lot of different things. Wherever the conversation goes, so this is where Bruce Lee says, “Be like water.” You wanna be like water. So I’m just controlling and directing energy so that when they push, I pull, and when they pull, I push, and so I’m always there when I’m not there–that kind of thing. This is getting into the whole zen of it. The first call typically is like, “Are they even qualified to be talking to me?” And that’s the right attitude to have. Are they qualified in the sense of, “Can they afford me? Do I align with their goals? Am I vibing with them? Is what they want realistic?” Because you can do it all, but if you need it done in two days, I’m not the right person for you. And that’s totally okay. And we’re doing it without judgement. Okay? So this is kind of like, we’re going to enter into this stage where, give me this set-up, and you and I will play. How can we do this so that you feel like this is close to your experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@2:41\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Well, being that this conversation is not close to my experience, it would be just someone calling me–are we talking about, is this the qualifying call? What call is this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Any call you want. Any call where you’re going to have to explain to them what you do without visuals. Almost all of the business that I do is without visuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Um, let’s just say it is someone who wants…it’s a start-up (because I do have a lot of start-ups contacting me) that wants to come out with an app.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Anything else?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@3:15\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: And, they want a website, and they want branding. And let’s just say they have the framework of their app done by a developer. So now they realize, “Oh! It doesn’t look good.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right. They’ve done the UX part, but they haven’t done the UI part. Okay. Alright, so, do we begin the conversation at the beginning? Is this our second call–you let me know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uhhh, I would, in my–in the way I do it, it would be the second call after I have qualified them with, let’s say, the timeline and price, and goals. Like, the overarching goal. Do we vibe? So this would be the one, let’s say the “sales” one, like, to close the lead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh. That’s very interesting. Usually I do all the closing at the first call.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay, then let’s make it that call!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Can we do it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah! ‘Cause I’m learning here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So, this’ll be call “one and a half.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@4:05\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Basically you’re gonna take the second call and you’re going to smash it into their first call. So what we’re looking for are kinds of micro-engagements, like microtransactions to gain trust and to build trust. So when we’re talking to them, I’m very deliberate and intentional in terms of the words that I choose and how I describe what it is that we do. Because that’s your best opportunity to establish who you are and what you’re gonna do for your client. So go ahead: Set it up! We’re gonna talk. The phone rings. You call me or I call you? You call me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I call you because…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right. That’s how it works. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: You’re gonna teach me this, right? [Laughter.]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@4:44\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Hey, Chris. I saw your work. I have an app and I already have the framework done and I got the UX done, but I need a website. It looks horrible, so I need branding, and…I’d love to work with you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Great! Fantastic! First of all, thank you for calling. Before I dive into all the deliverables and things of that nature, I’m curious what you saw or why you decided to reach out to me in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Um, I reached out to you because our mutual friend referred me to you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh. Kelly?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah! Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Love Kelly! I’m gonna have to send her a little thank you note.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Alright, that’s great! Yeah!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Mutual friend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: She told me that I should talk to you because I was telling her about where we’re at and that I was looking for someone, and then your name came up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@5:25\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Okay. Perfect. So I just want to let you know (And we’re having this just as a verbal conversation, alright? So I’m not even gonna look at Melinda. It’s just, it’s a telephone conversation.) I just wanna let you know that a lot of clients come to me and ask me to do things and I’m thrilled to do them. The thing is, I’m successful at doing these things because I have a framework that I use and if you’re open to this, [then] I would like to describe it a little bit to you, to see if it’s something that you would like to have done as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@5:53\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: So essentially what we do is we do discovery, and in the discovery we try to learn about not so much you and your company brand, but more importantly, who your customers and users are. We want to understand their pain points, their challenges…um, the jobs that they’re trying to do. What a win looks like, what a fail costs them, we want to understand not just the demographics, but the psychographics. This is what we can learn. When we figure out what they want, and we give the users what they want. We typically help our clients grow and succeed. Whether that’s an adoption of an app, or the usability of a website, and that’s really what’s driving all the aesthetic decisions that we make. Now for that, we typically charge anywhere between five to ten thousand dollars to do the strategy work itself. I say this upfront because it may not be a good fit for you. And that is exclusive of any deliverables. And then through the discovery phase, we learn about what you’re trying to accomplish, how you want to do it, whether or not you need a social media marketing campaign, all these other kind of things, and then we kind of budget together with you, and you can hire whoever you want. I get paid mostly to do the thinking part, and then whether or not you want to hire our firm to do the rest of the deliverables, it’s entirely up to you. How does that sound?\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028@7:12\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: That sounds good. Do you have any idea of what the rest of the deliverables might cost?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@7:20\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Yes, I have a range, and, please don’t quote me on this, but if we’re talking about a website, to design and develop a website for you, based on the little that I know about you already, it’s going to be between 20 to 30 thousand dollars, including development. It will be a WordPress site, where you will be able to manage the content itself. It will be a custom theme that we build for you. Um, in terms of the identity, we can design the logo for 10K, and to design 3 pieces of collateral, usually a business card, an email signature, some–whatever else you think you need, that’s probably an additional 10,000 dollars, but I want to warn you, usually the website is the one that has the most range because of features and functions that you want to add to it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@8:06\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Okay. Well, I’m interested in moving forward. What would be the next steps?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@8:10\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Okay. So, what I can do is I can send you a deck that will outline our process so that you have something more concrete (I don’t know if this is something that you need to share with your team. I want to make sure that everyone feels good about doing this, because once we get into the discover phase, we’ll need to align all of the stakeholders.). So I’ll send you a deck and if that feels good, it will have an outline of a budget and timeline. That would be the next step. And then we can arrange a call to go over the proposal that I send you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay. Sounds good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Is that cool?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. You’re like being too easy on me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: No, I’m not. I’m learning. Because I’m taking…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You’re taking notes?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@8:53\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Yeah, I’m taking notes because I want to say that we’re essentially not doing exactly the same thing, but you’re right how you took the two meetings and you’re putting them into one. When I said “case studies,” I did mean “process.” As in, I’m showing (what I’m saying is a “case study”) is it’s the strategy roadmap that I walk them through, so I’m essentially doing everything that you’re doing, minus the proposal, because at that second meeting, they say, “Yes, let’s move forward.” Then we move straight to [the] contract and invoice. So, we’re kinda doing a similar thing except you’re condensing it even shorter, except then, there is work in the backend to do. But you use a template, I know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@9:33\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: We use a template and you usually shuffle around a few projects to make sure they feel like, “Yeah. These are in alignment with what I want to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@9:41\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Now most of the time, it never goes that smoothly where I just say that and they’re like, “Great! Here’s all the money in the world!” There’s usually a little push-back here and there, and we didn’t get to explore that. But I just want to move the conversation tighter, so the next time it’s proposals, we’ll review it, and then after that it’s contracts. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And that’s it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah, I still don’t see the–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: There are no visuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: The big advantage of…What’s the biggest advantage of moving from what I’m doing currently to what you’re saying?\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028@10:14\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Well, to be honest, if you had said that everything sounds great, I’d just send you no proposal–I mean, no work, I would just send you the budget and timeline, because you already bought in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: But that doesn’t usually happen, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@10:24\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: It never happens. I’m sorry. Let me restate: It almost never happens. It has happened to use before. Where I’m literally driving in from home to work, and I’m closing a hundred-thousand dollar job in my car because I wasn’t even thinking it was a real job: “And yes, this sounds great. We’ll start the schedule Fri–I’ll coordinate with the executive team to come out to Los Angeles to come and work with you.” And I said, “Okay, great. I’ll send you a budget.” So I went in, talked to my executive producer at that time, and I said, “Hey! We need to send an invoice for an estimate, and I want nothing else except for the price.” You describe it exactly the way I say it and you put a price because, at this point, what you don’t want to do is go past the sale. Once the client says, “I agree. A hundred thousand bucks. Let’s do it.” I don’t send anything else because they might see something that confuses them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So we would be able to skip that step. So in this roleplay, I volunteered to send you a deck that I shouldn’t have, so that was my bad. Because you didn’t even ask for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right. I would normally ask for it. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, you would normally ask for it. Yeah. I was prepared for you to ask for it, so, it was kinda in the typical scenario to…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: My brain was full, so I was…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s okay. So that’s why I’m like, “Yeah, boom. There it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right. So I’m doing the…essentially when you’re showing them something visually, and you’re saying it to them, and possibly having a follow-up call, I’m condensing that into a meeting whereby the end of it they’re saying, “Yes. Let’s go.” And then I skip the sending of the proposal and go straight to the contract.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. We might be nerding out a little bit too much here for people to understand exactly what the heck we’re doing. The point is, you should be–honestly, I could stand in a room with you, all day long, with no visuals, and still close the deal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: But you’re still having to send the proposal, with the work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@12:05\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Well, if necessary, I would send no proposal. If you want me to roleplay that, I could do that, but I’m just saying: All these things are, uh, in a way, crutches. Really, your mind is what they’re paying for, so you should be able to describe what you do and how you do it. Without any visual, without any deck. The deck is just to back-up what you said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I will be working on that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, well, you already have it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah. It’s just reshuffling what, how I approach it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@12:37\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Yeah. And I think, if anything, what you wanna do is describe the process in simpler, like more bite-sized pieces because the brain can only hold so much, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And so, only give them more information as they need it. So like, try to like, look at it like this is a block of marble, and then we make some kind of broad chips away at it, and then it kinda looks like a human, and they’re like, “Yeah, yeah. That’s what we really want. But what does the head look like?” And then you chisel away so that it starts to look like it’s a man and not a woman, or it’s a soldier, or a general, it’s old or young, whatever. So I only dive into it as I feel like it’s needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So the ability to expand and contract is very dynamic, so if you want more information, then I will expand it. If you don’t, [then] I close it. And it’s just being able to move and manage energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Got it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, now, what else do we need to talk about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: The quoting of “I’m so focused on strategy,” which is good because it set me on the right track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Now the pricing of the deliverables, or everything that comes after that, I’m stumbling because I don’t, I didn’t even think about that part.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. That’s okay. So you’ve seen as a member of the pro-group, you’ve seen our price sheet. It’s in there somewhere. Have you seen that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I have to look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, it’s in there. Yeah, it’s in there. We put together an old price sheet of like, the deliverables and some of them have really big ranges like the website. Some of them are much more contained because we know what it’s going to take for us to produce a logo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@14:10\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Now I’m getting all this work and a lot of leads, and now it is developing a structure to my business and systems and the process and like a very solid framework so that I can even see how much I can take on and when I need to hire people and when there’s a bottleneck, I’m in that growing pains place where I have a lot of work, but I need to know how, how can I not grow so fast that I can’t support all that work and hit the timelines and take on multiple things?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Do you feel stressed out?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I don’t feel stressed out. I feel, I feel like I’m being stretched. That hurts sometimes, but I wouldn’t say it’s stress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Are you working into the wee hours of the night?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@14:53\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Okay, time to get help. I told you before: Do not hire anybody, but I think it’s time to hire somebody. Now, I don’t mean to hire somebody like full-time and all that kind of stuff. I think you need a roster of a couple of people that you can call that are semi-available, and you just move through those people, and they understand your process and how do what you do. Ideally right now, in the next phase of your growth for 2018, what I want you to do is to focus on doing strategy, continue to refine it, on-board clients at a higher rate, so just start to move that rate higher and higher, so now that you’ve been able to close a few of these strategic engagements at 5 thousand bucks, I would say it’s the time to move to 10. I want you to move to 10, and you’ll get a little pushback, and then you’ll just get to 10, okay? And then as you settle into 10, the next thing will be from 10 to 20. You just keep doing that, keep doubling it. When you are able to charge that much for strategy, then you can afford to hire lots of different kinds of people and you know that the deliverables are kind of relative to this strategic part. Meaning that a client that’s going to nickel and dime you at 2 thousand dollars for design work is never going to agree to pay you 5 for discovery alone. Because they don’t value thinking. So this is a great filter. This is a great qualifier. If they’re not on–if they’re not gonna come on board to do strategy with you, it means that they don’t value that kind of thinking. And a lot of you that are watching this right now, are going to say, “Yeah, I do brand strategy,” just like Melinda used to say to me. But when you really know how to do it (and I told you during that show: “One day you’ll see and you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about.” That day has come obviously and you see, and it’s a game changer), it changes the entire way that you think and how you work, and it almost is like you can’t do that dumb thing anymore. You can’t just move images around. You can’t just make shapes anymore. Because it seems frivolous at this point. So you’ve crossed over this threshold that you can’t go back on, which is wonderful and I’m glad to see you do this, right? So this is what (if you guys are watching), you do need to learn actually how to do this. You can’t just say the words. And the words that you use might actually be very different from the experience that she’s having. So why don’t we take a minute here to try to explain to people a little bit more finely “strategy before” and “strategy after,” according to Melinda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Oh, yeah. It’s a big difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Can you do this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@17:21\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah. “Strategy before” was me gathering all of the questions, um, in a questionnaire, that I needed…that I personally needed to design a logo, so that was asking a lot of similar questions to what I do now, but in a completely different way. One, it was homework for my client, so it was not a face-to-face meeting, there was no trust being built during that time. I’ve definitely realized that being face-to-face with my client in the workshop meetings changes everything. They actually trust you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And who told you that wise piece of advice? [Laughter.] Yes, I did. I did. You set yourself up, but, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It’s true, it’s true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@18:03\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: And why does–what’s the difference when you’re doing face-to-face. A lot of people will think: “If it’s the same question, what is the value of face-to-face?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It’s soooo different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Tell us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@18:15\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: In the questionnaire, it was “the question.” And I might follow-up with their answer, depending on what their answer was if I didn’t understand…um, in the workshop, I can dig deeper into things (I’m trying to find golden nuggets). I’m trying to find golden nuggets that are, um, unique to them, unique to their ideal client, and then start making connections and so that my questionnaire before reached like, surface-level, like enough to get an “okay” logo out of it, and now we’re digging so deep that…to the things that will actually make the difference and truly connecting to the ideal client, whereas the other, it was just enough to get a good logo out of it. But it didn’t mean that it was connecting with our ideal client, so I’m able to ask deep questions, I’m able to make connections, and then I’m also able to help facilitate my own clients’ thinking, so then I see them light up because they say, “Oh my gosh! I just realized something about my business!” Or, “I just realized that I need to change my services!” One client actually changed her services, and she pivoted her whole business based off of our conversation during strategy–which that would not happen during a questionnaire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@19:20\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. I’m gonna show you guys an example. Melinda! We’re gonna order lunch today from Tender Greens. What would you like to eat?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Salad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: What kind of salad?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: The Caesar salad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Caesar salad. Uhh, you want bread with that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. And do you want soup?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Soup. And, vegetable soup is okay?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Now what was I doing? I was literally an “order-taker.” And that’s what the questionnaire does. It sets you up to be the person to receive direction from your client, and there was no dialogue. Okay. Let’s try this again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@20:01\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Melinda, are you hungry?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Very.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mmm. Would you like to get something to eat?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes, I would.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Do you have any kind of dietary restrictions? Are you in the mood for something?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uhh, anything that has cheese.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You love cheese?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I love cheese, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Any kind of specific cheese?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@20:24\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Umm, mozzarella.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mozzarella. Any other things I need to know about any dietary preferences? Are you like, allergic to gluten? Are you like on a fish diet?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I don’t really like fish too much, so I like to avoid that,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, no fish. So you like mozzarella cheese.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Anything else?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Umm…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Are you trying to achieve any kind of fitness or health goals?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Just satisfy my hunger at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So, what is important to you then is that it gives good portions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I want really good food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Good food?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I want really good food. Like I wanna leave there just so happy that I ate at that restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:01\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Oh. Have you ever had an experience like this somewhere else?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I have, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Where?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M] “Club 33,” Disneyland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: “Club 33?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I remember leaving there just so happy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: What did you order?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I ordered a filet mignon. I ordered probably something with cheese. I ordered (Gosh, there was like seven courses. I don’t remember.). I just remember leaving happy. That’s what I want. I want to leave happy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:30\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: I’m curious. Was being inside Disneyland a part of the experience, or was it just–were we just talking about the food?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:31\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Uh, it was part of the experience, but the food was just overarching. But yes, it made the experience really good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:39\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: And, can we try to break it up between how much of it was being in Disneyland and how much of it was the food, like on a scale of like 1 to 10, how much of that 10 would you give out to the experience versus the quality of the food?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:57\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: I think it was 40% experience, 60% food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:58\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Oh, okay. This is very important. Because initially I thought maybe I can just send somebody out to pick it up and bring it here, but then you would be only getting 60, and 60% in my book is like a “D.” For grading, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah, sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: 60% is a “D.” It’s like one letter away from an “F.” Why don’t we just do this? Let’s go there. Let me call an Über, let’s get you some tickets, and let’s get inside Disneyland, and let’s just have that meal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@22:21\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: I would love that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Let’s do it! Okay, and so that–I wanna stop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Now I’m hungry!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Are you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It does nothing for me because I have no idea what “Club 33” is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It’s so good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@22:34\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay! So in one way, I’m just listening and just writing down what she wants. In another way, I’m really trying to surface what she really wants. And I’m trying to understand something. Now, I want Melinda to do this without any bias, like, trying to help me achieve a certain goal or not. In the first instance, maybe you felt like, attended to. You felt important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Because I was like, “I’m gonna take your order!” And you were like, “Yeah! Cool! But, tell me how you felt about the second approach and what that was doing to you on a psychological, emotional level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@23:04\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I was literally imagining myself sitting there and eating the food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: And so I was feeling already the feelings I would have when I’m sitting there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: That’s part of it–that’s a big part of it actually. I didn’t feel anything. I felt important when you asked me those questions as far as the order taking, but, I was…I was enjoying the thought of the meal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@23:28\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Here’s the difference, really: First, I could’ve just gotten you something with mozzarella and you would be fine. And you just wanted to be full, so I could’ve gotten you lots of different meals, but then I got us to the perfect meal. The one that matters the most to you. And it takes time to figure that out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@23:45\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And, I could have also made a lot of assumptions when you said “Club 33.” I could have stopped there and just went out and got it. And not even help you to realize that it’s actually–40% of the experience is just being there, where you smelled the cotton candy or the vanilla, and it’s Mainstream USA and it kinda helps you to relive a childhood experience, so there’s a lot of connection to memory and celebration and ceremony that we won’t get just by giving you the plate of food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@24:14\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So, in the world of design, [let’s] bring it back to design for a second. There’s lots of logos that I could’ve given her, ones that she could’ve ordered and she could’ve said, “I want modern, sophisticated!” and that’s what the questionnaire would do for you. But once I enter into dialogue, I found that there is a preference when, when she can choose anything, she chooses to have mozzarella and I could’ve gotten that from lots of different places.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@24:35\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And then when we got a little bit close, she’s describing this certain kind of design, or something that she wants and not even realizing it, that there’s more to that than just that thing that we’re gonna make. So I’m able to surface something much deeper inside of her that gets really close to what she wants. And generally speaking, when you do that with people, they get the feels. Like, “Wow! Somebody has taken the time to kinda understand me. To really take the time to understand me.” And it takes more time. And that’s why people give you a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@25:11\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s why people change their whole business models, because you helped them to realize something.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And that is valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Now, I will send you a bill for 10,000 dollars [laughter] to help you realize what that meal means to you. Is that cool? That’s the most expensive filet mignon you’ve ever had in your life. You’re like: “I’m not paying you for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@25:32\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Now, unfortunately–or, fortunately, actually, think about this: When Melinda speaks to her next prospective vendor, she’s going to be comparing the feelings that she got versus how they made her feel. THis is why, when you do this correctly, you should have almost no competition. Because she’s going to walk away like, “Oh, yeah. I have to call these 2 more vendors to make sure. And vendor number one won’t give her a questionnaire. It’s like, “Okay, we can do it. Here’s the price.” And then, vendor number 2 might ask some questions via a questionnaire, but they’re not going to go as deep as we just did. And I think that’s one of the key things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@26:16\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Right. I would also add…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: That there are some clients who desire the questionnaire, and desire to dictate everything, and I know that there is a way to pivot (I have learned that)…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: But, it’s not as easy as someone that does wanna be–like, that is more open to be understood. Obviously, there’s–it’s an easier entry point, but there are some clients that wanna go in and just dictate–like, the ones that just want the deliverable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@26:46\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Like the logo, and they won’t budge from that, and those are the ones that want the questionnaire, and they want the old Melinda, and they’re not gonna get the old Melinda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: They can’t have it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: They can’t have it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: She’s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: She’s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You make me proud.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Thank you for watching and listening to me talk about food and cheese and, uh, Chris getting mad at me for giving one line in my…my uh (What is it?) “role play.” Which I hate. Hate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright you guys. Hopefully, hopefully you enjoyed this episode. Smash that “like” button and subscribe, and I wanna see more of Melinda and kinda track her progress as she continues to move up in the world. And I think probably, just (this is a pretty safe prediction) her next challenges will be to hire, to manage and build her team because she will not be able to keep up with the work.

Fire away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Melinda Livsey]: You had mentioned in the last episode that I could have that whole conversation without visuals and I would like to hear how.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@0:55\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Okay. So here’s the cool part: once you get into the thinking stage where you can charge for it, well thinking doesn’t have to have the traditional forms that making does. So making requires mock-ups, beautiful photography, great presentations. But thinking, you can demonstrate the value of thinking just by talking and listening. That you can do. So, we’re gonna do this where I’m gonna show you how to have this whole conversation without any visuals and feel fully confident without a website, without anything, you can do this. All you have to do is tell better stories. And, make analogies. Find metaphors. So this is where I may or may not have told you to do this already, but you kinda have to read some case studies so that you’re ready to talk about a lot of different things. Wherever the conversation goes, so this is where Bruce Lee says, “Be like water.” You wanna be like water. So I’m just controlling and directing energy so that when they push, I pull, and when they pull, I push, and so I’m always there when I’m not there–that kind of thing. This is getting into the whole zen of it. The first call typically is like, “Are they even qualified to be talking to me?” And that’s the right attitude to have. Are they qualified in the sense of, “Can they afford me? Do I align with their goals? Am I vibing with them? Is what they want realistic?” Because you can do it all, but if you need it done in two days, I’m not the right person for you. And that’s totally okay. And we’re doing it without judgement. Okay? So this is kind of like, we’re going to enter into this stage where, give me this set-up, and you and I will play. How can we do this so that you feel like this is close to your experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@2:41\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Well, being that this conversation is not close to my experience, it would be just someone calling me–are we talking about, is this the qualifying call? What call is this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Any call you want. Any call where you’re going to have to explain to them what you do without visuals. Almost all of the business that I do is without visuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Um, let’s just say it is someone who wants…it’s a start-up (because I do have a lot of start-ups contacting me) that wants to come out with an app.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Anything else?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@3:15\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: And, they want a website, and they want branding. And let’s just say they have the framework of their app done by a developer. So now they realize, “Oh! It doesn’t look good.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right. They’ve done the UX part, but they haven’t done the UI part. Okay. Alright, so, do we begin the conversation at the beginning? Is this our second call–you let me know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uhhh, I would, in my–in the way I do it, it would be the second call after I have qualified them with, let’s say, the timeline and price, and goals. Like, the overarching goal. Do we vibe? So this would be the one, let’s say the “sales” one, like, to close the lead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh. That’s very interesting. Usually I do all the closing at the first call.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay, then let’s make it that call!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Can we do it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah! ‘Cause I’m learning here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So, this’ll be call “one and a half.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@4:05\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Basically you’re gonna take the second call and you’re going to smash it into their first call. So what we’re looking for are kinds of micro-engagements, like microtransactions to gain trust and to build trust. So when we’re talking to them, I’m very deliberate and intentional in terms of the words that I choose and how I describe what it is that we do. Because that’s your best opportunity to establish who you are and what you’re gonna do for your client. So go ahead: Set it up! We’re gonna talk. The phone rings. You call me or I call you? You call me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I call you because…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right. That’s how it works. Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: You’re gonna teach me this, right? [Laughter.]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@4:44\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Hey, Chris. I saw your work. I have an app and I already have the framework done and I got the UX done, but I need a website. It looks horrible, so I need branding, and…I’d love to work with you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Great! Fantastic! First of all, thank you for calling. Before I dive into all the deliverables and things of that nature, I’m curious what you saw or why you decided to reach out to me in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Um, I reached out to you because our mutual friend referred me to you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh. Kelly?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah! Kelly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Love Kelly! I’m gonna have to send her a little thank you note.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Alright, that’s great! Yeah!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Mutual friend.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: She told me that I should talk to you because I was telling her about where we’re at and that I was looking for someone, and then your name came up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@5:25\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Okay. Perfect. So I just want to let you know (And we’re having this just as a verbal conversation, alright? So I’m not even gonna look at Melinda. It’s just, it’s a telephone conversation.) I just wanna let you know that a lot of clients come to me and ask me to do things and I’m thrilled to do them. The thing is, I’m successful at doing these things because I have a framework that I use and if you’re open to this, [then] I would like to describe it a little bit to you, to see if it’s something that you would like to have done as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@5:53\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: So essentially what we do is we do discovery, and in the discovery we try to learn about not so much you and your company brand, but more importantly, who your customers and users are. We want to understand their pain points, their challenges…um, the jobs that they’re trying to do. What a win looks like, what a fail costs them, we want to understand not just the demographics, but the psychographics. This is what we can learn. When we figure out what they want, and we give the users what they want. We typically help our clients grow and succeed. Whether that’s an adoption of an app, or the usability of a website, and that’s really what’s driving all the aesthetic decisions that we make. Now for that, we typically charge anywhere between five to ten thousand dollars to do the strategy work itself. I say this upfront because it may not be a good fit for you. And that is exclusive of any deliverables. And then through the discovery phase, we learn about what you’re trying to accomplish, how you want to do it, whether or not you need a social media marketing campaign, all these other kind of things, and then we kind of budget together with you, and you can hire whoever you want. I get paid mostly to do the thinking part, and then whether or not you want to hire our firm to do the rest of the deliverables, it’s entirely up to you. How does that sound?\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028@7:12\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: That sounds good. Do you have any idea of what the rest of the deliverables might cost?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@7:20\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Yes, I have a range, and, please don’t quote me on this, but if we’re talking about a website, to design and develop a website for you, based on the little that I know about you already, it’s going to be between 20 to 30 thousand dollars, including development. It will be a WordPress site, where you will be able to manage the content itself. It will be a custom theme that we build for you. Um, in terms of the identity, we can design the logo for 10K, and to design 3 pieces of collateral, usually a business card, an email signature, some–whatever else you think you need, that’s probably an additional 10,000 dollars, but I want to warn you, usually the website is the one that has the most range because of features and functions that you want to add to it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@8:06\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Okay. Well, I’m interested in moving forward. What would be the next steps?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@8:10\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Okay. So, what I can do is I can send you a deck that will outline our process so that you have something more concrete (I don’t know if this is something that you need to share with your team. I want to make sure that everyone feels good about doing this, because once we get into the discover phase, we’ll need to align all of the stakeholders.). So I’ll send you a deck and if that feels good, it will have an outline of a budget and timeline. That would be the next step. And then we can arrange a call to go over the proposal that I send you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay. Sounds good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Is that cool?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. You’re like being too easy on me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: No, I’m not. I’m learning. Because I’m taking…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You’re taking notes?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@8:53\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Yeah, I’m taking notes because I want to say that we’re essentially not doing exactly the same thing, but you’re right how you took the two meetings and you’re putting them into one. When I said “case studies,” I did mean “process.” As in, I’m showing (what I’m saying is a “case study”) is it’s the strategy roadmap that I walk them through, so I’m essentially doing everything that you’re doing, minus the proposal, because at that second meeting, they say, “Yes, let’s move forward.” Then we move straight to [the] contract and invoice. So, we’re kinda doing a similar thing except you’re condensing it even shorter, except then, there is work in the backend to do. But you use a template, I know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@9:33\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: We use a template and you usually shuffle around a few projects to make sure they feel like, “Yeah. These are in alignment with what I want to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@9:41\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Now most of the time, it never goes that smoothly where I just say that and they’re like, “Great! Here’s all the money in the world!” There’s usually a little push-back here and there, and we didn’t get to explore that. But I just want to move the conversation tighter, so the next time it’s proposals, we’ll review it, and then after that it’s contracts. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And that’s it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah, I still don’t see the–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: There are no visuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: The big advantage of…What’s the biggest advantage of moving from what I’m doing currently to what you’re saying?\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028@10:14\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Well, to be honest, if you had said that everything sounds great, I’d just send you no proposal–I mean, no work, I would just send you the budget and timeline, because you already bought in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: But that doesn’t usually happen, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@10:24\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: It never happens. I’m sorry. Let me restate: It almost never happens. It has happened to use before. Where I’m literally driving in from home to work, and I’m closing a hundred-thousand dollar job in my car because I wasn’t even thinking it was a real job: “And yes, this sounds great. We’ll start the schedule Fri–I’ll coordinate with the executive team to come out to Los Angeles to come and work with you.” And I said, “Okay, great. I’ll send you a budget.” So I went in, talked to my executive producer at that time, and I said, “Hey! We need to send an invoice for an estimate, and I want nothing else except for the price.” You describe it exactly the way I say it and you put a price because, at this point, what you don’t want to do is go past the sale. Once the client says, “I agree. A hundred thousand bucks. Let’s do it.” I don’t send anything else because they might see something that confuses them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So we would be able to skip that step. So in this roleplay, I volunteered to send you a deck that I shouldn’t have, so that was my bad. Because you didn’t even ask for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right. I would normally ask for it. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, you would normally ask for it. Yeah. I was prepared for you to ask for it, so, it was kinda in the typical scenario to…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: My brain was full, so I was…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s okay. So that’s why I’m like, “Yeah, boom. There it is.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right. So I’m doing the…essentially when you’re showing them something visually, and you’re saying it to them, and possibly having a follow-up call, I’m condensing that into a meeting whereby the end of it they’re saying, “Yes. Let’s go.” And then I skip the sending of the proposal and go straight to the contract.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. We might be nerding out a little bit too much here for people to understand exactly what the heck we’re doing. The point is, you should be–honestly, I could stand in a room with you, all day long, with no visuals, and still close the deal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: But you’re still having to send the proposal, with the work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@12:05\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Well, if necessary, I would send no proposal. If you want me to roleplay that, I could do that, but I’m just saying: All these things are, uh, in a way, crutches. Really, your mind is what they’re paying for, so you should be able to describe what you do and how you do it. Without any visual, without any deck. The deck is just to back-up what you said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I will be working on that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, well, you already have it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah. It’s just reshuffling what, how I approach it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@12:37\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Yeah. And I think, if anything, what you wanna do is describe the process in simpler, like more bite-sized pieces because the brain can only hold so much, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And so, only give them more information as they need it. So like, try to like, look at it like this is a block of marble, and then we make some kind of broad chips away at it, and then it kinda looks like a human, and they’re like, “Yeah, yeah. That’s what we really want. But what does the head look like?” And then you chisel away so that it starts to look like it’s a man and not a woman, or it’s a soldier, or a general, it’s old or young, whatever. So I only dive into it as I feel like it’s needed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So the ability to expand and contract is very dynamic, so if you want more information, then I will expand it. If you don’t, [then] I close it. And it’s just being able to move and manage energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Got it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, now, what else do we need to talk about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: The quoting of “I’m so focused on strategy,” which is good because it set me on the right track.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Now the pricing of the deliverables, or everything that comes after that, I’m stumbling because I don’t, I didn’t even think about that part.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. That’s okay. So you’ve seen as a member of the pro-group, you’ve seen our price sheet. It’s in there somewhere. Have you seen that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I have to look.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, it’s in there. Yeah, it’s in there. We put together an old price sheet of like, the deliverables and some of them have really big ranges like the website. Some of them are much more contained because we know what it’s going to take for us to produce a logo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@14:10\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Now I’m getting all this work and a lot of leads, and now it is developing a structure to my business and systems and the process and like a very solid framework so that I can even see how much I can take on and when I need to hire people and when there’s a bottleneck, I’m in that growing pains place where I have a lot of work, but I need to know how, how can I not grow so fast that I can’t support all that work and hit the timelines and take on multiple things?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Do you feel stressed out?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I don’t feel stressed out. I feel, I feel like I’m being stretched. That hurts sometimes, but I wouldn’t say it’s stress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Are you working into the wee hours of the night?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@14:53\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Okay, time to get help. I told you before: Do not hire anybody, but I think it’s time to hire somebody. Now, I don’t mean to hire somebody like full-time and all that kind of stuff. I think you need a roster of a couple of people that you can call that are semi-available, and you just move through those people, and they understand your process and how do what you do. Ideally right now, in the next phase of your growth for 2018, what I want you to do is to focus on doing strategy, continue to refine it, on-board clients at a higher rate, so just start to move that rate higher and higher, so now that you’ve been able to close a few of these strategic engagements at 5 thousand bucks, I would say it’s the time to move to 10. I want you to move to 10, and you’ll get a little pushback, and then you’ll just get to 10, okay? And then as you settle into 10, the next thing will be from 10 to 20. You just keep doing that, keep doubling it. When you are able to charge that much for strategy, then you can afford to hire lots of different kinds of people and you know that the deliverables are kind of relative to this strategic part. Meaning that a client that’s going to nickel and dime you at 2 thousand dollars for design work is never going to agree to pay you 5 for discovery alone. Because they don’t value thinking. So this is a great filter. This is a great qualifier. If they’re not on–if they’re not gonna come on board to do strategy with you, it means that they don’t value that kind of thinking. And a lot of you that are watching this right now, are going to say, “Yeah, I do brand strategy,” just like Melinda used to say to me. But when you really know how to do it (and I told you during that show: “One day you’ll see and you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about.” That day has come obviously and you see, and it’s a game changer), it changes the entire way that you think and how you work, and it almost is like you can’t do that dumb thing anymore. You can’t just move images around. You can’t just make shapes anymore. Because it seems frivolous at this point. So you’ve crossed over this threshold that you can’t go back on, which is wonderful and I’m glad to see you do this, right? So this is what (if you guys are watching), you do need to learn actually how to do this. You can’t just say the words. And the words that you use might actually be very different from the experience that she’s having. So why don’t we take a minute here to try to explain to people a little bit more finely “strategy before” and “strategy after,” according to Melinda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Oh, yeah. It’s a big difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Can you do this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@17:21\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah. “Strategy before” was me gathering all of the questions, um, in a questionnaire, that I needed…that I personally needed to design a logo, so that was asking a lot of similar questions to what I do now, but in a completely different way. One, it was homework for my client, so it was not a face-to-face meeting, there was no trust being built during that time. I’ve definitely realized that being face-to-face with my client in the workshop meetings changes everything. They actually trust you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And who told you that wise piece of advice? [Laughter.] Yes, I did. I did. You set yourself up, but, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It’s true, it’s true.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@18:03\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: And why does–what’s the difference when you’re doing face-to-face. A lot of people will think: “If it’s the same question, what is the value of face-to-face?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It’s soooo different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Tell us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@18:15\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: In the questionnaire, it was “the question.” And I might follow-up with their answer, depending on what their answer was if I didn’t understand…um, in the workshop, I can dig deeper into things (I’m trying to find golden nuggets). I’m trying to find golden nuggets that are, um, unique to them, unique to their ideal client, and then start making connections and so that my questionnaire before reached like, surface-level, like enough to get an “okay” logo out of it, and now we’re digging so deep that…to the things that will actually make the difference and truly connecting to the ideal client, whereas the other, it was just enough to get a good logo out of it. But it didn’t mean that it was connecting with our ideal client, so I’m able to ask deep questions, I’m able to make connections, and then I’m also able to help facilitate my own clients’ thinking, so then I see them light up because they say, “Oh my gosh! I just realized something about my business!” Or, “I just realized that I need to change my services!” One client actually changed her services, and she pivoted her whole business based off of our conversation during strategy–which that would not happen during a questionnaire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@19:20\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. I’m gonna show you guys an example. Melinda! We’re gonna order lunch today from Tender Greens. What would you like to eat?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Salad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: What kind of salad?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: The Caesar salad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Caesar salad. Uhh, you want bread with that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. And do you want soup?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Soup. And, vegetable soup is okay?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Now what was I doing? I was literally an “order-taker.” And that’s what the questionnaire does. It sets you up to be the person to receive direction from your client, and there was no dialogue. Okay. Let’s try this again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@20:01\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Melinda, are you hungry?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Very.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mmm. Would you like to get something to eat?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes, I would.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Do you have any kind of dietary restrictions? Are you in the mood for something?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uhh, anything that has cheese.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You love cheese?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I love cheese, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Any kind of specific cheese?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@20:24\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Umm, mozzarella.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mozzarella. Any other things I need to know about any dietary preferences? Are you like, allergic to gluten? Are you like on a fish diet?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I don’t really like fish too much, so I like to avoid that,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, no fish. So you like mozzarella cheese.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Anything else?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Umm…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Are you trying to achieve any kind of fitness or health goals?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Just satisfy my hunger at the moment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So, what is important to you then is that it gives good portions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I want really good food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Good food?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I want really good food. Like I wanna leave there just so happy that I ate at that restaurant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:01\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Oh. Have you ever had an experience like this somewhere else?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I have, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Where?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M] “Club 33,” Disneyland.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: “Club 33?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I remember leaving there just so happy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: What did you order?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I ordered a filet mignon. I ordered probably something with cheese. I ordered (Gosh, there was like seven courses. I don’t remember.). I just remember leaving happy. That’s what I want. I want to leave happy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:30\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: I’m curious. Was being inside Disneyland a part of the experience, or was it just–were we just talking about the food?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:31\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Uh, it was part of the experience, but the food was just overarching. But yes, it made the experience really good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:39\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: And, can we try to break it up between how much of it was being in Disneyland and how much of it was the food, like on a scale of like 1 to 10, how much of that 10 would you give out to the experience versus the quality of the food?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:57\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: I think it was 40% experience, 60% food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@21:58\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Oh, okay. This is very important. Because initially I thought maybe I can just send somebody out to pick it up and bring it here, but then you would be only getting 60, and 60% in my book is like a “D.” For grading, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah, sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: 60% is a “D.” It’s like one letter away from an “F.” Why don’t we just do this? Let’s go there. Let me call an Über, let’s get you some tickets, and let’s get inside Disneyland, and let’s just have that meal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@22:21\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: I would love that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Let’s do it! Okay, and so that–I wanna stop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Now I’m hungry!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Are you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It does nothing for me because I have no idea what “Club 33” is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It’s so good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@22:34\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay! So in one way, I’m just listening and just writing down what she wants. In another way, I’m really trying to surface what she really wants. And I’m trying to understand something. Now, I want Melinda to do this without any bias, like, trying to help me achieve a certain goal or not. In the first instance, maybe you felt like, attended to. You felt important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Because I was like, “I’m gonna take your order!” And you were like, “Yeah! Cool! But, tell me how you felt about the second approach and what that was doing to you on a psychological, emotional level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@23:04\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I was literally imagining myself sitting there and eating the food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: And so I was feeling already the feelings I would have when I’m sitting there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: That’s part of it–that’s a big part of it actually. I didn’t feel anything. I felt important when you asked me those questions as far as the order taking, but, I was…I was enjoying the thought of the meal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@23:28\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Here’s the difference, really: First, I could’ve just gotten you something with mozzarella and you would be fine. And you just wanted to be full, so I could’ve gotten you lots of different meals, but then I got us to the perfect meal. The one that matters the most to you. And it takes time to figure that out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@23:45\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And, I could have also made a lot of assumptions when you said “Club 33.” I could have stopped there and just went out and got it. And not even help you to realize that it’s actually–40% of the experience is just being there, where you smelled the cotton candy or the vanilla, and it’s Mainstream USA and it kinda helps you to relive a childhood experience, so there’s a lot of connection to memory and celebration and ceremony that we won’t get just by giving you the plate of food.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@24:14\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So, in the world of design, [let’s] bring it back to design for a second. There’s lots of logos that I could’ve given her, ones that she could’ve ordered and she could’ve said, “I want modern, sophisticated!” and that’s what the questionnaire would do for you. But once I enter into dialogue, I found that there is a preference when, when she can choose anything, she chooses to have mozzarella and I could’ve gotten that from lots of different places.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@24:35\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And then when we got a little bit close, she’s describing this certain kind of design, or something that she wants and not even realizing it, that there’s more to that than just that thing that we’re gonna make. So I’m able to surface something much deeper inside of her that gets really close to what she wants. And generally speaking, when you do that with people, they get the feels. Like, “Wow! Somebody has taken the time to kinda understand me. To really take the time to understand me.” And it takes more time. And that’s why people give you a hug.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@25:11\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s why people change their whole business models, because you helped them to realize something.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And that is valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Now, I will send you a bill for 10,000 dollars [laughter] to help you realize what that meal means to you. Is that cool? That’s the most expensive filet mignon you’ve ever had in your life. You’re like: “I’m not paying you for that.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@25:32\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Now, unfortunately–or, fortunately, actually, think about this: When Melinda speaks to her next prospective vendor, she’s going to be comparing the feelings that she got versus how they made her feel. THis is why, when you do this correctly, you should have almost no competition. Because she’s going to walk away like, “Oh, yeah. I have to call these 2 more vendors to make sure. And vendor number one won’t give her a questionnaire. It’s like, “Okay, we can do it. Here’s the price.” And then, vendor number 2 might ask some questions via a questionnaire, but they’re not going to go as deep as we just did. And I think that’s one of the key things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@26:16\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Right. I would also add…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: That there are some clients who desire the questionnaire, and desire to dictate everything, and I know that there is a way to pivot (I have learned that)…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uh-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: But, it’s not as easy as someone that does wanna be–like, that is more open to be understood. Obviously, there’s–it’s an easier entry point, but there are some clients that wanna go in and just dictate–like, the ones that just want the deliverable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@26:46\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Like the logo, and they won’t budge from that, and those are the ones that want the questionnaire, and they want the old Melinda, and they’re not gonna get the old Melinda.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: They can’t have it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: They can’t have it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: She’s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: She’s gone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You make me proud.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Thank you for watching and listening to me talk about food and cheese and, uh, Chris getting mad at me for giving one line in my…my uh (What is it?) “role play.” Which I hate. Hate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright you guys. Hopefully, hopefully you enjoyed this episode. Smash that “like” button and subscribe, and I wanna see more of Melinda and kinda track her progress as she continues to move up in the world. And I think probably, just (this is a pretty safe prediction) her next challenges will be to hire, to manage and build her team because she will not be able to keep up with the work. And that’s all I have for you guys, see you guys next time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",

I’m catching up with—you guessed it—with Melinda, and she’s here. And she’s had some tremendous growth. So I wanna talk to her, and, without further ado: Melinda, what has been going on with your life? Last we spoke, last time we spoke…LAST TIME WE SPOKE! She was like, “Chris! All my work is gone! What did you do to me? Are you trying to ruin me or what?” And I said, “You know: Stay with the plan, follow the process. Trust me, and I’ll take care of you.” So, wonderful things have happened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Melinda Livsey]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You are leading the charge for a bunch of designers to start to charge for their knowledge. So I wanna hear kinda where you’re at, and then I’m gonna ask you a bunch of questions about how you got to be where you’re at.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Alright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Give us the like the BIG update.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: The big update, well, last time I was here we were here with Rebecca and I was saying how all of my leads had dried up and my work, and I was probably eating Top Ramen and something, ugh…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh, hush! HUSH!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Wasting away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Top Ramen over Kobe steak! But yes!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: But now! Yes! Yes! So since then, one huge thing that’s changed are the leads. The leads are coming in. I have a lot, a lot of leads, which now (and I’ve sold jobs at a much higher price), now I have to do them, and so I’m dealing with actually—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C] New problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah, new problems! Great problems! I’m not complaining, I’m very thankful. Um, but it’s a completely different—it’s a huge shift. A huge shift that just started…I would say right after Thanksgiving, I got all the leads.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: So it does take time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It took a while.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I just want to let everybody know: It does take some time. You all expect instant results. Like, if I do X, then Y will happen immediately. And it doesn’t work like that. Real life does not work like that. It takes time to, to prepare the soil, to, to plant, and then you don’t get the harvest for some time. So let’s just get into the nitty and the gritty, if you will. The nitty-gritty, which is: You’re getting a bunch of leads now, which is fantastic (we’ll talk more about how you got those leads), but let’s talk about charging more. Let’s just dangle the carrot out there for them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@2:32\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: What do you mean that you’re charging more? Like, how much more? Where do you go from and where are you at now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @2:38\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I went from 1) not doing strategy at all (using a questionnaire as my “strategy,” I would say)…I mean, I wasn’t charging for that, and now I am charging. I’m leading with that. I’m actually selling that–I’m not really selling. I’m trying to align with my client. I don’t want to say sell because I’m not pushing anyone into anything. Um, I’m aligning with their goals and their problems, and I am offering them strategy first, really as the only option if they would like to work with me. And, um, I’m presenting it in a way that they’ve fallen in love with strategy, and then I’m charging for it. So that is a massive change from not charging for a questionnaire (which I DID call my “strategy”), to actually doing in-person workshops and selling that strategy. That’s a big difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. I think you’ve done an excellent job of avoiding my question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Well, repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: How much are you charging from–How much are you charging today relative to what you were just charging a little while ago? Can you give us an idea?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Well, it’s just completely different because the structure is different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well then, tell me about that structure and then the price attached to that structure then.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@3:48\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]:Okay. So previously, I charged zero for strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Now I charge (the last one) I’ve charged 5,000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: 5,000 bucks?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: So I went from zero…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: WOO!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: …to 5,000 for strategy alone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C] Okay. So that’s a big number for a lot of people to process right now and some people are like: “Well, what is strategy? Like, what do you mean you charge 5,000 and why weren’t you able to do it before?” So we’ll spend a little time talking about this part. And I think the people want to know, ‘cause this is radically different because people are struggling in the streets, wherever you’re watching this, to even get four or five hundred bucks for a logo. And that’s like WORK. You’re talking about like getting paid to think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s a good problem to have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@4:40\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. So let’s talk a little bit about that then. Um, in terms of, What is strategy to you now? We kind of understand a little bit about what you referenced before, but, now that you’re doing it, tell the people what it is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Tell the people what it is. Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Pretend like—okay—pretend like I’m a client.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Oh, man!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Like: Ding dong! Hey, Melinda! I wanna work with you. I saw your work!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Oh, role play! Again?!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Laughter.]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You can’t avoid it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Chris, you know how this turns out!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It turns out great every single time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah, every single time. It’s great! It, yeah…Well it’s…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: …Open to interpretation. Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, so—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I’m just a brand new client. This time it’s gonna be really easy because you’re a super pro now, so, you know: Ring, ring! Here we go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@5:18\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I wanna work with you! I saw your website, I’ve seen you on all these podcasts, and your Instagram is amazing—I wanna work with you. How do we do that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: You wanna work with me? What are you looking for?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I’m looking to rebrand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Oh! You’re looking to rebrand. Okay. So have you thought of a certain budget? Do you have a certain budget set aside for this?\u003cbr/\u003e  \u003cbr/\u003e[C]: I don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: You don’t. Well, okay. Typically, depending on the size of your company, marketing efforts are around 5% to 10%, depending on what your goal is, so, of your gross revenue, so, with that said, what’s your goal of rebranding? Why are you even…what makes you want to rebrand?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I just feel like it’s outdated, and you know, I hired some friend of the family who did it originally and it’s been okay, but we’re growing and I feel like when I look at what we do, I don’t feel proud of our identity. I’m not proud at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @6:19\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: And so, could you describe to me where you’re at currently? As far as where you want to grow? I hear you wanna grow, so that’s your ideal. And you want to continue to grow, so that’s your ideal. But you feel that you are stale or…Can you describe to me what that feeling is? Why do you feel that way about your brand?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Well, I’m gonna show you this: Does this look jenky to you? This feels like it’s not professional, it doesn’t feel like we’re innovative, it doesn’t feel like it’s reflective of what our value is. We’re an 80 million dollar company, and this looks like some kid did it, because in truth, some kid did do it. I want a professional touch. I saw the work that you do: It’s very classy, it’s very stylish, it’s very modern–that’s what I want for my company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @7:05\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Great! Well, it sounds like (from what I’m hearing) your ideal client…are they feeling the same thing that you are, too? Are you losing them? Are you gaining them?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Hmm, I don’t know. I think we would like to have more clients…We’re growing, so, I think we’re gaining clients and customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @7:25\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Well, typically during this conversation, I would have something visual to show, and I would be writing down where you are (which is here) and then I would be writing down your ideal (which is there), so that they can see it visually and we’re both looking at something together. And then I would break it down where the middle (this is your aim), so I start asking you questions: “Well, what is this…What’s an attainable goal about midway between where you are now and where you wanna be? What would that look like to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Well, you know, I don’t know yet. I mean, I just, really would like to start with the rebrand, so I’m thinking: we need a new logo, we need a new identity system, probably somewhere down the line, we’ll need a website to reflect all this stuff, but for right now, I think the identity is really important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @8:06\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Great, so, those are the tasks that will get us to that goal, [but] what does that goal actually look like for your company? Where is your company during that time? Is it–did your company grow in revenue? Do you want your company to grow as far as sales, as far as attracting a certain kind of customer? What does that look like? Because those things (the logo, the rebrand) are more of a vehicle to get you to the goal, or a task to get you there, but they aren’t the end goal. So they’re there to get you to your goal. So what would that look like for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Maybe I’m not understanding this: I just feel like things don’t look very good right now. And I feel like, if we could just do that, I’d be more proud to represent ourselves like, as we go out into the world. I almost feel ashamed. Like, I don’t want to even give you my business card right now. Do you know what I mean?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @8:58\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah, yeah. So then, an attainable goal that I’m hearing is that, it would be that you’re proud of your company, and that you would want to go around and that you want to be proud of it, that you want to show it off, you wanna feel that you are above your competitors. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Sounds good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @9:14\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Well, this is how I do it! (And then, you would see visually, how strategy comes into play with that.) Strategy is the core that we have to start with, the next thing are objectives (so that would be something like UX, that would be marketing funnels, that would be goals (measurable goals), from there we have deliverables. And so, if we actually start with the logo first, we’re going to have a very shell of a brand, and it’s not going to be held up by anything because there’s no goals, and there’s no purpose. So we actually start with brand strategy first. And then you would see a goal, or you would see a diagram of that if you were sitting down with me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Okay. This feels right. I feel like you’re the right person to do this. So, how much do you charge to do this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @10:00\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: So typically, brand strategy is, it starts at 5,000 and it can range all the way to 15. And you would see also what those options would be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Okay, and what do I get for that? Like, why do I have to do this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @10:11\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: It sounds like you want to get to your goal and typically my clients, which in this conversation, we would end up seeing that you’re possibly not focused, that you’re trying to do several things at once, but not getting very far, and so I have some things to walk through to show that, and usually clients are like: Yes, I totally relate to that. So with that, focus and clarity are what I’m mainly leading with, with strategy, and so the first package is strategy to find out who the ideal client is, to know them very well, to also provide a marketing funnel strategy (so the overarching funnel of how does the client become aware of you, all the way to, how do they end up  being an advocate for your company)? Because you want people to share and re-feed the funnel so that you don’t have to keep putting money in. So does that sound good? Put money back in to gain those ideal clients if they’re your advocates?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That sounds great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @11:09\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: And we would also go over your brand, too, and who you are so that what you said about wanting to be confident in your brand and be able to feel like you’re above the competition, we would also nail down all the attributes, the positioning statement, the value proposition, in that early time so that we know where we’re going and you know where you’re going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e@11:30\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: That sounds all wonderful, but I just want you to do our identity. Can we just skip this process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e  @11:36\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Well, do you have a brand strategy already?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I have something, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: You have something? And what does that entail?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Uh, I can send it to you after this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @11:51\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Maybe I can kinda share with you what we have. It has a little bit about our mission statement, what some of our beliefs are…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @11:53\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Okay. That more stands for something that is aligned with your business plan, and this is more aligned with how you reach your ideal client. So they’re a little bit different. And I work through this certain process, so if you’d like to work with me, then we do start at brand strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @12:12\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: So you’re saying you won’t do this unless we hire you to do the brand strategy?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @12:17\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: That’s correct because I feel that I’ve actually used to do this, I used to be a freelancer and I used to take on the projects that were the deliverables, and I didn’t even think about what my clients’ goals were, and if we were reaching those goals, and if we were helping the client get to those goals, and it was–I ended up being an expense. And I don’t want to do that to my clients anymore, so I have switched over to the world of brand strategy because I want to align with my clients’ goals, and then have them align with their own clients. (So this is again, there is a diagram here where it shows “brand strategy,” “objectives,” and “deliverables.” So people typically come to me for the deliverables, but there is no goal or no strategy attached, so you don’t know if you’re reaching your goal. So then, it always ends up being an expense and not an investment.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @13:08\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Okay, you’ve given me a lot to think about here. So if this strategy part costs $5,000 dollars (and I hear a lot of people say this, so I’m not sure if y’all’s are saying the same thing), but if I have to spend 5,000 bucks, then okay. What’s the logo gonna cost me?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @13:26\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: The logo is going to cost you a minimum of 5,000 on top of the strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Okay, a minimum. Okay, what would affect the price?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: The complexity…the…(I’m breaking character.).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You, you can’t just decide when you want to break character!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Well, yes! I can! I can!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yo! Yo! My brain can’t process like when you’re like: Is she breaking character?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@13:47\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Well I have visuals, so we’re breaking my own process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: No, we’re just having a conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I know, I don’t have this…I do visuals, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mmm. Alright. \u2028\u2028[M]: So I go from initial…\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: I gotta coach you on how to do this without anything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Well I, I have to do it with visuals currently because I have nothing on my site to show this, at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Well, it doesn’t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay, well then…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You have it up here (*points to his head*)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Do teach, Master Do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I will. I will, but let’s just finish this out though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e@14:08\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Okay. So I’m just saying this because my process that I’m currently doing, this would not happen. Because I have case studies to show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: And I have a process to show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: So.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Ah. Interesting. Okay. So, where were we? I was asking about like—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Logo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Logo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And it’s like, “What can impact the price?” And you answered that, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. Now you see, now we’re like busy arguing about something, now I can’t remember anymore! It’s like an old married couple over here! It’s like, “What are we talking about?” Okay. Alright. I think we got your role playing. I think I have some tips for you, but we’ll circle back to that later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e@14:48\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Okay. So we’ve established now that you charge 5,000 dollars to do strategy, and it really can impact the client’s business, which makes you feel good. It gets you a seat at the table so you’re not an “order taker,” you’re an advisor to the client.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Correct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And I like that you stood your ground, so if they insist that this is not going to happen, what–how do you say it? So let me get back into the role play. Don’t break character now! Stop pointing to the screen like, “At this point—“\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Well, I have to—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: No! No!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M] Because you’re breaking my process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So what?\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: I’m just! Well, if you want to—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Improvise! Improvise!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: But if you want a true example of what goes on, then…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: If you don’t…If you want something new, that’s okay. But if you really want to know what’s going on, then, this is not what’s going on!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s too much! It’s too much!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay. Go back to strategy then!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: No! We’re moving on. I don’t even know what we’re talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: We’re talking about if I don’t—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: We’re going to have to do some editing here!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: If I don’t take them on, then—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It’s deliverable only.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@15:45\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: So, so, get, get rid of me then. Let’s just say like: “Look, I really like you. I think I can spend 5 to 8 thousand dollars on the logo by itself, I’m just not really into this other thing. I just, I need to get this thing done, and we’ve had somebody do this before and it really got us nowhere. So, are you saying that you won’t take on this job?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uh, see it—I would…delve into the why…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Things went bad over there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Stay in character!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay. I thought you were leading me somewhere else. This is bad. See? This is…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: This is why Melinda never comes on the show! So that’s why she won’t come on the show anymore. Alright. \u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Ooooookay. Well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yes?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: That is—[Laughter.] Because I don’t feel that it would get you to your goal, that I’ll have to refer you to someone else that would take on a logo only, from the start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Hmm, okay, that’s a bummer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I would love to work with you, though. I would, truly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I would love to get those referrals. Who are you gonna send me?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @16:49\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: I have a list. I’ll send you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Are you checking it twice?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I’ll send you right after this call. Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. End scene! We’ll, we’ll stop it right there. Okay, so let’s get back to this whole thing. Uh, I’m gonna have to teach you how to say no. I’m gonna have to teach you how to do this without visuals, and so that you can be in the flow. A lot of this (okay, you’re relatively new still, relatively speaking), so soon you’ll be able to do this kinda over the phone while you’re driving to have Starbucks. It’ll be no problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: And the initial call, which I took from you last time, was to qualify the price. So the initial one is that and then the second one is (just letting you know what I’m current doing) to get them on a Skype call or an in-person meeting if I am local. And that’s why I use visuals because I have nothing on my site. Because I lead with deliverables at the moment on my website, which is not going to be that way next month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Good. You already know the task.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I already know. So that’s why I felt like instead of having things on my website and case studies that I’m gonna have them in-person and show them and talk them through it that…which so far has worked out for me to get to five thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @18:05\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Alright, so! I’m gonna say this because I’m gonna give voice to our audience that are watching: They’re like, “Oh, my God! I can’t believe she’s saying no to a five to eight thousand dollar logo!” How are you gonna handle that criticism? Like, what did you charge to do this, like, a year ago?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: A year ago? I was charging…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Before we met.\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: The top one, which was a branding package, was $6300.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @18:28\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Okay, so a year ago, you were happy with $6300. And now, just a year later, if somebody’s gonna offer you five to eight thousand dollars to do a logo again, and you’re like, “Hm.” How do you speak to that? Like, what has happened to you? So spoiled so fast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Well, those people that are complaining, now they have a client! Potentially.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That you’re gonna give them\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: That I will give them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: And why would you do that now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @18:53\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Why would I do that now? Because of the reasons that I was telling you, that, as the client, one, I know that it’s not necessarily (I don’t know this for sure, but) it’s not necessarily gonna reach their goal, and so, if everything’s not in alignment as far as strategy and their goals and we’re not getting anywhere, we’re just checking things off a list, so it’s like: “Do you wanna have–do you just wanna check something off a list or do you want to be effective?” And I (now that I’ve tasted the greatness, I wanna be effective! Because to me, that’s worth more than money. It really is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I see. So it’s almost like you took the pill and you entered into the matrix, and now you know it’s all fake. That’s not cheeseburger that you’re eating, it’s like code, and you can’t go back. You’d rather live in the raw, dirty world that we know, rather than go back to that place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That’s interesting. Okay, so, there’s a lot of people in our group (in our pro-coaching group) who are still… (I don’t wanna use the word “struggling,” but it’s still a challenge for them to get to that place where they can charge five thousand dollars just for the thinking part. There’s only a handful. There’s about half a dozen of you guys so far that have separated out (and I know that there are a lot of people that think that, “Mmm, I charge strategy for all of that, but it’s all lumped together). So first of all, I want to say kudos to you for being able to do it, and also, kind of listening to the advice that I give you, and, a lot of people are like: “I’m doing it.” But they don’t do it the way that I tell them to do it, so then I’m like, “You’re not doing it.” Right? So some people still kind of mush it together and I don’t think they’re confident enough to separate it apart. Because once you separate it, you’re validating that there’s value there, and that they’re willing to hire you for that reason, and that’s excellent. So I have to ask you this question: What makes you so special? What makes you so different? Because I give advice out to strangers on the Internet, I give advice to the coaching group, one-on-one coaching…Why, why were you able to achieve what they weren’t able to achieve?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @20:59\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: That’s a deep question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That’s what I’m here for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I feel like it’s a simple answer though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: What is it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I just did it. I just started. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That’s helpful. [Laugher.]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @21:10\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Well, it is to those who are stalled. Just do the first small, very small step. Whatever that is. For me, it was: Learn how to do strategy. The second one, it was: Get someone to agree to let me do strategy for them for their company. One of them was my cousin! One of them was my good friend/client that I have worked with before. Uhh, another one was a previous client. Um, someone else was a friend, and, yeah, I think one other was a previous client as well, so, a lot of them were friends, they were family members, they were previous clients, that I felt comfortable with, and they agreed to, to let me do strategy for them. And with every single one of those, I got more confident with it. And then I realized, “Oh my gosh! There’s magic in this!” Like I, I was converted after that!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: The skies parted and this ray of light came and you’re like, “Oh, it’s so warm in the sunlight!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @22:08\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: But it really came–It came after every single strategy that I did for someone, I saw the difference that it made or the lightbulb that came on with them and the clarity that they had, and then I thought, “Oh my gosh! If this happened with the first person, just think about what will happen with the next, and the next! And, every time I did it, yeah! I got better, I changed my strategy document and my process as I went ‘cause I was seeing the needs, or I saw the roadblocks, or what was not necessary. Or where things got confusing and I straightened those out and, every time…Every time I do strategy now, I add something or I take something away because of what I’ve done previously, and now I’m…I feel confident in what I’m charging and I feel confident in even raising my prices because I see the impact that it’s making on the businesses that I’ve already worked with–and the people! It’s not just the business, it’s the (like, I had one client–and she’s the one that was my friend, she said, “You’re the only one that I feel got, who understands my vision.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Mmm. Did she give you a hug?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Pretty much, yeah. She did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Did she cry?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Uh, I don’t know about crying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Alright. I’m gonna get you to “Do” status where they start crying and huggin’ you. Like, “Oh my God! You’re so good!” Alright, this is good. ‘Cause it can be cathartic. I just wanna say that. “Cathartic.” And we’ll put the definition right there: “cathartic.” Okay, so, you did a great job of explaining something, but you didn’t answer my question. I wanna get into your mind. I wanna crawl into this brain and say like, there’s some random dude that you saw on the Internet. And you come in, and you chat with me a couple of times, a little bit of coaching and I told you that you’re not doing strategy. And, you took it like a champ. You got like an iron chin because I smacked you and you were like, “Yeah, what else you got?” I’m like, “Oh, I got more.” And then, you get into the core framework, and you quietly go off and do your thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @24:03\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: It is a special somebody that can just take a little bit of information and even though it’s counter to everything that they’ve done before that moment, yet you’re willing to just move forward without sitting there and thinking, over-analyzing, over-thinking, and die a death of paralysis by analysis. You just did it! And, what, what, what’s in your personality, what’s in your background and your upbringing, your belief system that allows you just do it. Because that’s the magic. If I can figure it out with you, I can make a lot of difference to those people out there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @24:42\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Right. Okay. That’s deep. Hold on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I’m gonna move you center to the camera and I’m gonna move out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Are you gonna have music? Can you have music and…?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Just tell the people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: The people. Okay. First, it’s my beliefs. Because I feel that my accomplishments don’t define who I am. That who I am is, is not attached to what I do, or what I accomplish, or even the things that I fail with or fail doing. Um, that’s a first one that, that who I am matters to the one that matters most to me. Um, and so, that, to me, that’s my guiding light in life, and so that’s how I approach most situations and I’m growing (obviously I’m not perfect, but that’s…that’s my beliefs). ‘Cause I feel like we talked about thoughts influence behaviors, but even before that I believe it’s beliefs. Um, belief about who you are and why you’re here. Um, that’s the first one, it’s like the deepest! The deepest one! Uh, the second one is, I believe it is in my personality to just do things. Um, when I was sixteen, my cousin/piano teacher, he wanted me to start teaching piano and I was like, “I’m sixteen years old. I don’t even know piano that well. I’m not that great.” And, um, a lady called me two days later and she’s like, “Hey! I heard that you give piano lessons and there’s two–I have two kids I want you to teach.” And I was like, “Well, I do now.” So, I took that, that way of just accepting things as they come, like the crazy (you know) man on the Internet that I was standing next to, um, that when opportunities come to you, when things that you learn come up, that you just embrace them. Kind of like what Chris always tells us: Embrace and pivot. But you can do that in your own life. And I, I do that in my own life. I embrace what comes and then I move forward. So, if you want it at the deepest level, that’s what…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @26:42\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Aren’t you scared?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Of what?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I don’t know. Most people are afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I feel like this is weird ‘cause there’s just a voice coming in from the side! So you don’t wanna come back?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: It’s okay! Just look right there. Just pour your heart out and, right into that camera. Look right down the barrel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Say that question again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Aren’t you afraid? Like, why can you do what few people have been able to do? Besides saying, “Yeah! I just did it!” Help ‘em out!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @27:08\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Umm, there is fear there, but to me, for me, the excitement is…it overshadows the fear. And the other thing that I had mentioned to Chris before when he had asked me that, um, a big difference, too, for me this past year was, was being aware of what I’m thankful for, and that, um, what that looks like for me is sending two of my friends a gratitude list of three things I’m most thankful for every single day. Every single morning, no matter how bad our day was, no matter how bad we’re feeling, that we always send three things we’re grateful for. So one, it helps with accountability because you see that your friends are doing it, and we never bash each other if we forget, but it’s the fact that we see someone else doing it and then we do it as well. Um, the other thing is just sharing in gratitude and it changes your mind that you start actually looking for those things that you’re grateful for and that are good things instead of, um, I think are–it’s easy to get into that rut of naturally seeing what we suck at, and what went bad, and how someone treated us, and start blaming things, or people for what our life is right now, so doing the gratitude list has–I feel like it’s changed my brain, too, over the past few months since…I believe I started that like a couple weeks after I got coached by Chris. And that, coupled with just moving forward and doing it, and so when I, when I did the first strategy session with my client, I had to do my gratitude list the next day and so instead of thinking, “Oh, that went horribly, I did this wrong, and I should have done this, that I was just thinking of all the good things that came out of it. And I thought: “Oh my gosh! My client was excited.” And, they found out this about their business. And they did this and I was able to uncover this or make this connection, and so, I’m constantly now thinking in the positive light instead of the negative. So that’s a big one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @29:03\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That’s fantastic! That’s fantastic. So, you, you…how long ago did you graduate from school?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]:Ten years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Ten years. Okay. So that means a couple of things. That means you can be pretty set in your rhythms in life for ten years and have a change like that [*snaps his fingers*]. Yet the only thing that’s stopping you is you. And that’s why I’m just so appreciative of being able to watch you grow, to see you take on things and just…you know, I’mma give myself some credit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Go for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I’m just gonna go and do one of these things [*pats himself on the back*]. I’mma, I’mma say something here, is: People always ask me: How do you determine who’s gonna be on the show? ‘Cause obviously there’s a lot of people who reach out and say, “Chris! Help us! Help us! Critique this! Help me! Coach me! Mentor me!” But you see, I, I pride myself on being able to spot talent. And talent isn’t necessarily what you guys think. Some of you guys might think, “Talent? Well, she has a giant Instagram following,” or “She’s already a design superstar.” And that’s not the case at all. What I saw in Melinda, which is very rare, is, I put out a task for people to do. The task was to draw grids over logos. And, what Melinda just exceeded my expectations in such a way that I was thinking: “Here’s a person who took a little bit of an idea, a kernel, and made it blow up.” So, this is a lesson to all of you guys that that kind of spirit is rewarded whether or not you have a mentor or not. So I think that that’s the kind of attitude that you have. Give you a little bit and you just take it and you run. Nose down, head down, and you just bash with the barriers, and I just love that. And I love that you just said that you’re really excited about the potential of what’s gonna happen, and you didn’t focus too much on what you had to lose. And that’s the key thing in life. Most people think about what they have to lose; few people think about what they have to gain. That’s what you did. Excellent job there. Okay. Now that you’re just killin’ it (Killin’ it!), what do we think, the end of 2018, what are you gonna do in terms of your gross billings? ‘Cause we had said before (at the end of 2017) you wish you could get this, and that freaked people out. They were like, “What’s she complaining about? That’s a ton of money!” Yes, relatively speaking, it is, relatively speaking, but we have goals. We set goals, we smash goals, we go to our stretch goals, so what is your goal for 2018 in terms of gross billings?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: A hundred and eighty thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Woohoo! A hundred and eighty thousand! It was a hundred before, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: It was a hundred before, until you told me to change it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I did?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Yes, you did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Shh! We’ll edit that part out. I didn’t say it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Okay. Yes! It was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: A hundred and eighty THOUSAND. Boom! Now, I have to ask you a couple of questions. Back when you were going to–what school did you go to again?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Cal State Fullerton.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Cal State Fullerton, what up?! Cal State Fullerton! Did you think, in a year, you could possibly pull down a hundred and eighty thousand? Was that part of even your idea of what you could do as a graphic designer?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: No. I’ve heard–well, in school, I did hear of people getting like hundred thousand rebrands, but that in my mind was for those top agency people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Like, it wasn’t…it wasn’t anything that I thought I could necessarily do, or…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Like, out of reach for mere mortals, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Alright, so you’re closing it. You have a killer attitude. You just, now you’re in the process of redesigning your website.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Excellent. You’re doing everything that you need to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Is there anything else that we need to talk about before we kinda get into some coaching stuff?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I wanna get into the coaching stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: You do?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Alright.

I’m catching up with—you guessed it—with Melinda, and she’s here. And she’s had some tremendous growth. So I wanna talk to her, and, without further ado: Melinda, what has been going on with your life? Last we spoke, last time we spoke…LAST TIME WE SPOKE! She was like, “Chris! All my work is gone! What did you do to me? Are you trying to ruin me or what?” And I said, “You know: Stay with the plan, follow the process. Trust me, and I’ll take care of you.” So, wonderful things have happened.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Melinda Livsey]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You are leading the charge for a bunch of designers to start to charge for their knowledge. So I wanna hear kinda where you’re at, and then I’m gonna ask you a bunch of questions about how you got to be where you’re at.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Alright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Give us the like the BIG update.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: The big update, well, last time I was here we were here with Rebecca and I was saying how all of my leads had dried up and my work, and I was probably eating Top Ramen and something, ugh…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh, hush! HUSH!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Wasting away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Top Ramen over Kobe steak! But yes!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: But now! Yes! Yes! So since then, one huge thing that’s changed are the leads. The leads are coming in. I have a lot, a lot of leads, which now (and I’ve sold jobs at a much higher price), now I have to do them, and so I’m dealing with actually—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C] New problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah, new problems! Great problems! I’m not complaining, I’m very thankful. Um, but it’s a completely different—it’s a huge shift. A huge shift that just started…I would say right after Thanksgiving, I got all the leads.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: So it does take time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It took a while.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I just want to let everybody know: It does take some time. You all expect instant results. Like, if I do X, then Y will happen immediately. And it doesn’t work like that. Real life does not work like that. It takes time to, to prepare the soil, to, to plant, and then you don’t get the harvest for some time. So let’s just get into the nitty and the gritty, if you will. The nitty-gritty, which is: You’re getting a bunch of leads now, which is fantastic (we’ll talk more about how you got those leads), but let’s talk about charging more. Let’s just dangle the carrot out there for them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@2:32\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: What do you mean that you’re charging more? Like, how much more? Where do you go from and where are you at now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @2:38\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I went from 1) not doing strategy at all (using a questionnaire as my “strategy,” I would say)…I mean, I wasn’t charging for that, and now I am charging. I’m leading with that. I’m actually selling that–I’m not really selling. I’m trying to align with my client. I don’t want to say sell because I’m not pushing anyone into anything. Um, I’m aligning with their goals and their problems, and I am offering them strategy first, really as the only option if they would like to work with me. And, um, I’m presenting it in a way that they’ve fallen in love with strategy, and then I’m charging for it. So that is a massive change from not charging for a questionnaire (which I DID call my “strategy”), to actually doing in-person workshops and selling that strategy. That’s a big difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. I think you’ve done an excellent job of avoiding my question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Well, repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: How much are you charging from–How much are you charging today relative to what you were just charging a little while ago? Can you give us an idea?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Well, it’s just completely different because the structure is different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well then, tell me about that structure and then the price attached to that structure then.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@3:48\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]:Okay. So previously, I charged zero for strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Now I charge (the last one) I’ve charged 5,000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: 5,000 bucks?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: So I went from zero…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: WOO!!!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: …to 5,000 for strategy alone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C] Okay. So that’s a big number for a lot of people to process right now and some people are like: “Well, what is strategy? Like, what do you mean you charge 5,000 and why weren’t you able to do it before?” So we’ll spend a little time talking about this part. And I think the people want to know, ‘cause this is radically different because people are struggling in the streets, wherever you’re watching this, to even get four or five hundred bucks for a logo. And that’s like WORK. You’re talking about like getting paid to think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s a good problem to have.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@4:40\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. So let’s talk a little bit about that then. Um, in terms of, What is strategy to you now? We kind of understand a little bit about what you referenced before, but, now that you’re doing it, tell the people what it is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Tell the people what it is. Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Pretend like—okay—pretend like I’m a client.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Oh, man!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Like: Ding dong! Hey, Melinda! I wanna work with you. I saw your work!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Oh, role play! Again?!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Laughter.]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You can’t avoid it!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Chris, you know how this turns out!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It turns out great every single time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah, every single time. It’s great! It, yeah…Well it’s…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: …Open to interpretation. Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, so—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I’m just a brand new client. This time it’s gonna be really easy because you’re a super pro now, so, you know: Ring, ring! Here we go.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@5:18\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I wanna work with you! I saw your website, I’ve seen you on all these podcasts, and your Instagram is amazing—I wanna work with you. How do we do that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: You wanna work with me? What are you looking for?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I’m looking to rebrand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Oh! You’re looking to rebrand. Okay. So have you thought of a certain budget? Do you have a certain budget set aside for this?\u003cbr/\u003e  \u003cbr/\u003e[C]: I don’t.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: You don’t. Well, okay. Typically, depending on the size of your company, marketing efforts are around 5% to 10%, depending on what your goal is, so, of your gross revenue, so, with that said, what’s your goal of rebranding? Why are you even…what makes you want to rebrand?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I just feel like it’s outdated, and you know, I hired some friend of the family who did it originally and it’s been okay, but we’re growing and I feel like when I look at what we do, I don’t feel proud of our identity. I’m not proud at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @6:19\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: And so, could you describe to me where you’re at currently? As far as where you want to grow? I hear you wanna grow, so that’s your ideal. And you want to continue to grow, so that’s your ideal. But you feel that you are stale or…Can you describe to me what that feeling is? Why do you feel that way about your brand?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Well, I’m gonna show you this: Does this look jenky to you? This feels like it’s not professional, it doesn’t feel like we’re innovative, it doesn’t feel like it’s reflective of what our value is. We’re an 80 million dollar company, and this looks like some kid did it, because in truth, some kid did do it. I want a professional touch. I saw the work that you do: It’s very classy, it’s very stylish, it’s very modern–that’s what I want for my company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @7:05\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Great! Well, it sounds like (from what I’m hearing) your ideal client…are they feeling the same thing that you are, too? Are you losing them? Are you gaining them?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Hmm, I don’t know. I think we would like to have more clients…We’re growing, so, I think we’re gaining clients and customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @7:25\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Well, typically during this conversation, I would have something visual to show, and I would be writing down where you are (which is here) and then I would be writing down your ideal (which is there), so that they can see it visually and we’re both looking at something together. And then I would break it down where the middle (this is your aim), so I start asking you questions: “Well, what is this…What’s an attainable goal about midway between where you are now and where you wanna be? What would that look like to you?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Well, you know, I don’t know yet. I mean, I just, really would like to start with the rebrand, so I’m thinking: we need a new logo, we need a new identity system, probably somewhere down the line, we’ll need a website to reflect all this stuff, but for right now, I think the identity is really important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @8:06\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Great, so, those are the tasks that will get us to that goal, [but] what does that goal actually look like for your company? Where is your company during that time? Is it–did your company grow in revenue? Do you want your company to grow as far as sales, as far as attracting a certain kind of customer? What does that look like? Because those things (the logo, the rebrand) are more of a vehicle to get you to the goal, or a task to get you there, but they aren’t the end goal. So they’re there to get you to your goal. So what would that look like for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Maybe I’m not understanding this: I just feel like things don’t look very good right now. And I feel like, if we could just do that, I’d be more proud to represent ourselves like, as we go out into the world. I almost feel ashamed. Like, I don’t want to even give you my business card right now. Do you know what I mean?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @8:58\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah, yeah. So then, an attainable goal that I’m hearing is that, it would be that you’re proud of your company, and that you would want to go around and that you want to be proud of it, that you want to show it off, you wanna feel that you are above your competitors. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Sounds good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @9:14\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Well, this is how I do it! (And then, you would see visually, how strategy comes into play with that.) Strategy is the core that we have to start with, the next thing are objectives (so that would be something like UX, that would be marketing funnels, that would be goals (measurable goals), from there we have deliverables. And so, if we actually start with the logo first, we’re going to have a very shell of a brand, and it’s not going to be held up by anything because there’s no goals, and there’s no purpose. So we actually start with brand strategy first. And then you would see a goal, or you would see a diagram of that if you were sitting down with me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Okay. This feels right. I feel like you’re the right person to do this. So, how much do you charge to do this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @10:00\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: So typically, brand strategy is, it starts at 5,000 and it can range all the way to 15. And you would see also what those options would be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Okay, and what do I get for that? Like, why do I have to do this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @10:11\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: It sounds like you want to get to your goal and typically my clients, which in this conversation, we would end up seeing that you’re possibly not focused, that you’re trying to do several things at once, but not getting very far, and so I have some things to walk through to show that, and usually clients are like: Yes, I totally relate to that. So with that, focus and clarity are what I’m mainly leading with, with strategy, and so the first package is strategy to find out who the ideal client is, to know them very well, to also provide a marketing funnel strategy (so the overarching funnel of how does the client become aware of you, all the way to, how do they end up  being an advocate for your company)? Because you want people to share and re-feed the funnel so that you don’t have to keep putting money in. So does that sound good? Put money back in to gain those ideal clients if they’re your advocates?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That sounds great.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @11:09\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: And we would also go over your brand, too, and who you are so that what you said about wanting to be confident in your brand and be able to feel like you’re above the competition, we would also nail down all the attributes, the positioning statement, the value proposition, in that early time so that we know where we’re going and you know where you’re going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e@11:30\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: That sounds all wonderful, but I just want you to do our identity. Can we just skip this process?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e  @11:36\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Well, do you have a brand strategy already?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I have something, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: You have something? And what does that entail?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Uh, I can send it to you after this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @11:51\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Maybe I can kinda share with you what we have. It has a little bit about our mission statement, what some of our beliefs are…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @11:53\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Okay. That more stands for something that is aligned with your business plan, and this is more aligned with how you reach your ideal client. So they’re a little bit different. And I work through this certain process, so if you’d like to work with me, then we do start at brand strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @12:12\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: So you’re saying you won’t do this unless we hire you to do the brand strategy?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @12:17\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: That’s correct because I feel that I’ve actually used to do this, I used to be a freelancer and I used to take on the projects that were the deliverables, and I didn’t even think about what my clients’ goals were, and if we were reaching those goals, and if we were helping the client get to those goals, and it was–I ended up being an expense. And I don’t want to do that to my clients anymore, so I have switched over to the world of brand strategy because I want to align with my clients’ goals, and then have them align with their own clients. (So this is again, there is a diagram here where it shows “brand strategy,” “objectives,” and “deliverables.” So people typically come to me for the deliverables, but there is no goal or no strategy attached, so you don’t know if you’re reaching your goal. So then, it always ends up being an expense and not an investment.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @13:08\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Okay, you’ve given me a lot to think about here. So if this strategy part costs $5,000 dollars (and I hear a lot of people say this, so I’m not sure if y’all’s are saying the same thing), but if I have to spend 5,000 bucks, then okay. What’s the logo gonna cost me?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @13:26\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: The logo is going to cost you a minimum of 5,000 on top of the strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Okay, a minimum. Okay, what would affect the price?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: The complexity…the…(I’m breaking character.).\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You, you can’t just decide when you want to break character!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Well, yes! I can! I can!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yo! Yo! My brain can’t process like when you’re like: Is she breaking character?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@13:47\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Well I have visuals, so we’re breaking my own process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: No, we’re just having a conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I know, I don’t have this…I do visuals, yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mmm. Alright. \u2028\u2028[M]: So I go from initial…\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: I gotta coach you on how to do this without anything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Well I, I have to do it with visuals currently because I have nothing on my site to show this, at all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Well, it doesn’t matter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay, well then…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You have it up here (*points to his head*)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Do teach, Master Do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I will. I will, but let’s just finish this out though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e@14:08\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Okay. So I’m just saying this because my process that I’m currently doing, this would not happen. Because I have case studies to show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: And I have a process to show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: So.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Ah. Interesting. Okay. So, where were we? I was asking about like—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Logo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Logo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And it’s like, “What can impact the price?” And you answered that, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. Now you see, now we’re like busy arguing about something, now I can’t remember anymore! It’s like an old married couple over here! It’s like, “What are we talking about?” Okay. Alright. I think we got your role playing. I think I have some tips for you, but we’ll circle back to that later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e@14:48\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Okay. So we’ve established now that you charge 5,000 dollars to do strategy, and it really can impact the client’s business, which makes you feel good. It gets you a seat at the table so you’re not an “order taker,” you’re an advisor to the client.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Correct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And I like that you stood your ground, so if they insist that this is not going to happen, what–how do you say it? So let me get back into the role play. Don’t break character now! Stop pointing to the screen like, “At this point—“\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Well, I have to—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: No! No!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M] Because you’re breaking my process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So what?\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: I’m just! Well, if you want to—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Improvise! Improvise!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: But if you want a true example of what goes on, then…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: If you don’t…If you want something new, that’s okay. But if you really want to know what’s going on, then, this is not what’s going on!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s too much! It’s too much!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay. Go back to strategy then!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: No! We’re moving on. I don’t even know what we’re talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: We’re talking about if I don’t—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: We’re going to have to do some editing here!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: If I don’t take them on, then—\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: It’s deliverable only.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@15:45\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: So, so, get, get rid of me then. Let’s just say like: “Look, I really like you. I think I can spend 5 to 8 thousand dollars on the logo by itself, I’m just not really into this other thing. I just, I need to get this thing done, and we’ve had somebody do this before and it really got us nowhere. So, are you saying that you won’t take on this job?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Uh, see it—I would…delve into the why…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Things went bad over there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Stay in character!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: Okay. I thought you were leading me somewhere else. This is bad. See? This is…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: This is why Melinda never comes on the show! So that’s why she won’t come on the show anymore. Alright. \u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Ooooookay. Well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yes?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: That is—[Laughter.] Because I don’t feel that it would get you to your goal, that I’ll have to refer you to someone else that would take on a logo only, from the start.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Hmm, okay, that’s a bummer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I would love to work with you, though. I would, truly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I would love to get those referrals. Who are you gonna send me?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @16:49\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: I have a list. I’ll send you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Are you checking it twice?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[M]: I’ll send you right after this call. Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. End scene! We’ll, we’ll stop it right there. Okay, so let’s get back to this whole thing. Uh, I’m gonna have to teach you how to say no. I’m gonna have to teach you how to do this without visuals, and so that you can be in the flow. A lot of this (okay, you’re relatively new still, relatively speaking), so soon you’ll be able to do this kinda over the phone while you’re driving to have Starbucks. It’ll be no problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: And the initial call, which I took from you last time, was to qualify the price. So the initial one is that and then the second one is (just letting you know what I’m current doing) to get them on a Skype call or an in-person meeting if I am local. And that’s why I use visuals because I have nothing on my site. Because I lead with deliverables at the moment on my website, which is not going to be that way next month.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Good. You already know the task.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I already know. So that’s why I felt like instead of having things on my website and case studies that I’m gonna have them in-person and show them and talk them through it that…which so far has worked out for me to get to five thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @18:05\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[C]: Alright, so! I’m gonna say this because I’m gonna give voice to our audience that are watching: They’re like, “Oh, my God! I can’t believe she’s saying no to a five to eight thousand dollar logo!” How are you gonna handle that criticism? Like, what did you charge to do this, like, a year ago?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: A year ago? I was charging…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Before we met.\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: The top one, which was a branding package, was $6300.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @18:28\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: Okay, so a year ago, you were happy with $6300. And now, just a year later, if somebody’s gonna offer you five to eight thousand dollars to do a logo again, and you’re like, “Hm.” How do you speak to that? Like, what has happened to you? So spoiled so fast.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Well, those people that are complaining, now they have a client! Potentially.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That you’re gonna give them\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: That I will give them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: And why would you do that now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @18:53\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Why would I do that now? Because of the reasons that I was telling you, that, as the client, one, I know that it’s not necessarily (I don’t know this for sure, but) it’s not necessarily gonna reach their goal, and so, if everything’s not in alignment as far as strategy and their goals and we’re not getting anywhere, we’re just checking things off a list, so it’s like: “Do you wanna have–do you just wanna check something off a list or do you want to be effective?” And I (now that I’ve tasted the greatness, I wanna be effective! Because to me, that’s worth more than money. It really is.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I see. So it’s almost like you took the pill and you entered into the matrix, and now you know it’s all fake. That’s not cheeseburger that you’re eating, it’s like code, and you can’t go back. You’d rather live in the raw, dirty world that we know, rather than go back to that place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That’s interesting. Okay, so, there’s a lot of people in our group (in our pro-coaching group) who are still… (I don’t wanna use the word “struggling,” but it’s still a challenge for them to get to that place where they can charge five thousand dollars just for the thinking part. There’s only a handful. There’s about half a dozen of you guys so far that have separated out (and I know that there are a lot of people that think that, “Mmm, I charge strategy for all of that, but it’s all lumped together). So first of all, I want to say kudos to you for being able to do it, and also, kind of listening to the advice that I give you, and, a lot of people are like: “I’m doing it.” But they don’t do it the way that I tell them to do it, so then I’m like, “You’re not doing it.” Right? So some people still kind of mush it together and I don’t think they’re confident enough to separate it apart. Because once you separate it, you’re validating that there’s value there, and that they’re willing to hire you for that reason, and that’s excellent. So I have to ask you this question: What makes you so special? What makes you so different? Because I give advice out to strangers on the Internet, I give advice to the coaching group, one-on-one coaching…Why, why were you able to achieve what they weren’t able to achieve?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @20:59\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: That’s a deep question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That’s what I’m here for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I feel like it’s a simple answer though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: What is it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I just did it. I just started. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That’s helpful. [Laugher.]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @21:10\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: Well, it is to those who are stalled. Just do the first small, very small step. Whatever that is. For me, it was: Learn how to do strategy. The second one, it was: Get someone to agree to let me do strategy for them for their company. One of them was my cousin! One of them was my good friend/client that I have worked with before. Uhh, another one was a previous client. Um, someone else was a friend, and, yeah, I think one other was a previous client as well, so, a lot of them were friends, they were family members, they were previous clients, that I felt comfortable with, and they agreed to, to let me do strategy for them. And with every single one of those, I got more confident with it. And then I realized, “Oh my gosh! There’s magic in this!” Like I, I was converted after that!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: The skies parted and this ray of light came and you’re like, “Oh, it’s so warm in the sunlight!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @22:08\u2028\u003cbr/\u003e[M]: But it really came–It came after every single strategy that I did for someone, I saw the difference that it made or the lightbulb that came on with them and the clarity that they had, and then I thought, “Oh my gosh! If this happened with the first person, just think about what will happen with the next, and the next! And, every time I did it, yeah! I got better, I changed my strategy document and my process as I went ‘cause I was seeing the needs, or I saw the roadblocks, or what was not necessary. Or where things got confusing and I straightened those out and, every time…Every time I do strategy now, I add something or I take something away because of what I’ve done previously, and now I’m…I feel confident in what I’m charging and I feel confident in even raising my prices because I see the impact that it’s making on the businesses that I’ve already worked with–and the people! It’s not just the business, it’s the (like, I had one client–and she’s the one that was my friend, she said, “You’re the only one that I feel got, who understands my vision.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Mmm. Did she give you a hug?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Pretty much, yeah. She did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Did she cry?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Uh, I don’t know about crying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Alright. I’m gonna get you to “Do” status where they start crying and huggin’ you. Like, “Oh my God! You’re so good!” Alright, this is good. ‘Cause it can be cathartic. I just wanna say that. “Cathartic.” And we’ll put the definition right there: “cathartic.” Okay, so, you did a great job of explaining something, but you didn’t answer my question. I wanna get into your mind. I wanna crawl into this brain and say like, there’s some random dude that you saw on the Internet. And you come in, and you chat with me a couple of times, a little bit of coaching and I told you that you’re not doing strategy. And, you took it like a champ. You got like an iron chin because I smacked you and you were like, “Yeah, what else you got?” I’m like, “Oh, I got more.” And then, you get into the core framework, and you quietly go off and do your thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @24:03\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[C]: It is a special somebody that can just take a little bit of information and even though it’s counter to everything that they’ve done before that moment, yet you’re willing to just move forward without sitting there and thinking, over-analyzing, over-thinking, and die a death of paralysis by analysis. You just did it! And, what, what, what’s in your personality, what’s in your background and your upbringing, your belief system that allows you just do it. Because that’s the magic. If I can figure it out with you, I can make a lot of difference to those people out there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @24:42\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Right. Okay. That’s deep. Hold on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I’m gonna move you center to the camera and I’m gonna move out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Are you gonna have music? Can you have music and…?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Just tell the people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: The people. Okay. First, it’s my beliefs. Because I feel that my accomplishments don’t define who I am. That who I am is, is not attached to what I do, or what I accomplish, or even the things that I fail with or fail doing. Um, that’s a first one that, that who I am matters to the one that matters most to me. Um, and so, that, to me, that’s my guiding light in life, and so that’s how I approach most situations and I’m growing (obviously I’m not perfect, but that’s…that’s my beliefs). ‘Cause I feel like we talked about thoughts influence behaviors, but even before that I believe it’s beliefs. Um, belief about who you are and why you’re here. Um, that’s the first one, it’s like the deepest! The deepest one! Uh, the second one is, I believe it is in my personality to just do things. Um, when I was sixteen, my cousin/piano teacher, he wanted me to start teaching piano and I was like, “I’m sixteen years old. I don’t even know piano that well. I’m not that great.” And, um, a lady called me two days later and she’s like, “Hey! I heard that you give piano lessons and there’s two–I have two kids I want you to teach.” And I was like, “Well, I do now.” So, I took that, that way of just accepting things as they come, like the crazy (you know) man on the Internet that I was standing next to, um, that when opportunities come to you, when things that you learn come up, that you just embrace them. Kind of like what Chris always tells us: Embrace and pivot. But you can do that in your own life. And I, I do that in my own life. I embrace what comes and then I move forward. So, if you want it at the deepest level, that’s what…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @26:42\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Aren’t you scared?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Of what?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I don’t know. Most people are afraid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I feel like this is weird ‘cause there’s just a voice coming in from the side! So you don’t wanna come back?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: It’s okay! Just look right there. Just pour your heart out and, right into that camera. Look right down the barrel.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Say that question again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Aren’t you afraid? Like, why can you do what few people have been able to do? Besides saying, “Yeah! I just did it!” Help ‘em out!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @27:08\u003cbr/\u003e\u2028[M]: Umm, there is fear there, but to me, for me, the excitement is…it overshadows the fear. And the other thing that I had mentioned to Chris before when he had asked me that, um, a big difference, too, for me this past year was, was being aware of what I’m thankful for, and that, um, what that looks like for me is sending two of my friends a gratitude list of three things I’m most thankful for every single day. Every single morning, no matter how bad our day was, no matter how bad we’re feeling, that we always send three things we’re grateful for. So one, it helps with accountability because you see that your friends are doing it, and we never bash each other if we forget, but it’s the fact that we see someone else doing it and then we do it as well. Um, the other thing is just sharing in gratitude and it changes your mind that you start actually looking for those things that you’re grateful for and that are good things instead of, um, I think are–it’s easy to get into that rut of naturally seeing what we suck at, and what went bad, and how someone treated us, and start blaming things, or people for what our life is right now, so doing the gratitude list has–I feel like it’s changed my brain, too, over the past few months since…I believe I started that like a couple weeks after I got coached by Chris. And that, coupled with just moving forward and doing it, and so when I, when I did the first strategy session with my client, I had to do my gratitude list the next day and so instead of thinking, “Oh, that went horribly, I did this wrong, and I should have done this, that I was just thinking of all the good things that came out of it. And I thought: “Oh my gosh! My client was excited.” And, they found out this about their business. And they did this and I was able to uncover this or make this connection, and so, I’m constantly now thinking in the positive light instead of the negative. So that’s a big one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e @29:03\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: That’s fantastic! That’s fantastic. So, you, you…how long ago did you graduate from school?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]:Ten years.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Ten years. Okay. So that means a couple of things. That means you can be pretty set in your rhythms in life for ten years and have a change like that [*snaps his fingers*]. Yet the only thing that’s stopping you is you. And that’s why I’m just so appreciative of being able to watch you grow, to see you take on things and just…you know, I’mma give myself some credit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Go for it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I’m just gonna go and do one of these things [*pats himself on the back*]. I’mma, I’mma say something here, is: People always ask me: How do you determine who’s gonna be on the show? ‘Cause obviously there’s a lot of people who reach out and say, “Chris! Help us! Help us! Critique this! Help me! Coach me! Mentor me!” But you see, I, I pride myself on being able to spot talent. And talent isn’t necessarily what you guys think. Some of you guys might think, “Talent? Well, she has a giant Instagram following,” or “She’s already a design superstar.” And that’s not the case at all. What I saw in Melinda, which is very rare, is, I put out a task for people to do. The task was to draw grids over logos. And, what Melinda just exceeded my expectations in such a way that I was thinking: “Here’s a person who took a little bit of an idea, a kernel, and made it blow up.” So, this is a lesson to all of you guys that that kind of spirit is rewarded whether or not you have a mentor or not. So I think that that’s the kind of attitude that you have. Give you a little bit and you just take it and you run. Nose down, head down, and you just bash with the barriers, and I just love that. And I love that you just said that you’re really excited about the potential of what’s gonna happen, and you didn’t focus too much on what you had to lose. And that’s the key thing in life. Most people think about what they have to lose; few people think about what they have to gain. That’s what you did. Excellent job there. Okay. Now that you’re just killin’ it (Killin’ it!), what do we think, the end of 2018, what are you gonna do in terms of your gross billings? ‘Cause we had said before (at the end of 2017) you wish you could get this, and that freaked people out. They were like, “What’s she complaining about? That’s a ton of money!” Yes, relatively speaking, it is, relatively speaking, but we have goals. We set goals, we smash goals, we go to our stretch goals, so what is your goal for 2018 in terms of gross billings?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: A hundred and eighty thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Woohoo! A hundred and eighty thousand! It was a hundred before, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: It was a hundred before, until you told me to change it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: I did?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Yes, you did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Shh! We’ll edit that part out. I didn’t say it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Okay. Yes! It was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: A hundred and eighty THOUSAND. Boom! Now, I have to ask you a couple of questions. Back when you were going to–what school did you go to again?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Cal State Fullerton.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Cal State Fullerton, what up?! Cal State Fullerton! Did you think, in a year, you could possibly pull down a hundred and eighty thousand? Was that part of even your idea of what you could do as a graphic designer?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: No. I’ve heard–well, in school, I did hear of people getting like hundred thousand rebrands, but that in my mind was for those top agency people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Like, it wasn’t…it wasn’t anything that I thought I could necessarily do, or…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Like, out of reach for mere mortals, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Alright, so you’re closing it. You have a killer attitude. You just, now you’re in the process of redesigning your website.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Excellent. You’re doing everything that you need to do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Thank you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Is there anything else that we need to talk about before we kinda get into some coaching stuff?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: I wanna get into the coaching stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: You do?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [M]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e [C]: Alright.

We are live today on Facebook and Youtube! Hello, beautiful people! What are we going to be talking about today? Well, before I tell you, I just want to let you guys know I miss ya and I hope you missed us, and here we are back on the livestream. But! Back by popular demand, today we are going to be talking to Aaron Atchinson, he’s the founder of Farm Design based in Pasadena, and he is one of–he’s a man who has come from humble roots. Humble beginnings, and that’s his description, not mine. Now often times when we look at successful graphic designers and successful businesses, we make the assumption that it was preordained. That everything lined up for them and that that path was inevitable. This was most definitely not the case, so you guys are gonna want to definitely stay tuned to this because we’re gonna have a conversation with Aaron. He grew up in a town of 300 people. Small town. Stick around! Roll the titles!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[RAW Titles]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:36\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright, we’re back. Now you guys noticed I’m not in the black box. I’m sitting next to my good friend, and we are good friends. We’ve known each other for, I think somewhere close to 20 years if not longer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Aaron Atchinson]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s been awhile. It’s been awhile, so, there’s a familiarity here, and I’ve been prodding and pulling and pushing and hoping and begging for Aaron to come on the show and do it live with us, and he finally agreed, so lots of things have changed in his life, but before we do that, let’s tell everybody who you are and let’s get back and rewind the tape if you will, let’s cut to my deck.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@2:08\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: This is Aaron Atchison, and he is the Founder of Farm Design. And if you guys want to look him up, what’s the web address?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: FarmDesign.net\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Man, you sound good in that mic. Dang! Alright, anyways, you grew up in a small town called “Geraldine, Montana.” Tell me about Geraldine. What do you remember growing up there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Geraldine, Montana is in the central part of Montana, it’s a rural community, a farming community, a town (at that time, the population was 300–it’s actually, probably, maybe, far less than that now), but it was a lot of agriculture, um, built around community and the high school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah. So there are–we have a picture of you, your brother, and your dad, you sitting on a boat in a lake somewhere, you shoveling something. What is, what are you shoveling there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That would be grain in a grain silo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s how much I don’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: A grain silo. Do you have any horror stories about the grain silo?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: In the grain silo?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Normally when you hop in those things, there’s like a ton of mice running around in there and, and I don’t like mice, so, you know, so we normally let the dogs in first and the dogs sort of scare all of the mice out and then we hop in there. That’s my horror story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, so as I mentioned, you grew up in a town of 300 people, high school population of…?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: The high school, 50 kids and my graduating class had 11 kids, but we had an exchange student, so, I would say, pretty much we had 10 from the time I moved there from when I was in 5th grade ‘till the time I graduated. So it was the same (basically), the same 10 students.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, so, you go to high school and then you graduate. What did you study in school at Montana State?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I always wanted to be either a baker or an architect growing up. There was something–fascination I had with baking. I like baking pancakes in the morning, but I chose to become an architect so I went to Montana State University, which is in Bozeman, Montana, um, to study architecture initially.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And, how does one who studies architecture at Montana State wind up in California doing graphic design?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That’s interesting. I was actually born in Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh! You were?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So my brother, who’s a year older than myself, we were both born and raised in California. Uh, my mom was really young when she had two of us. Later I found out in life that she, she was 16 years old when she had two boys.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Wow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So, we actually moved around quite a bit as kids ‘cause my mom was trying to figure out where her path was and trying to just survive, and trying to figure out how to raise two young boys. So we moved around a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, we ultimately ended up (um, what I consider my hometown, which is in Montana). So we bounced around a lot, and we settled there when I was about ten years old.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah. So, um, she met a gentleman and they got married. His name is Larry Atchison, so I took on his last name.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, but yeah, I think a lot of my, sort of, experiences in life, I refer back to that time that I lived when I was in Montana.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Because I think I learned a lot of, like, discipline and a lot of the qualities that I sort of, I can attribute to growing up there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@5:14\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uh-hm. It must have been tough for you growing up because you, your mom was like in her teens…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And I imagine that there wasn’t a lot of money. You’ve told me stories about you actually having to go outside to go to the bathroom in what is referred to as an “outhouse.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@5:26\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It’s still called an “outhouse.” Yes, but, we–I…one point we lived in a house where we didn’t have running water. And so, when you don’t have running water, you don’t have plumbing, and so we had an outhouse that you had to walk (I think it was maybe a hundred yards away). Which was terrible when it was snowing because then you always, like, in the middle of the night, you have to go to the bathroom. You have to go to the bathroom and then you throw on your sneakers and your hoodie and you run out through the snow but, yeah, it was–it was tough, but you know, when you’re a kid you don’t, you don’t think about those things. It’s just, it’s just the fact of life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Do you have any horror stories?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Horror stories?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: About going to the bathroom and there’s a raccoon?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Oh gosh, no. Nothing quite like that. I always feared there was something actually in the outhouse. Like, you know, but nothing. Nothing like that. So I–fortunately no horror stories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Like there wasn’t a pennywise holding a red balloon in a hole and saying, “Come here!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: No?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No. Not in the country. Yeah, clowns are smarter than that. They don’t move out in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: They only hang out in suburban neighborhoods under the city. Okay, luckily for you. What–I mean, I can’t even fathom this. Look, I grew up kind of poor, too, but just not even having running water…how do you wash your hands and what does it even, how does it even work?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@6:38\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, wow. There was actually a creek, and the creek was maybe 300 yards away, and so part of growing up is my brother and I, we always had chores, and the first thing I had to do waking up in the morning was start the fire, ‘cause we didn’t have heating. We didn’t have centralized heating so, we had to like chop wood and we had to start the fire to heat the house up. So I had to wake up at (I think around) 6:30, start the fire, that was my responsibility, and then to get water, we had these um, buckets (and I think they were maybe like 3 or 4 pound buckets), and I at the time probably weighed 70 pounds soaking wet, so I was, I was tiny. And then we had to go out to the creek, then we’d have to–a little pull, and we’d pull it up, and we’d carry it back to the house so–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: A lot of hard work!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Boil water and, um, if you’ve ever seen “Hee-Haw” (which I’m kind of dating myself), like, there are scenes in there where they would bathe and they were sitting there in like a big, um, stainless steel, um, bucket, and they’re bathing themselves with a ladle. That’s how we literally bathed. And we didn’t do it all the time because it was, it took a lot of effort, so, um, we, oftentimes we bathed once a week. It was very challenging! But it was, it was just the way of life! And it was like, you didn’t know any different. It was, it was actually pretty cool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@7:55\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It sounds a little bit like now from thinking about it, it sounds like camping. So for the first part of your life, you were just camping all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: We were, yeah. We were always camping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C] Was it fun?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was a lot of fun! You know, it was uh, ‘cause there was a creek that ran out in front of a house that we lived in and we’d go out and we would go fishing and we’d bring the fish back in and that what we’d have for dinner. And we’d cook it right then and there. Um, so, yeah. And you were outside a lot and there’s animals, and I’m an animal person, so we had horses and cows and dogs and yeah, it was just, being outside and exploring. When you’re a kid, you’re just constantly, you’re curious and you’re exploring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@8:31\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. Let’s get you to California. And we’re gonna speed up the timeline here a little bit because I really do want to get into some of the mindset stuff that we’re going to talk about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@8:38\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You’re in California now, what brings you out to California?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@8:42\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: You know, okay, so, I went to Montana State University initially to study architecture. Um, I still had family here in California so, um, during the summers I would normally go and visit them and um, they would take us to like Disneyland and uh, then I was introduced to surfing, so, during the summers I would surf as much as possible. Um, but I really made the big transition when I discovered–at the time I didn’t know what it was called, but it was graphic design. Graphic design I had no idea what it was, I didn’t really know what a logo was, um, growing up in the country, they’re just, you’re not exposed to a lot of media.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, so when I was at the university, there was like these, some wacky kids, uh, at a department next to the architecture department, and they were doing some wacky stuff, and they were putting stuff on the walls, and I’d walk past their, um, their uh, studio space and I’d poke my head in and one day they were painting pizza boxes and it really piqued my interest. I’m like, “What are they painting pizza boxes for?” I walked in there and they were telling me they were designing logos and boxes, so I wanted to learn more, and it sparked my interest because I liked the simplicity and how impactful a logo and packaging could be. So that sort of led me to my next career path as um, or, in school rather is, I decided I’m going to move to California, change majors, mainly so I can surf in California, and then I, uh, I went to Cal State University, Northridge, uh, where I studied art with an emphasis in graphic design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@10:17\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Now, I’m going to spare you guys all the kind of details but, you started out in, in your home studio doing design and you’ve been doing that for quite some time. Now you and I met under kind of strange circumstances. I’m gonna let the guys know out in the audience here. We met through a mutual friend, a former employee of mine who said like, “I know you love to play Halo, Chris, so come and I’m gonna bring my buddy in. “And I know you’re a super competitive guy, I won’t get into all the juicy details, but we would all bring our X-Boxes together and, and do a LAN party and play Halo together. And that’s really how I got to know you. And I remember, there’s a couple times we wanted to play, so I would just grab my X-Box and go meet you up at your house and we’d plug the things in. I–we would go into one room and we’d have these LAN parties and just do battle for lunch and unplug and just run back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And I didn’t know you that well at the time. You were just that guy in the other room that I just wanted to kill. And so Halo is like one of those sports like–and you were probably equally as competitive. And so, I would come visit my friend and I would come to your office and you guys would actually print out sort of like…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Floorplans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Floorplans of the maps of Halo and you guys were strategizing. You had like rulers and lines, like you’d go here and here. I’m like, “This guy is intense.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Isn’t that how everybody plays Halo?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No, just you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: We weren’t going to lose, so that’s really how we got our start, but as our kind of casual friendship built up around gaming and just competing, and then I started to learn more about you and your design practice, and I’m gonna get you guys to 2008 a little bit right now. Okay? So let’s look at 2008. This is the studio in which you worked out of?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, I…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Talk to us about this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@11: 56\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, just, uh, after I graduated college, um, I got a job as a creative director at a small agency in Culver City, here in Los Angeles. So I worked there for 5 years. Um, I sort of cut my teeth sort of learning the principles of design, and working with clients, and, uh, working with vendors. I, I learned a lot. It was, it was uh, a fantastic experience in my life. In 2000 I decided I was gonna, I was gonna branch out and I was gonna do my own thing and so I had a spare bedroom in my apartment, um, and so I converted that spare bedroom into my studio, if you will, and really it was just a computer on a desk. Um, I, I was, I had enough confidence in my ability and skill level and I had some relationships and I had some small clients, so I’m like: “Okay, I’m going to take that leap of faith.” I had a little bit of money in the bank account (I think, uh, at that time, I had literally 9,000 dollars in my account), so I said–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was pretty good! I figured that I could live without any income coming in for three months and so I kind of had a time scale, like, “Okay, if this is going to happen, I, I gotta make it happen in three months.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And how old are you at this point? Do you remember?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, I was exactly 30. It was on my 30th birthday, I’m like, “I’m leaving.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Wow. Okay. And what year is this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was 2000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh, 2000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: 2000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Well, interesting. Alright, I’m trying to map your timeline, as to kind of, well…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I took the 7-year plan in, in college if you’re doing the math. But, yeah…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@13:23\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, let’s look at some of the work. So it makes sense to hear your story about your love of surfing and outdoors and just be, you’re kind of into sports and you’re an athlete and competition, and this is kind of…\u003cbr/\u003e[A] Yeah, that’s where my passion was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385c3cdbce3e_AaronAtchison_work1.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, this is a time capsule into kind of the work that you were doing. And I remember talking to you at this point in time, and, I’m going to tell a little story you guys. So here’s my, here’s my story. I’m over at Aaron’s house and he’s showing me the work that he’s doing and he’s talking about doing work with new clients, and I remember you were showing me this very ornate packaging you were putting together. I remember this, and you were going to ship this to whatever, or self-promo pieces, and I had asked you at this time, “Aaron, why don’t you get an intern in here to do this? There’s somebody else that could be doing this while you do the high-level stuff.” And I remember your response. Do you remember it, or should I tell this part?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, I didn’t listen to you much back then, so, you were my mortal enemy, so, no.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: How am I your–?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Refresh my memory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Hold on. How am I your mortal enemy?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I do remember you telling me I should do a lot of things to improve what I, my practice, right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Basically it was me giving you valuable advice that just hit you like a rock and fell on the floor, at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Pretty much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@14:33\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Your response to me was: “Hey, Chris. If I don’t do this, what else am I going to be doing? And, I don’t know, I’m just a simple guy, I just want to do the work, I see something that needs to get done and I just do it. Why would I hire anybody else to do this? What else am I gonna do?” And I remember telling you, “Well, you should be working on your business and not in your business. Be thinking about how to grow and scale.” And do you remember that now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I do remember and I think a lot of those, um, the way I was brought up growing up on a farm is like you’d…work had to be done, you just rolled, rolled your sleeves up and you got out there and you did the work. And so, when I started my practice, I still had that sort of mindset where things had to be done (I knew how to do them), and so I just rolled my sleeves up and did it. You were always, you were always sort of, kind of like that uncle that always wanted to like give me advice and I, I think I was pretty stubborn back then (still a little stubborn).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I just want to say for the record: A younger uncle, please.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Perhaps, perhaps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Don’t paint me into that picture. Just a younger uncle. The younger, cooler uncle. Keep going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: But when you said, uh, back when I first started my practice and you saw me sort of doing all these little, little tasks when you said, “You need, you should outsource that, or you should get someone to help you.” Uh, for me, I was not afraid of hard work, so I kinda didn’t understand your principles. I also was always concerned that I would be giving away something…um, I always wanted to be close to my craft, and I always, I love designing and having my hands on things and working, so, for me it’s like it didn’t feel like work so it didn’t feel like I was, I needed to give away anything. I wasn’t that busy all the time anyway, and I think that to your point is, so, it’s like, “Well I have the extra time and if I didn’t have extra time, I would just stay up later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So that was always just, that was my mentality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, so some people are guessing correctly how old Aaron is. I’m not going to tell you, but you can do the math. Now, I remember also talking to you because you would work really hard, and I’m, I would never accuse you of not working hard, but maybe I would accuse you of not working as smart as you need to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And I remember then, for periods of time you would just disappear. You would disappear and go surfing in Costa Rica, and you’d go on these epic adventures, meanwhile I was toiling away kind of in the factory, if you will. I remember saying this to you one time, I was like: “Aaron, I think you suffer from ‘Peter Pan’ syndrome. Like, you never want to grow up. You’re still doing projects–” (now, we’re in our 40s at this point, I think).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No, we’re in our late thirties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Late thirties?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Careful, we were in our thirties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: We’re in our late thirties, and I was telling you, “Like, you work on projects that I think 18, 19, 22-year-old kids would love to work on.” Uh, action, sports-oriented things and brands, and I remember you working on certain events that was kind of like–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Like X-Games type of stuff. Yeah, absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And, the other part to it was not only just reflected in the clients that you were working with and the things that connected and resonated with you, but, this idea that you would work and then you would disappear. You would just plan these trips and you would just disappear, and, and, and you liked the idea that you could pick up and go wherever you wanted, kind of in this more “transitory-transient” lifestyle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And, I said to you, “One day, when you want to focus on your business, your life will change and it will change for the better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And what was your thought?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think that my thought process during those, those years–I think–and it was right around from 2000 and 2008 was when I was a solo, solo designer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: “Solopreneur.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@18:02\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: “Solopreneur,” sort of working out my, my, my practice out of my home. My, my philosophy at the time was: I have skill and I’m willing to work hard, and, I had a certain level of success early on. I had certain clients and I would look at the bank account and I’d see the money coming in and, and it was pretty decent. You know? It was anywhere between 50 thousand to 90 thousand–was probably one of my best years. So that’s where the range was, and for me that was really good. And so I had this philosophy: I’m gonna–as long as I’m hitting a certain number, then whatever time I have leftover, I’m gonna experience things in life. So I would travel, um, so yeah. It was very much sort of a, sort of a “fixed” mindset. I wasn’t looking at [the] “big picture,” I was sort of “living in the now,” and I would look at your career and I saw you working so hard, like, always working, and I was the antithesis of that. I’m like, “Chris, why aren’t you enjoying life? Have you ever traveled out of the country?” And you were like, “There will be a time for that.” And I thought you were crazy. I’m like, “I’m not gonna be young for the rest of my life. I want to experience these things while I can still move.” And, so that was my philosophy. So–and it worked for me for a while, you know? I was like, I was getting clients, the money was okay, I was able to support myself. Um…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: But before we get into that, I want to dwell on this for a little bit because the reason why–and some of you guys that are tuning in or watching this later will realize really quickly–the reason why I brought Aaron on the show was because he can speak to and relate to so many things that you guys think. So here we are: We’re two contrasting personalities. You, you come–we’re both, we, we came out of the world kinda poor, and we worked our way out of it, but you came from a really small town, some financial hardships, and some, some family life that was less than ideal, but you worked through all that stuff, right? You made it work, and–but there was this idea of you just wanting to be (this is where we differ) this “solopreneur,” doing the work yourself and doing it all by yourself, and having great pride in being able to do it, and then saying, “What’s wrong with you? Why don’t you want to enjoy your life and I can’t see that. You’re like probably just grinding away at the, in the salt mine, kind of in the cubicle, if you will,” even though I didn’t work in a cubicle. And on the flipside, I’m over here thinking, “This guy has so much potential. He could do so many things but he just needs to learn to grow up at some point in his life.” And I’m just using it in the broadest sense, like, you’re a mature person, but I was just thinking: “Why doesn’t your work evolve? Like, my work doesn’t look the same as it did just a few years ago, let alone when I was in my 20s. I needed to do work that was going to be appealing to companies that could afford to pay me what I wanted to be paid.” I just want to get a little bit of your mindset. How you viewed yourself versus me and just, this is your opportunity to just dog on me if you want (at that point in time).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@21:01\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah. I, I think…I, I think a lot of my motivation was: “I’m just gonna work hard.” And that’s where it came from my childhood and growing up on a farm, it was like, “That’s gonna get me through tough times. It’s like, just the solution is just to work really hard.” And, and I did–I wasn’t looking very, sort of, proactively, like, “What’s gonna happen long-term?” Uh, because I had a certain level of success early on, um, branching out as a solopreneur, I thought that was it, like, it was just things were gonna happen and materialize and it was just gonna happen. I was just a lot of–a lot of things were very reactive, um, where the clients came in, um, and how I adjusted with those clients, but, it wasn’t until, you know, I fell on some hardships where it made me sort of reanalyze who I was as a person, uh, especially at that time in my life where, uh, now I’m in my late 30s, I, I expected a, you know, a certain level of success and, and comfort, and, you know, having stability and um, finances, stability in sort of my relationships and really, I started to uncover that I didn’t have a lot of these things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And that’s when there was that, that “oh crap” moment, and um, that sort of come-to-Jesus, like, “Uh, maybe I do need to grow up.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@22:14\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well let’s talk about that. So this is where I think we wanted to kind of pivot and we can circle back, you guys, if you want to ask those question on Facebook and on YouTube that we have two guys in the other room, along with Erica, Emmanuel, and Sam (two interns joining us here). So they’ll be monitoring your comments and you guys lets me know if you hear a really good question, okay? Feel free, feel free to interrupt us. Let’s talk about this point of, of change in your life. What happened here? So, I think if you guys were paying attention, if you were alive during this time in 2008, basically the, the bottom of the universe opened up as far as it’s concerned with the financial market. People were committing suicide, stocks (like Apple stock was like at 18 dollars a share), everybody thought the total economy was going to collapse and it impacted so many businesses (ours, too). And so let’s, let’s talk a little bit about 2018, uh 2008.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@23:02\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, so I think my, my business and myself was really just kind of on cruise-control, and things were fine, you know, there was money in the bank and, um, I was living the life I wanted to live. I had a lifestyle that I enjoyed, and then I think it was around 2007 is when the, the housing market sort of burst and the stock market went kind of, kind of went bonkers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: The subprime…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Right? And what happened is, clients, the phone stopped ringing, and that was when, um, I saw the bank account starting to dwindle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: How much was in the bank account at this point in time?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: You know, I, I think I was always right around anywhere from 5 to 20 thousand dollars?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And–but that was fine when money was continually coming through, but then once the phone stopped ringing, uh, I had to re-evaluate what was happening. Um, I think a lot of my clients, uh, they would keep the work in-house now because their marketing budgets were a lot tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Uh, companies or start-ups who were thinking about bringing something to market, they didn’t have that luxury anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: They didn’t have financing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Banks didn’t loan any money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, and so there was just, absolutely nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, money dried up all over the place and I think I remember, too, two of your bigger clients in the action-sports space, they had problems financially, too, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, I think, uh, in the action-sports industry, I did a lot of, um, lifestyle brands, um, action-sports and their sponsors stopped sponsoring the events, and so, those events just, they just disappeared. Another big client I had at the time I had a retainer with (Honda motorcycles), and so retainer is they, they had a one-year contract and I would get paid monthly, so it was kinda like a salary, so it was that stability. Um, they stopped having work because they then tightened-up their budget and kept everything in-house, and so then that was that moment where I needed to figure out what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@25:01\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well this kind of stuff doesn’t happen overnight. There’s a slow progression or, it might feel like it happens overnight, but–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It felt like it happened overnight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right. Like, one client calls you and says, “Aaron, it’s been great working with you, but we can’t do this anymore.” There goes Honda. The action sports guys say, “We can’t do the next event this year, all our sponsors pulled out.” And, slowly but surely you start to see that 20 thousand become 18, becomes 12, becomes 8…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And so talk to me. When did it hit rock bottom for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It, it was pretty quick. Um, I knew that (I mean), I probably started living beyond my means (‘cause I had a nice car)–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@25:37\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And I, I was more concerned about status and what people thought of me, so I, I kind of was–had a certain lifestyle that I was used to living. Eating out, dressing a certain way, um, and so when I couldn’t afford to do those things, and the money wasn’t coming in, that’s when I’m like: “Okay, what do I do now? Do I, do I actually brush off my résumé and look for another job?” And I had a lot of pride because I sort of had a certain level of success with Farm Design and, um, I’d built something. To feel like I had to let that go and, you know, suck up my pride and go on interviews again, it was really tough. And I actually did that. I had to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You, you put together your resume.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I put together my portfolio, I put–uh, I rewrote my résumé, um, this is my late 30s now and I was going to, I went to a couple job interviews and I never got the work. I’m like, “Wait, wait a minute. I thought my stuff was pretty good.” But, they weren’t hiring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Why do you think that was?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think everyone was starving. Everyone was hungry, everyone was looking for work. Uh, they had to be über selective about who they picked because, you know, they probably had limited resources as well and maybe I just didn’t fit. I think also maybe my portfolio was very one-dimensional, but that worked for me in terms of my business model. I focused heavily on, uh, an action-sports sort of “youth-lifestyle” sort of. That’s who I appealed to, those are the type of clients I appealed to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: How did that make you feel?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@27:13\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Uh, pretty inferior, actually. Um, it, it, it made me think and it kept me up late at night, uh, just wondering like okay, what did I do wrong? Um, you know. The fear of, “Can I make my car payment? Can I, can I pay for rent? What is my girlfriend gonna think?” It’s, it’s those sort of things, like, it can emasculate you, so, yeah. I think, you know, I–that was the time when I like, really hit rock bottom. It wasn’t fun. It was scary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I can, I can only imagine. I mean, even the act of putting together your résumé, not as a design exercise, but because you actually have to go out and get work, that just must have been hard to say, like, “Okay, it was a good run. It’s been 8 or so years and it’s been great, and now I have to change and everything is changing and…did you start to regret some of the decisions that you made prior to that point? Because sometimes when you’re in that dark place–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: –you ask, “Why did I buy that expensive car? What, why did I not take that opportunity, or there was that one client that I could have done something different from but I walked away ‘cause I was too or what. I don’t know what it was. I’m just…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, I don’t think I regretted the decisions I made with my business. I, I look back at it as a learning experience, like, “Okay, I probably should have done something different. Um, I, I certainly (I think with a lot of people) lived beyond my means.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, having a nice car and living a certain way, and at the end of the day, what does that all really mean? It’s, it’s superficial. And it took sort of hitting that rock-bottom to start to see those things, and re-evaluate and, um, assess who I was and, and if I needed to change my mindset to sort of right the ship because everything was, like, the business, the accounting, the–my relationships, it was like, it all kind of like came to a head.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Did it cause friction in your relationship?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It certainly didn’t help. Yeah. Um, because we split all of the–at the time, I was in a long relationship as well, and I think I wasn’t–probably it was a 15-year relationship\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And so, why didn’t I commit to that person, so I think there was a lot of things I didn’t want to grow up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So, you know, that whole “Peter Pan” syndrome thing. It, it affected everything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: If the label fits you well. I know you resented me even throwing that at you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I didn’t even know what that meant when you brought it up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I made it up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Peter Pan. Peter Pan never grows up!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That was me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Wow, okay, so if you guys want to get the razor blades out, now would be a good time to actually put them away ‘cause we’re gonna, we’re gonna pivot. There’s a reason why Aaron is here. I wanted him, and I’ve encouraged him to just kind of open his heart and share some of the pain points there because what happens next, I think we can learn a lot from. Now if we had a commercial break, this is when I would cut to a commercial break, but we don’t, so we’re gonna keep going!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s how we roll. Okay, so I’m gonna bring up this slide here, and I remember you doing this (I have my thoughts and opinions on this as well), but you started another business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Let me, let me just set the stage and then you, you take it from there. So, so here you are, you can’t get clients because you actually didn’t build a sales pipeline or sales or marketing strategy and all the things that you had done in the past, are no longer applicable because there are too many buyers and too few sellers. Oh, I’m sorry, let me say that the opposite: There are too few buyers and too many sellers of work, and so, you went out and tried to get a job. You did the whole resume dog-and-pony show and you weren’t able to get the work either, so now it’s like, what does a person do? And you got pushed into a pretty tight corner. This is when you started a company called “Mugo,” a portable MP3 music player–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: –that was kind of tapping into a big trend, and the trend was custom-vinyl-artwork, built around artists that have a following. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Take it away from there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@31:03\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, I, I think when I, when I was at that place in my career, I…I, I had to make a decision: Do I just bury my head in the sand and just, you know, did I fail or do I try to learn from my mistakes and do something with it? And when the opportunities weren’t knocking, they say to build a door and so because no one else was calling me, that I felt like I needed to create my own opportunities. Um, I took a lot of the lessons, uh, I realized I learned a lot, design, doing branding for my clients in helping them build something. Seeing their vision come to fruition. Um, so I’m like, “Well I need to take the lessons that I have, the skills that I have, the foundation and do that for myself.” So I was very passionate about music and collecting vinyl toys, which, you know, I think I probably got a lot from you because you collect a lot of vinyl toys as well and I think I got that inspiration and I, I created this thing called a “Mugo” and what my goal was to bring a product to market. I didn’t know what I was doing. It was all just by the seat of my pants. Um, literally, uh, designed something, um, try to figure out how to find, uh, vendors and manufacturers. I knew that I needed to go to China because looking for local vendors, it was too expensive and the price-point wasn’t right, so like, how do I find vendors in Asia? And then, so a lot of this stuff was incredibly reactive, but I had a goal, like I needed to create another sort of income source. I’m gonna create my own business, separate from branding. And that’s what Mugo was. Um, and that was probably a two-year “labor of love,” getting that thing. Trying to get it off the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, and then, sort of, in the middle, there’s occasionally those small little projects that might come in, but I was, I was–that whole time–I was, everything was running on fumes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I remember.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I remember. So sometimes…a wise friend could come in and offer you advice, and you would ignore it because of our competitive spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@33:07\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And then, sometimes life sends you another message, knocking at your door, and pulls the rug out from underneath you, and you can’t attribute these…the “global forces at work,” if you will–this whole “subprime market,” it just “bottomed-out” as something that is a consequence of your action, things just do happen, but then it’s in those moments you learn that, “Oh, we didn’t prepare that emergency earthquake kit. Oh, snap! Now we gotta go do something about it.” And you tried one thing after the other, and, where is it in this part of your journey is it that you start to make these kind of fundamental changes that lead you to kinda where we’re gonna take this conversation in a little bit. What happened? Can you, can you remember? What were the triggers and how did your mindset change? Because so much of what we try to teach on this show is about “mindset.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@33:57\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah. I, I think one thing that I took from my childhood, and my, my growing up on a farm and an agricultural community is, uh, my father always taught us to, sort of, “feed the soil and not the plant.” And it was a very literal uh, um, lesson that he was trying to teach us. And what that, what that meant was, in, in order for the crop to thrive is you really need to put your focus on the soil. And, so, he taught us how to fertilize the soil, how to do crop rotation, so all of these things it was, was putting the focus on, on a foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@34:35\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And, and if you focus on the foundation, then that crop will thrive and you’ll be sustainable. If you, if you lose focus on that foundation or the soil in this metaphor, um that’s, that plant will eventually wither and die. So, when I was going through this transition, I, I was–uh–reminded of that lesson and, and used it as a metaphor that I think what I had spent so much of my time focusing on was, like myself and what I thought other people, um, wha–the importance of what they thought of me, the type of car I drove, the type of clothes I wore–and I focus more I guess on the plant, and I didn’t focus on the foundation. So, I shifted, needed to shift in my mindset to, um, thinking in a belief system that is more long-term and more foundational. So by developing something like creating my own product as something that, um, I can put a lot of the, the work into creating it. But then that would have sort of long-term effects in terms of sales, and the lessons that I learned from that I can parlay that into other opportunities. Um, and I think that’s what truly happened when I, when I started to do that–is that other opportunities came out through this experience. Uh, opportunities that I didn’t even foresee, but um, but then I sort of grasped those opportunities, and I think that’s when things started to happen. The big shift was, in conjunction with Mugo ‘cause I had to fund that and I had to just survive, is I needed to decide like, “How am I going to grow my business?” if that’s what I wanted to do. And I was reminded of, of what you always told me is like, I think there was, there was someone you met. There was a kid you met at a portfolio review and you called me up and you said, “Hey, there’s this kid, you know, he’s, he’s okay. I, I liked his energy. Give him a call. Um, try him out as an intern. Just give him one day a week.” And, you know, at that point, it’s like, I have nothing to lose. And so, I actually listened to you that time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: The one time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: The one time–or maybe the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@36:44\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was the first time. And so, uh, I called him, he came in and I interviewed him, and his portfolio was, you know, it was average, but I, I did like his energy, and so I said, “Okay, I’m gonna take this leap of faith, I don’t know how I’m gonna pay for this kid, you know, it was 10 dollars an hour, and so I said, “Well, what if I, if I fed you lunch everyday, too, would, does that sound appealing?” And he said–he was as hungry as I was. So I, I hired him, and I said, “Let’s come in, let’s try two days a week.” And he didn’t have a vehicle, and he drove a bus, it took him 2 to 2 and a half hours just to get to my place, so I knew that he was really passionate and hungry as well. So what I started to see is this, what I thought as like, maybe this kid can help me with small little tasks and errands, is what it did is it really sort of lit a fire and it re-sort of, um, brought the passion back and the energy for my craft as a designer because, uh, he would come in and I would give him tasks and I would teach him certain things and I could see the look on his face when I would teach him these things, and, and that sort of, sort of fueled my fire, and then, surprisingly what I did not expect, is he taught me a lot of things–’cause I had way too much pride. I thought I knew everything. I thought I knew everything. But he taught me a lot of things, and that’s when I sort of had a really big pivot point in my career and my life and um, looking at myself like, you know, maybe I don’t know everything. Maybe I need to re-look at this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@38:15\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I-I look at my career when I was a, a solopreneur, and I look at it as, as I was a–really a small plant in a small pot. I was this one guy in my apartment, working in this little room, wake up and I’d go to the room and I’d do my work. I was a plant in a small pot, and what I needed to do was focus on that foundation and, and grow that foundation, so I needed to get a bigger pot, so I could allow sort of my roots to grow. So, I got another computer, um, I got another workstation, I got the intern and we started doing stuff and things started happening. I didn’t know what it was, but I just knew something was different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm. Okay. Let’s hold that thought for a second here. I want to que up Emmanuel and Sam and, and Erica. If you guys have any questions, get your questions ready. I just want to read some comments from the livechat. People are saying: (This is Akman Raw–I don’t know how to say your name, but he’s like) “I’ve learned so much within the last 30 minutes.” So thank you for saying that. People are saying, “This is amazing.” Uh, “Salut.” “Teach and learn, Farm Design.” Uhh, “Amazing, you guys.” “Check it out.” “Mind blown.” So some good energy coming in. I wanted to share that with you so you could feel some of the audience feedback. Uh, uh I have tons of thoughts and ideas and questions to kind of dive in, but I’mma kick it out to the new dream team. New dream team, you got any questions or comments about this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Emmanuel] We have a question from Lallitz Gallery, umm, he’s asking, “How does a solopreneur handle his/her company during a recession?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I think you’re hearing it right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I believe you’re exactly hearing the story of how a solopreneur handles their company during a recession. And we’re gonna talk a little bit more about that so let’s okay, that’s a good question. Anything else? Anything? You guys can ask your own question, you guys. As you’re listening to the story, both of you guys are graphic designers. Emmanuel, raise your hand so people know who you are. So Emmanuel’s from, from, from Italy. From Milan?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, so, it’s ironic that you’re here and I’ll be going to Milan in a couple of weeks. That’s kind of weird. You come and I–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: I’ve been waiting for you for ages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I’m sorry. And then Sam. Sam’s from Art Center, right? You’re studying graphic design. What, what term and major are you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Sam]: Um, I’m about 8th term at Art Center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh! You’re about to graduate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: Yeah. So, haha. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, any questions so far, you guys? As you’re hearing Aaron just pour his heart out here, just on the table and the floor! You got anything for us? Erica, I, I hear, I hear you smiling and laughing in the background, so, what’s, what’s resonating and what’s connecting with you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Erica]: Uh, well mostly I’m focusing on the edit…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: But, it is really great to hear a story, um, of how someone got started and the troubles they went through, and how they realized their mindset, and I’m looking forward to, to more of it, even though half of my attention is mostly on the edit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, okay. But I, I hear your smiling and laughing at the key moments. Uh, when I make my little jokes and insert the jabs, so I, I know you’re paying attention. Okay. Anyways, people are wondering what happened to Aaron and Molly. Are they gone forever? And yes, they are gone forever. Or have they been shipped off to another country? No, they’re in the other room, working very hard, you guys. Just relax. We’re bringing in lots of different kinds of people, different energy for the topics that are relevant to them and what they’re passionate about. So let’s talk a little bit about this, so, before we kind of just broke away for a moment from the story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@41:39\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You’re kind of in this dark place. You don’t know what else to do. So you wind up bringing in somebody to help you. And I have to imagine, because I think we had these conversations before, and this is gonna touch upon a lot of what our audience is gonna feel. So when you’re not successful, you feel like, “Well who am I to take on people and to mentor? Like, I’m not even worthy of doing that. And, I’m barely making it as it is, financially. How can I afford to bring in another person? What are they gonna do for me? I don’t have any work to do, what the heck are they gonna do?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right? Does that sound about fair?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It’s pretty fair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, now so despite all that, you finally, finally let some words of wisdom trickle into the thick skull. And you actually do bring in a kid. You bring in a kid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@42:22\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And it was very generous of you, actually, because a lot of people do unpaid internships, and for you even to say, “Look, I, I, I’ll pay you hourly and then I’ll buy your lunch,” because you’re a good guy. So if you have a loaf of bread, I think you’re the type of guy who doesn’t just cut half and give it to his employee. You cut whatever you think the employee needs and you eat the crumbs that are leftover. So kudos to you, you’re a good, you’re a good man, Charlie Brown. You are. Okay? So you bring in a guy and you start to learn how to delegate. You learn how to collaborate. You learn how to manage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@42:55\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And most importantly, you’re, you’re teaching and you’re sharing what you know. And this is what they, they always say (like, teachers say this and it’s a cliché, but it’s totally true): “You learn more from the student than they will ever learn from you.” And, and I wanna explain that a little bit, but I don’t want to explain it. I want you to do it. Like, what do you mean when you say that, like, you didn’t realize you would learn so much by actually having somebody that you were gonna teach?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@43:21\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think it’s interesting…um, teaching someone things that you know. First of all, I really didn’t think I knew that much. I think I had certain levels of skill, but I say, “If you’ve been paying attention in life, you should’ve, you should learn something.” And so, having someone there where you can bounce ideas off and, and share information you realize, um, how much you actually do know. And then it starts a conversation. And that conversation stimulates and challenges each other, and I think that’s what it, it–one of the challenges of working by yourself is, “Who’s there to challenge yourself?” It’s like, do you have that intern–, that internal sort of voice that, that can do it for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@44:02\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So, having an intern or a student there who can, that can challenge you on your thoughts, who can bring new, uh, dialogue and information to the table, I think is what really started to, um, where I started to grow up as a person…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A] And made me want to learn more so I can share more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And so, we started with that collaboration. Between the two of us, uh, I, I think, I felt like I was becoming a better person and more knowledgeable, and I could see him, he was always there on time, everyday, the front door, ready to go, to, to the next task and so, that just sparked the fuel even more, and like, “Okay, where do I take this? What’s the next step?” And so I brought in another intern because the work started picking up. Um, and so I brought in another person. At that point I, I had moved and I had a house…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And, um…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So we’re gonna, we’re gonna talk. We’re gonna do the transition talk right now? Is that right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Roughly, but I think it’s, it’s important because, uh, I, I had a garage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So, I moved out of the apartment with the spare bedroom and I now had a house with a garage…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@45:19\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And a yard. And, I put in more computers. And so I’m like: “Okay.” I felt comfortable bringing that one person on. So little baby steps, little progressions, sort of, uh, scaffolding my, uh, my efforts and, and trying to build for something greater. Uh, I didn’t want to jump in head-first. I was doing little baby steps, but at least I was moving forward with the goal that I needed to do something where I can be sustainable and something that I can have to grow my business, and um, and my career. So I hired another employee. Um, it was my–it started out as an internship, uh, she was fantastic, and so I offered her a job after a few months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: But we were in the garage! And, it was difficult–I was surprised that she took the job offer because it’s like, this person who just graduated school, who I thought was incredibly talented, why would she want to come and work in my garage? So she saw something, I think in me, perhaps? I think she saw something in, in my vision, like how I wanted to grow the business, and so I needed to get that bigger pot, and so I took another leap of faith, and I got an office space in Old Town Pasadena. So, it scared me to death because now I have more expenses, more overhead, I have to pay for rent and utilities, and more computers, and the salary, um, so, it’s, it’s pushing me out of my comfort zone is really what allowed me to start to grow and, and, um, mature as an individual, and mature as a business owner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm. Okay, so, we’re gonna cut to my slides here. This is where Aaron’s office is now, right on the main strip in Old Town Pasadena. It’s right on Colorado. He’s right there above the Vans shoe store.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Vans Shoes and…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah. And something else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It’s that second floor there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And Lush. And you can see him on the second floor there with the orange lights. And I’m gonna show you guys a little about his office space. And he’s gone through some expansion. Uh, you’ve knocked out some walls and kind of moved–opened up your office, and soon, I think, you’ll probably outgrow that office, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right? That’s a probability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That pot is probably…I’m out growing that pot, and so I’ll probably need to get a bigger pot. So, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, it needs to just continue to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So here, you can see Aaron with his dog, Shelly?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Shelby.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Shelby! And, and some of his staff. Alright. And now we’re gonna look at some of his work…I know the Internet is really smart, so all our fans are probably already crawling all over your Behance site or on your website itself–uh, your website proper. But let’s take a look at some of your work. So, now you’re in the food and bev space and you’re doing really well. You’re killin’ it. You’re, you’re branding some really awesome restaurants and, just, really fun “dream” projects, if you will. Doing things from (What is this?) Craft Cider, and to Cold Brew Coffee from Califa, Califia?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Calif-fee-ya?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Calif-fee-ya, thank you. And then doing coffee packaging for Static.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And some fashion stuff, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@48:22\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: You’ll start to notice that I transitioned away from youth-lifestyle, and into…um, a portfolio that can appeal to clientele that probably could afford to pay us, that I can afford to pay my staff, and so, in order for me to do that, I had to get out of my comfort zone of doing what I knew, while I needed to–we needed to craft a portfolio that can attract clients that we wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And so…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I feel like I’ve heard that before. How…I can’t put my…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: …finger on it. I just…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think I came up with that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, probably. Okay, keep going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: But I think uh, from a lot of your audience, it’s like, how do you get to that next level? How, how do you attract a certain clientele?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@49:05\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And, I, I learned this from students, is, uh, I would ask–be asked to do a lot of portfolio reviews at my alma mater at Cal. State Northridge and AIGA, and, there was always–I’d get the portfolio from the student and it would be their–they would show work from school task, and it, the projects that they were probably the most proud of were something that was actually, they, did in real life that was actually printed, but oftentimes those projects weren’t that good. It’s like: “Oh, I designed this logo and this brochure for a bank,” for example, and I’m looking at–the design is not that great, but they think it’s the best piece in their portfolio because it was actually printed, or there was an actual client. And so, I, I learned from that, that, you know,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@49:49\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I don’t think you have to show something that you actually did, I’d rather you, you show me something that’s, uh, exemplifies your capabilities and your design skills. So if that means you have to do something on your own, or if, if you’re in class and your professor gives you a project, do the project, but then go the next step, and, and expand on that project and that system, uh, for your portfolio. So from that lesson (‘cause I didn’t want to look at projects that didn’t appeal to me), so when I started, uhh, sort of “Farm Design 2.0,” and I have employees, like, we needed to like, um, attract a new clientele, so we asked ourselves, “What sort of clients do we want to attract?” And we would, we were interested in maybe doing some sort of beverage company, we liked coffee, so, and we liked restaurants, so I tasked the, um, my employees, “Okay, let’s come up with a hypothetical project, and let’s start crafting something.” So we actually put a project brief together, we, we acted like we were the clients and we needed to have parameters, so it wasn’t the wild west and just running all over the place. We needed to have parameters, and we designed things, we mocked them up, we shot them for our portfolio, we put them out there. We put it out on Dribble, we put it out on our website, and then people started calling because they liked something–a beverage project, and then they had a beverage project themselves. And so we started getting clients based on the work that we were putting out there. So we weren’t waiting for clients to come to us, we were like, “Okay, we need to put something out there, you know, put a little bait in the water for them to bite and so we could bring them in. We have to craft something.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Uh, a good example is, uhh, we…we, I! I had an opportunity for a restaurant branding project. Honestly, I don’t remember how the guy found us, he was gonna do a pizza shop, and that was extremely exciting. It would have been our first restaurant project. He came in–and this is when we first opened our office in Pasadena, we didn’t have a lot of furniture, we didn’t have anything on the walls, it was like, I was like: “Oh my God! I, we have to look professional!” So we were actually printing stuff out and putting them on the wall like we were like super busy. He came into the office and, and we would pretend like we were really busy and we did the dog-and-pony show, and he, I thought for sure we got the project. And he didn’t call us back. And I was like, that was our opportunity to get into the restaurant business. But because we didn’t get that project, I’m like, “Okay, guys. We need to create that hypothetical restaurant project.” And we took that as an opportunity, and we put that on the Internet, and then we started getting calls to do restaurant projects. But I think that only works if you do good work. It can’t be mediocre work. Otherwise, you’re going to probably get mediocre clients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I don’t think anybody wants medio–mediocre work, period. Even mediocre clients don’t want mediocre work. Let me, let me ask you a couple of questions. So you’re fussing about doing this artwork, trying to create the appearance and the facade that you’re a happening studio, and then you don’t get the work. Any other reasons why you don’t think you got the work?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@52:55\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think there wasn’t a certain polish. I still was sort of refining sort of our, our game in terms of, “How do we sell our skills?” Look, “Who are we?” We were still trying to define who we were, um, so I think they didn’t have necessarily confidence in our ability. We probably didn’t have that body of work yet, um, to sort of lean against, um, so I think there was, there was two-fold. Um, did they have the, the trust in our ability to put–to do something? And, do you have something to support that, that I can see? They like case studies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah. I’m gonna mention a couple of things, ‘cause, I want to fill in some of the gaps for our audience. I remember talking to you about this and, and, and I think I’m glad that you’ve ultimately had made those changes, but I remember looking at your portfolio. So now you, you have your foot half into this other world (we’ll just call it the “adult world”), and half of the other foot in the youthful action-sports-lifestyle brand world. And I think even at this point (‘cause you and I, we’ve had so many conversations, especially when you still lived in Santa Monica), we’d go out to lunch, first it would be once a week, and then twice a week, and it seemed like we’re having lunch every single day. And I was just meeting up with you, we would chat, basically, just trying to help a friend level-up his business game, which is something I felt really good about. But I remember seeing like really beautiful, mature typography and work for real estate clients, and some beautiful identity design work that was in conflict with this other (if you guys remember back to surf brands, those kind of stuff he was doing), it was diametrically opposed in look and tone. So I, I don’t know if I articulated that clearly to you at that point in time. You do need to make a choice. Because it’s, it’s kind of schizophrenic. People show up at your site, they’re gonna see something or they’re gonna ask themselves: “Which designer am I getting? Am I getting the more sophisticated, mature person who can understand big businesses? Or do I want that youthful, edgy energy?” And I think at that point you weren’t quite ready to let that go, but ultimately you did, and you started to change portfolios. So, a recurring theme here–that I’m gonna try to do my best to articulate is your ability to look in the moment, and make some really hard decisions that seem to go against every fiber of your being. We trace it back to “I just want to do the work,” “I have great pride and ownership,” “I think it’s good–and it’s ethical for me to do the work,” and then to let that go, to let that go and it transformed you. Then to take on more employees and then to make a big commitment. Anybody that’s been out there who has had to sign a lease, it’s like a 3-year lease, you’re making a commitment–a promise to pay somebody else rent that you’re not sure if you’re going to be able to do for the next 3 years. That is a big “gut-check” moment. And you’re doing all these things (you call them “small, scaffolding steps”), but really, they’re giant commitments internally that you have to get over. And to also let go of some of the past to make room for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And you did all that and I, I–kudos to you. It took you awhile (I, I always say, like, you would be ten times big and successful if you just moved a little faster), but you’re, you’re super successful now, and I want to show a little bit more of your work. But, there’s another thing that I want to talk about here and you’ve mentioned it a couple of times so I feel that I need to point it out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@56:00\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: When Hugh Barton was on here, the psychotherapist, he talked about the difference between “self-confidence” and “self-esteem.” I’ve never heard this before explained this way (and I hope I don’t butcher this prat): “self-confidence” is how you feel about you and your work when nobody is around; “self-esteem” is how you feel when other people are around. And I think they’re one and the same because you truly cannot be self-confident if you don’t have the self-esteem. Well, why is that? Because you had mentioned twice now that you brought in this superstar designer, and you weren’t sure if she would want to work with you because you’re working out of your garage. So I’ve never suffered from that because I always thought, “I have a lot to share, and the work is going to be really good.” Don’t worry about the Ikea tables and the cardboard box that we work out of. And then that, that popped up again when you had clients come in, and you’re like: “Oh! Let’s make sure we look a certain way!” When I wanted to spend all my energy working on the internal, working on the mindset, the self-esteem, the self-confidence, so I could learn how to talk to people. ‘Cause in theory then, when all that stuff goes away, when it, when it gets torched or something happens, you still have the stuff inside, and that’s the important stuff. But, the last thing that you mentioned, which is (a thing that we referred to as “closing the gap”), a lot of creative people, they know their fullest potential and they keep saying to themselves: “If a client ever gave me the opportunity, I would do this amazing work!” What they’re doing is they’re putting the burden of work and the leap of faith and the risk in the client’s hands. You said to yourself, very wisely: “We want to do this kind of work. Realistically, looking at our own work, we’re not going to get this kind of work based on our portfolio. So we need to make the time and energy and, and put the resources together to, to put this kind of work out.” And it, and you for, for doing what you did, almost–it felt instant results. You put out the projects, it got talked about, it got shared on all these sites and these blogs, and then all this attention was now turned onto you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And it was wonderful, so you were rewarded for making your efforts about showing the people, the world, the potential that you believed in yourself, but hadn’t shown before. And that’s how you go about and get this work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@58:05\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So you guys out there that are scratching your head and thinking about this right now, how do I make that transition from being a “poor, broke person” (but not broken person, just a broke person), and, how do I make that transition? How do I get out of that? So close the gap. You have to do good work. All of the conversation we’re having right now, you guys, means that you have to know your craft. That’s the beginning part, but that’s not the end. That’s just the beginning. Okay. Any other questions? And I’mma show more of your work and we’re gonna kind of figure out like life lessons, things that you can peel away from this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Any other kind of questions, you guys? People are saying this is like the “best livestream ever,” it’s like, that’s a little hyperbolic, but I’ll take that. Okay. Somebody’s putting in quotes (air quotes). Gianfranco, uhh, he’s saying “Adult-design equals money?” I don’t know. Alright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: We got a couple of questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You do? Okay, fire away, man.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: Yeah, um, this one comes from Galley Taylor?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright, speak into the mic, dude.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: Oh.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: This one comes from Galley Taylor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Much better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: And, she’s asking, uh, if: “When you look for a client–uh, when you look for clients, do you look for one with definite budgets for service, or do you look, do you work with clients to organically develop a budget for your service?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Do you understand the question?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yes, I do. You know I was, when you’re hungry, you’ll take any client. So when you’re developing and you’re trying to build that foundation, you’ll take pretty much any client, as long as they’re willing to pay you for your craft. So as you evolve and you become, um, more polished, uh, I think the rules change a little bit and, um, I think, fortunately for, uh, my business (Farm Design) that uh, we’ve evolved quite a bit in a really short period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@59:53\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And so the rules that I look for in a, in work, uh, I call it the sort of the “3 Ps.” It’s 3 rules I wanna try to hit and I, to determine if it’s the right project for us and, and the 3 Ps are: Portfolio, profit, and people. So portfolio is, I look at it when someone calls me, is it gonna be a project that I get really excited about? A juicy project? Something that I, I want to put into my portfolio? I want to take pride in? Um, the other one is: profit. Uh, I want to assess to see if the, the client is qualified, if they have a budget, and, uh, so I dig deeper, and I, you know, you ask those questions, sometimes it’s unveiled when you, when you do a proposal. And the third one is, um: people. Um, they say like 85% of your problems come from 15% of your clients, um…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s actually 80-20, it’s the Pareto Principle, but yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:00:50\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So I fudged it a little?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So I’ve worked with a lot of–what I consider–like, “bad” clients, and, and it just, it takes the soul out of you when you work with certain people that either they don’t respect you or they don’t respect your craft, or conversely so. So I think it’s really important when you’re in a business relationship that, um, it’s a healthy relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:01:11\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So my role is: I need to have at least 2 of those working for me. You can’t just have one and I think that the, the unicorn is if you can have all 3. So, when assessing like type of work that uh we want to work for, or the type of people, um, so I don’t necessarily have to have make money every single time I take a job if the people I respect and they’re fun to work with, and it’s a portfolio piece that’s really exciting. ‘Cause I know that’s an investment that’s gonna get the next job. Um, but you can do any, any combination, but for me it’s gotta be at least 2 out of those 3.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah. Okay. 2 out of the 3. Any other questions? Emmanuel? Sam?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Yeah, we have a question from…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Fire away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Jaimie Montaño. Uhh, she’s asking: “How do you produce good work when you’re in a hurry because you’re super low on cash?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You got it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:01:59\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah. “How do you produce work?” I, I don’t believe in working fast. I, I think, um, as a, as a creative director guiding my design staff, I, I never say: “Work faster. Hurry up.” Because I, I think you’re just going to get inferior work. They’re just gonna like, “Uhhhhhhh.” There’s gonna–there’s that tension and they’re trying to craft something. I, I believe in being highly productive, and so, um, trying to do something in a short period of time, I think, part of it is you gotta be realistic with the project and the timelines that you take on. I, I think it would be a disservice to your client if you take on a project that you can’t meet the deadlines, and if you can’t do it at a certain uh standard and quality that, uh, that you believe in, then, you, you, you simply shouldn’t take it. You have to be able to walk away from a project because ultimately you’re going to tarnish that relationship and they’re not gonna come back. Um, I buh–I believe in building relationships so that client continues to come back. I, I’m personally not a salesperson, so I, I don’t do traditional-like sales, cold calls. I don’t do a lot of outbound sort of marketing ‘cause it’s just not my style, so, when I have an opportunity to work with a client, I wanna make sure I, I put my best foot forward because I want to be able to continue that working relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:03:19\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Do you guys have a follow-up question for him? I’m trying to monitor Facebook and, and YouTube as well. Wel, why don’t we do this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: I…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, go ahead, Erica.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Um, so, do you have any projects that you regret doing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Any projects that…?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You regret doing? Any projects that you regret doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:03:38\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Oh, wow. That’s a great question. Absolutely. I’m trying to–haha–I, I think, oftentimes, the projects that I regret are because I didn’t align or have the same values or principles as my client. Um, so I think it’s not necessarily uh if I made money or didn’t make money, if, or, um, if it’s uh, a portfolio piece or not, I think the projects that I regret most are aligning with someone that they didn’t respect our craft or I didn’t respect their vision, and so, I try to avoid those relationships. But! Sometimes you don’t know until you get into that relationship, so, it’s, it’s, it’s challenging and, and sometimes you have to be willing to accept the fact that it may not be a good relationship and like, and just, say, “You know, I just don’t think it’s a good fit. And I think, uh, I wish you the best of luck,” and you just part ways. But, um, “projects that you regret,” it’s…I think, I will continue to encounter those, and–but I’m always trying to like do my, uh, best due diligence to sort of curb the, that. But it’s, it’s challenging.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Uh, I have a follow-up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Um, so how do you deal with those projects where you realize that “Maybe we shouldn’t have taken this?” But you did and then you have to follow through with it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:05:08\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I seldom, I, I don’t like to leave people in a lurch. I think there’s something about my personality, so, I, I, I don’t typically will walk away from a challenging situation. Um, I, I think if it’s the, the client, and it’s a tumultuous relationship where there’s tension and we’re not seeing eye to eye, then I’m just gonna have that conversation with them that, you know, I think maybe there’s someone better for you. And then we sort of figure out some sort of exit strategy. I think otherwise if we continue down this uh, this tumultuous relationship then I don’t think we’re gonna be able to produce our best work, the experience is gonna be tarnished and at the end, ultimately, neither party is gonna be happy, so, why go through that, that long process? I think it’s best to just be open and transparent, and just say, “I, I think we’re not the best fit.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. I, I wrote down some things here. Let’s see here. There was a question from YouTube that asked: “Is that fake restaurant project still available on your site somewhere? And what’s it called?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It’s not on our website anymore, but it lives on the Internet because one of the great things is…the, there’s a, an influential blog called “The Dieline”…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, there’s a, other blogs out there, and when we put projects out there, and with technology and social media, um, people pick it up if it’s noteworthy and they share that information. So, the projects still live out there, I think the one I was referring to is called “Old Boy Blues?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm. I’m gonna find it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: “Old Boy Blues.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And, the designer that worked on that, she was actually an intern at my company. She is now my art director and she’s been with me for 5 years. So, this project was, you know, it was kind of a labor of love and we, we were like trying to feel it out. And it was all mock-ups. It was hypo–purely hypothetical, but that got us our first restaurant project and today, we, we do a ton of restaurant work and I think on any given day, we’re probably working on 2 or 3 restaurant projects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I am not finding your project here. But I will trying finding–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: “Old Boy…Blues?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uhh, I’ll try, but let me do “Farm Design” and see what I come up with. You can keep talking to me while I find this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, I think, um, talking about how, um, technology can help drive marketing for yourself, is even the Mugo project that we were referring to earlier is, it got picked up by The Dieline. I didn’t expect this. Um, they picked it up because I had posted something on my website, uh, The Dieline picked it up and posted it, and then I started getting all these calls, and one of the calls I got was from Dreamworks. Uh, Dreamworks contacted me and they said they wanted to do uh, a licensing partnership deal with me on, on Mugo. And this is all because I put something out there. I tried to create an opportunity, I didn’t know where it was gonna take me, but I knew that I needed to put something out there and create my own opportunities, and then I was able to get Mugo into Walmarts and Urban Outfitters and, and retail, but I, I learned a lot from that. I’m no longer doing Mugo, but I think that opportunity taught me a lot of lessons about the business side of design and it took a lot, um, less off the creative side, so when I’m going into meetings with clients, I can talk about the business side, which I learned through Mugo. Like, what is your go-to market strategy? How, you know, what is your, um, what are your costs? Um, what is your distribution channels? You know, you ask these questions and I never would have been informed and knew how to ask, because I was a designer, I was more talking about the right font and the colors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:09:04\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: But I think if you talk uh business on a strategic level and you bring value to um, the relationship, then that’s when, uh, they’re more intrigued and uh, see you as a valued partner as opposed to just as a designer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And that’s when my business really started to grow, is when I changed the dialogue from “design” to “business strategy.” And I think that’s a big part of why my business sort of took another step.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, I’m gonna make a note to follow up on this, but I found “Ol’ Boy Blues.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s right here on the screen. It’s ‘cause I was typing “old,” I didn’t know it was “Ol’ Boy Blues.” So this is what it looks like. I remember you working on this. And this reminded me to kind of ask you this question about mock-ups and things like that, because some people in our pro-group, I, I told them you’re gonna be on the show and they said, “Ask him about how he does such a great job with his mock-ups and Behance.” Are there any tips that you can share with us? How much labor is put into these photographs that we are seeing here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:10:00\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Well, we’re not photographers so we just, we just do the best we can. We just try to figure it out, and I think that’s the, that’s the whole key to these things. It’s just, you figure it out. Just, just go into it, not necess–you don’t have to know the outcome. You just have to be willing to take that first step. Um, so this, we, we–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Now take for example this image here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Is this a stock photo that you comp’d the thing onto the brick wall?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No, we actually, there was, this is one of the alleyways behind, uh, one of our office, our office in Pasadena, and we, we shot this, with the, with the SLR camera and then we actually photoshopped uh the graphics onto the brick wall there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Who’s the guy wearing the vest carrying the crate and the bicycle?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: He was an employee at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh! Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And uh, so yeah. He modeled for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. And he had a vest and an old straw hat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That’s his style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. What restaurant are we photographing this in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, so we’re like: We need to get that contextual shot, and so we actually went into uh, uh, a burger place, and we said, uh, “We’re doing a student project. Would you mind if we shot some photos?” And they said, “No problem.” So we ordered some food and we took some snapshots.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, I remember at this time, you barely even knew how to use the camera, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I was terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I remember ‘cause you were asking me questions–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I still don’t know how to use the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, well that’s fine. But you knew enough now on how to take a shot that’s kind of lit well and kind of understand lighting. And it’s a key part to you being able to do such great mock-ups.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, for us it’s a lot about storytelling, so it’s like we wanted to tell the story, the brand story, contextualize it and, and so that was, that was circa–there might be a date on there–circa 2012, maybe? 13?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Something like that. That’s okay. And then I want to look at your portfolio now on Farm, Farm Design on Behance. You get a lot of leads on, from Behance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: We get a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You get a lot. And so I want to talk about this for a brief moment ‘cause I’ve been harping on this to our audience. And they’re like: “Chris, I can’t get any work!” And I said, “Are you on Behance? What does it look like? And how much effort and energy did you put into those things?” So, I’m gonna step onto this one since it’s the newest one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: This “Ciderworks” thing here. Let’s take a look at it. Go ahead and talk us through this thing. What are you doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: This is a project that we just launched yesterday. It’s called “Bivouac.” It’s a cider company in San Diego, California, they came to us maybe a year and a half ago because they saw some logos that we put on Behance that also was just a hypothetical project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Which one was that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That was, um, uh “Rust Coffee.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Rust Coffee, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You guys look–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So we, we put…you know, so they found us on Behance, uh, they contacted us and we started–uh, they do cider. They wanted to do canned cider. They wanted to have a restaurant, um, sort of a, uh, uh, a watering hole for their clients or consumers, and, this is a year and a half process. And so when we put this together, it’s, it’s a combination of uh, telling a story, telling a brand story and hitting a lot of sort of the different facets of the brand, um, we try to look at sort of micro and macro sort of stories. A lot of what you see here are (those cans and boxes), those are mock-ups. So, whether we do a uh 3-D model, um or we use stock photography sites–uh, those I think we got from um, yellowimages.com, they do all these really great, sort of mock-ups with lighting, and so um we buy those off of there. And a lot of these other ones, like, when we look at stock photography, like you here, you have here with the guy holding the, the beer bottle, his…finding the right stock photography that doesn’t look like stock photography, that also aligns with the vision of the brand, so, it’s not just like pulling a photo and dropping it in there. It’s like you have to really curate and think about how that story works. Is it the right demographic? Does it have the right lighting and the tonality? Um, that one there, we loved to use stocksy.com is a really great sort of stock photo site. They don’t feel stock. We also use Shutterstock, um, dot com, but Shutterstock typically is, is good for, um, more sort of pedestrian-looking images. They do look kind of stock. But it’s a combination of mocking things up, shooting things, shooting them in-studio, um, shooting them out-of-studio…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well here’s what I wanna do: I want to break this thing down. And I’m gonna prep you for this in case you don’t want to do it. But, I’m gonna ask you a little bit about the business part of this thing, but not just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Let’s talk about these cans. Is this CG? Computer generated? Or is this photographed?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Can you tell me? What do you think?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I think it’s CG.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: How can you tell?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: ‘Cause I know you don’t know how to photograph cans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay. You are correct. It is, it is a mock-up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Hold on! I’m sorry for that!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It is a mock-up. But, I think–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s beautiful!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think some of the best, um, interpretations of branding are mock-ups. I don’t think it has to be a photograph.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: No apologies. No apologies, dude. I don’t care. I think it looks great! I, I’m only guessing because I-you said, “I still don’t know how to take photos.” And to take a can sweating like this, it’s not that easy to do, and I look at the gradations a lot. You used that yellow? What, what?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yellow Images.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yellow Images for this. How much did it cost you to buy the model for this and put uh, put your label on it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: A dollar fifty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Two hundred and fifty dollars, okay. A dollar fifty, you guys!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: A dollar fifty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: A dollar fifty. So that’s like–thanks for sharing this. Now, I, I just want to take a moment and say this to you guys that are out there: Aaron could have hoarded these resources. He could have said, “You guys just figure it out.” Because if you guys go look for 3-D mock-ups, you might spend quite a bit of time, trial and error, in finding the right vendors. So I really appreciate you saying that, and I’ve not heard of “Stocksy” before, and we’ll talk a little bit more about that. So he’s sharing his resources–he’s basically saying: “You guys, go out there and make better comps.” And, and I’m not, I’m not gonna feel the competition from you right now.” Let’s keep going on here. Why did you put this kind of “mountain-scape” behind it? Tell me about the thinking behind that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:15:55\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Sure. Well, Farm Design is a branding agency, so, we are trying to attract clients and build brand systems for them. So it’s not just a logo, it’s not just a website. We like to build systems. In order to build a, uh, a brand system that is effective and can connect and communicate with their audience, you have to have many different facets to it. And so, there’s a lot of sort of tertiary, um, secondary and tertiary sort of, um, artifacts (is what we like to call them), so, a primary artifact can be a logo. And if you scroll down a little bit farther, you know, you also have secondary marks, colors, textures…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Hold on. Lemme, let me drive this a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Tell me about the mountain though. So are you, where does this label go? Is this for an ad? Or you just added this for you, for the presentation of it? Did they actually use this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: They did. Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That one was actually born from one of the moodboards we created.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I see.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And we actually used that uh, “texture,” if you will–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, uh, sort of kind of a misty, uh, ethereal background, um, to capture the essence of this adventure and outdoor lifestyle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C] Yeah, it’s just a cold mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I want my beverages to be cold, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, this restaurant photo: Is this their actual place? Their business?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: This is their actual place. It just literally opened up 2 days ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I see. So this is fresh off the press.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Where is this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: San Diego.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So you drove down to San Diego and you took this photo?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was given to us and we’re actually going to go there and shoot it with, uh, consu–our, uh, consumers in the space, ‘cause I think it brings a different dynamic. So even though we posted it now, we’re going to constantly update this to sort of enhance and improve it so we want to reshoot these and, and bring a different energy to it with having people in it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:17:41\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Why is it important for you to constantly improve and revisit these presentations you have on Behance?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Because I know that there are clients out there that are constantly looking at us. Not only today, you know, next month, a year from now, so, why not? We have the opportunity. This is, this is dynamic information. It’s not static. It’s like, once you put it up there, it doesn’t have to–it’s not permanent. It’s not like we’re printing something, an you have to burn it and reprint it. It’s, it’s so easy just to repopulate it and, on this forum, and because clients down the road, they’re gonna see it, and they’re gonna want. And they’re gonna see those details and the nuances, so we’re always trying to improve our craft…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Constantly improving our craft.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:18:21\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright, I want to say this to you guys. There’s this concept from Jim Rohn’s book, “The 7 Strategies for Wealth and Happiness.” He talks about the minors and the majors, what you don’t want to do is mix up these 2 things. You don’t want to make a minor effort for a major result or a goal. And you also don’t want to make a major effort for a minor goal. When you’re talking about your lead-gen source, basically all your sales and marketing, in terms of inbound, is coming from Behance, so it behooves you to do the very best job, and I’ve seen him do this and assign teams to do this, they could spend days, if not weeks working on the layout, the typography, the color palette, the phrasing, the order, and revisit with photography, and that’s why your work stands out. There are a hundred thousand, maybe a couple million people on Behance. Well, why is it always that the best work rises to the top? It’s because they put the time and energy into it and you need to do the same. I, I want to go back and it’s getting close to us breaking for the show here, and I’m sure our livestream audience probably doesn’t want it to end, but it’s gonna end at some point, so I want to dissect this really quickly, just give me shorter answers as what slide you want to talk about. This is a deep-dive into his portfolio, his sales and marketing technique because of the work that we’re seeing here. “Embrace your adventure.” Did you guys write that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yes, we did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And so there’s a little typographic–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Brand voice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And they can use that. I saw it on the can. And again, there’s another photo here. I’m assuming that’s stock photo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Correct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And then, this is another 3-D mock-up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693827b0dbce3f_AaronAtchison_work2.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yes, again, Yellow Images.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm. Really good. Look–look at that corrugated cardboard there! You guys, that’s lookin’ really slick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, I say, ‘cause when I look at portfolios and I can tell that it’s a mock-up, that, I–I say it’s revealing the man behind the curtain. I want to try to craft something that you can’t quite tell, like, “Hmm, is that real or not?” That’s the level of detail that we’re trying to get, so like how the light hits it, how the shadows reflect, all those little nuances, if you can make it where you don’t reveal the man behind the curtain, then I think, then it’s okay. Then we’re gonna post it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Are they giving you the 3-D model? Or you give them the artwork and they render it for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It, it’s actually really great because if you subscribe to a premium version on YellowImages.com, you can actually have them do a 3-D render for you. You just give them the drawings, and I think in 2 to 4 weeks, then they’ll give you something. But then they’ll use that as, uh, they’ll sell that on–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: The stock model.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: As a stock model on there, ‘cause they’re just trying to build content as well, so for a small fee of 300 dollars a year…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: They’ll actually make custom renders for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: What’s the limitation and how many can you get done?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I believe it’s just one angle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh, I mean in a year. Uh, you pay 300 dollars in a year–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Unlimited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Wow!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, guys.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: If you were to hire a CG guy to do it–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Of course.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: The’re gonna charge more than 300. This, I think–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: For sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think they’re in Russia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well, whatever. Okay, so if you guys should be in a 3-D, mock-up rendering business, you are now just out of business. Okay, let’s keep going here. “Ride the winds of change.” Something you wrote…the feather…the same misty mountains…these coasters. Are these mock-ups?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It is a mock-up, and you can tell, like, we even put like a, like a, uh, water stain on the actual coaster, uh shadows and we, so we composited all that together with the background, um…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Photo-comping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, the whole thing is, like, is a composite. And this entire project here, I would say we probably invested around 100 hours to sort of mock this up. ‘Cause this is maybe 2 people working on it for over a week?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That’s, that’s how important it is to us, because I know the investment of that time and effort–I have to pay these, my employees to do this!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, I understand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So it’s an investment, and we know that this is gonna beget the next project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right. And I’m gonna say something that is both a complement and an insult to you. You ready? I tell my team: “Guys, look at these mock-ups. This is the gold standard,” to my team. And, “We can do better than this because we’re better than them, aren’t we? Are you telling me we’re not as good as them?” So I, I kinda just throw it out there. So if you guys (my team) can’t make better mock-ups and layouts than this, you’re not worth that much to me. I don’t say it quite like that, but, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:22:22\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Where is the insult?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: The insult’s: We’re better than this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think anyone can be better than this, and, and I know that–and, and with that–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:22:31\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It’s like, we’re all, we also know that we can be–get better at this game as well, and so, a year from now, we expect our portfolio and our mock-ups to be better…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: …than it is today. So, you never just settle on your laurels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I, I do want to say this: Your mock-up game is tight. So, you’re, you’re already at that kind of upper echelon. Are these your shoes?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That is me, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I can recognize your foot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Wait, that was also a composite because the, the…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: …photo wasn’t great, and so we composited things together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: A lot of color-correction, shadows, reflections, uhhh beer stains. All that–err–water stains. So this is, so you guys know when, when they say that they’re a branding agency, they truly are ‘cause they’re writing copy, they, they’re working on a lot more touch points than just the mark itself or just one package. They’re trying to create the entire kind of visual reflection of what this brand is all about. Okay, so I think you did a great job there of explaining all that stuff, of course, this is the sort of stuff we see in a lot of sites, and you like to do these multiple logos (that you call them “brand artifacts”), I think that’s, that’s the thing that you like to, to do for your clients. This is a stock photo, I’m pretty sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:23:32\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: This guy’s throwing hops, or whatever he’s doing right here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Correct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:23:34\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Great. Good job, man! And I, I do want to say this to both designers and clients who are potentially watching this episode, is that: There are a lot of really great images out there. Maybe too many. And the problem is the ability to hone and find just the right image. So the image might not cost you very much in terms of payment, like, to buy an image off Shutterstock or Stocksy, it’s, it’s really pennies compared to what it would cost to commission somebody. What you are paying for is somebody with an eye who can curate this stuff and scan hundreds of–if not thousands–of images to find the one right fit for you. And that is a skill, and that is worth paying for. ‘Cause they’ve taken an asset that is a dollar and they’ve made it a hundred-thousand dollar image.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Because they’ve selected the right one, they might have gone and color-corrected it and adjusted some things so it becomes something that–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Absolutely. Those details, the curation is so important. And, it’s like, you can tell pretty quickly if that’s a stock photographer–photograph, or a mock-up. We try to, sort of, increase that perception of what that is and be able to tell a story. So your focusing on the story. And I think if you do it really well, I think that’s, that’s what we’re trying to accomplish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:24:44\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. I want to talk a little bit about business now. Could we talk some business?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. How much did you get paid for that project?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: The Bivouac?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That was an interesting one because it was, uh, I actually got stock options in the business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Woohoo! Excuse me! It’s the dinger on that! There we go. Alright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Oh my God. Did you really…?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, I did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Nah, um. So I’m actually, uh, part owner, but very small.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Very, very small. But if this thing gets sold to Budweiser, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You’ll, you’ll, you’ll combine that with–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, but in lieu of, uh, in terms of cash, it was, um, I think it was 45 thousand?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Whoof!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: 45 thousand?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Good for you!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So it was in 3 payments, uh, spread out over a year and a half but, um, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Excellent. And when you told the client–we’ll talk about some of the mindset stuff here–here, let me put this down, uhh, 45 thousand dollars, we always have these kind of fears, like, “Uhh, is it too much? Is it too little?” Tell me about your mindset when you’re like working on the estimate for this thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:25:49\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay, so, the, the individual who contacted us actually was already engaged with, with another agency down in San Diego, an agency that (when I was in school, over 20 years ago), I looked up to. I would buy books because their logos were in it, and–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I know who you’re talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: They were, they were, they’re amazing. They’re still amazing. And when I heard that he’s working with them, I’m like: “Okay, we’re kind of not in your league, or the league that you’re looking for.” But he said, “I saw the ‘Rust’ project,” (and you can–) it’s on our Behance page it’s–and that was a hypothetical project. He said, “I just love what you guys do, there’s something about that.” And so, he wanted us to put a proposal together. I, I knew the agency that he was already engaged with, but that he was having, um, concerns with. And, so I, I took a risk, like, I’m gonna go bid higher out of my comfort zone because you’re always pushing us and, and on the ph–when we chat, we have our tea time and you’re always saying: “Ask for more! Why are you ask–you can, you can ask! Like okay, this is this one time\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: This is this one time I think I’m gonna listen to Chris again. I’m gonna try to go out of my comfort zone, because probably my comfort zone is…far less. And so I put that proposal together, and my number (I said it was 45) I found out that the other agency, I think, was 120 thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So I was woefu–I was like woefully less than them, but I was con–incredibly content with what I got.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:27:25\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: But could I, could I have asked for more? But, it’s like, you know, you’re always sort of trying to figure out what your comfort level is, and what your value you bring to the project, and you, you’re always assessing if the client can afford you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right. I, I want to talk about this for a brief minute. ‘Cause there are not many people who are on this show, who know me as well as you do. We’ve had thousands of hours of talking–sometimes personal, sometimes business–uh, in the last 20 years that we’ve known each other. I just want to give you guys an opportunity here, for you to totally mock me right now. When I’m talking to you and I’m like, “Aaron, blah blah blah.” You can par–you can, you can do your parody of what you think you hear when I say these things. I would love to hear you say that, for our audience, for our fans, I think they’re gonna like it. What do you hear? Like when I’m barking these things at you, what do you hear? How does this sound like in your brain?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@1:28:16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I mean…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You ready?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Oh my gosh…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You–do your close-up! Right there!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Oh my gosh!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Tell the people how it sounds in your brain. I’ll get out of your shot, go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:28:23\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Well, I mean, when we first started, we were kind of like enemies because we were like–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: We’re not enemies!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No, we were! We started out as enemies! Like, I just wanted to crush you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I never saw it like that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And then\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It was easy to crush you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: You know, I always admired what you’ve been able to accomplish and build before even before you started The Futur, and it, it was really impressive, but I think a lot of my pride and stubbornness is like, I, I don’t want to listen to someone who is “up here.” I, I probably would listen to my parents, but I didn’t want to listen to you. And so it, for you it was just like, I, I can figure it out. I’m gonna do it my own way. And, I had to sort of realize that you’re giving me like really sound advice. So, it’s hard for me to, to parody you, but I just…I had to break down walls and sort of let you (like I, I, you’re younger than me, but I consider you like my “wise uncle”). I don’t know if that’s an insult, but no! You, you provide so much knowledge, whether it’s right or not, it’s like I, I, I start to filter it, and I start to slowly let it creep in. So it’s a–it’s been a slow burn, but I, I think I’m, I’m more open to, uh, listening to you because I think you provide, like, great content for your, your audience and I think, I think they see incredible value. So I, as, as much as you want me to mock you, I’m gonna thank you. Can I, can I just pivot? Can I just–can we do that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You can do whatever you want, man. I was trying to give you your opportunity to blast it out of the universe!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No, I, I’m–that’s not, that’s not my personality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: How are you not gonna mock me because other people have and they’ve done a fantastic job, so here’s what I heard (uhh, Aaron used these words): “Enemy, creep, and burn.” So, you can put those things together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah. It’s all good. It’s all good. We have a great relationship, you guys. Okay, umm, Erica, Emmanuel, and Sam: Do you guys have any last thoughts before I close out on the deck, you guys?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Emmanuel]: Umm, I have a question from Aina San: “Umm, what do you do when you’re professional opinion or own project differs from what client wants? And he can’t be convinced?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Did you hear what he said?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Nah, I didn’t hear…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Basically, what do you do when your clients start to take aw–the project away from what it’s supposed to be? How do you respond to that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:30:37\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: God, that’s a great question. We’re, we’re challenged with this all the time. All the time. Uh, I think at the end of the day, ultimately they are the client, and they hired you to provide them a service. The best that we can do is we can, we can shepherd the process the best we can. We also know that we probably know more than them on a branding standpoint. So the best we can do is we can say, “Our professional advice is that, we would urge you to do this.” Ulti–ultimately at the end of the day, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do. And that’s the way it, it’s gonna be. Um, so you’ve got to pick your battles, um, but you try to do what is best for the client, and, but at some point you gotta, you gotta just let them do what they’re gonna do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, I hope that answered the question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It, it’s your answer. That’s good enough for me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright, guys. I want to thank you for coming on the show. Aaron, before we say goodbye, I want to look at some of your work and talk a little bit about your journey, and I’m gonna send this out. Alright? With some music, I think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Can, can I say–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You can say whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A] That when we talk about my journey, it’s like I, I wanna give a shout out to the people that aren’t here in the studio, and that’s all my employees.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Past and present.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: ‘Cause yeah. Because they help shape who I am and they help shape the business, and so this output is a collective, uh, a collective group of really talented and young individuals. Um, so I just don’t, I want to make sure everyone knows that this is not me, this is a collection of like I think really like-minded, um, individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well, I can’t leave you there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I, I can’t. When you say, “This is not me,” I, I see a man transformed from the guy who’s like, “I, I can’t even hire an intern to cut things for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: From 10 years ago whenever that was in 2000-ish. Somewhere in 2005, to now, 13 years later. What has happened to that man? What happened to Peter Pan?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:32:37\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: You know, I realized that in order to grow, that you have to accept that you don’t know everything. And so, I, I, I think I was very humbled when I sort of hit rock bottom, um, and I sort of reassessed who I am and who I wanted to be, so for me, I want to do things that are greater than myself, and do things that are fulfilling, and I think one of the greatest things that, um, I’ve learned and that is fulfilling to me, is helping others become better people as well, so, I–for me, it’s no longer working. The work doesn’t–it’s not, I’m not doing it for myself, I’m doing it to support and nurture my staff, and my clients, and I think that is the biggest reward. It’s not a monetary thing, um, it’s not re–awards on the wall, it’s really like, seeing individuals that I work with, and clients that I work with, succeeding in life, and, there’s a couple of designers and my, my staff, they actually are taking things that they learn from me, and then they are mentoring students now, so they are volunteering their time on weekends, and they created their own program, and they’re sharing information that they learned from me, so there’s–that is, that is pretty powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:33:51\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So I just wanna like keep empowering people to empower people and, and to be in that situation–I wasn’t in that situation when I was a solopreneur. I was just focusing on me. Now I’m focusing on something beyond me, so when I say this isn’t just me, I, I’m trying to lead a team, and I just, you know, they’re the ones that are sort of helping with the vision, and sort of guiding this path that we’re all going down. It’s not–I’m, I’m just trying to like, pave the way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm, mm. Okay, so here’s what I’m hearing from you. Is that when you’re working by yourself as a solopreneur, it becomes, kind of like this echo-chamber and (I hate to say it like this, but) it was very ego-centric\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Very much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And it was about all “me, me, me, me.” It’s like, “Marsha, Marsha, Marsha,” and that’s what it became. And what I’m hearing from you now is that (if, if I read this correctly), it’s that now you take great pride, not in the work that you do, but in terms of how you’re transforming other people’s lives, so when your team grows, and they do great work, you can take pride in that that you were able to create space or guidance or mentorship, or just helping them define the right clients, to get to that place. And then you also couple it off with, “It wasn’t about I wanted to do from a design point of view (which is self-centered and selfish), it was about trying to help your clients also have that same kind of success. So you can’t have a successful business without being a different kind of person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Everybody wants to be successful, so few people are willing to do the work that’s needed to change, and, and to me, that’s what you’ve been able to do. You’ve taken everything that I think is uh, an accumulation of your experiences and biases, and you’ve gone against that. You’ve let go of so many things. And that’s what has been, I think, the key to your transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Uh, uh, I think that’s pretty accurate. I think it’s, it’s getting out of your comfort zone and challenging yourself, and I think that’s when you grow as an individual. And then, learning from that and you challenge people around you to help them grow, so, getting out of that comfort zone, I think is a big part of growth. In order to get out of your comfort zone, you have to be able to accept the fact that you don’t know everything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. So let’s look at a couple, few, last slides and we’re gonna close up the show, or close out the show. Here’s some more things. Of course, you guys can go to Behance and look up Farm Design. There’s a couple of Farm designs there, but you’ll recognize the work and then you can look the rest of his portfolio, and I believe Aaron is relaunching the site on Thursday-ish, so if you go to FarmDesign.net–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: –You’ll be able to see the freshly minted site. And this is really wonderful, beautiful work. It’s got really great attention to detail, patterns and textures and color palettes, and I, I truly appreciate and love all the contextual applications that you provide. So seeing it in context makes it feel so real and so rich. I don’t mean in terms of price, but it’s just a feast for the eyes and I think that’s what you guys want to do. And you see this diversity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:36:44\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Now, I look at this little boy, who loved basketball and you’re, you’re an athletic dude, and I see like what you’ve become, as the boy from, from Montana, to the, to the man who’s like running in Spartan races and you’re pretty hardcore. And, and you’re super competitive. So competitive I, I’m like, you just, you leave me in the dust. You keep doing these things. Okay, I’m just trying to limp across the finish line myself. And, you, you were a guy who was afraid of commitment, afraid of being out in the public, to speaking at TED (a HUGE accomplishment there), kudos to you, and, making the ultimate commitment, and getting married. And before anybody starts to cry, we’re gonna end the show on that. Okay? You guys.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: End it quickly!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C] Yeah. Okay, so I’m gonna–Ey! Let’s cut back to me! Aaron, thanks for coming on the show, dude! I know this is a big moment for both of us because there was a lot of fear, questions, concerns, and all that kind of stuff about what’s it entail, and I’m so appreciative that you’ve been so transparent and sharing of all the highs and the lows. I was a little shocked that you were able to talk about the money. I wasn’t sure if you’d go there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Me, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And, you just let it go, baby! It’s all out there! So guys, um, we don’t, I don’t have, um, an applause track, but thank you very much. I’m gonna close out this show. Let’s cut this thing. Let’s, let’s do…let’s try this music.

We are live today on Facebook and Youtube! Hello, beautiful people! What are we going to be talking about today? Well, before I tell you, I just want to let you guys know I miss ya and I hope you missed us, and here we are back on the livestream. But! Back by popular demand, today we are going to be talking to Aaron Atchinson, he’s the founder of Farm Design based in Pasadena, and he is one of–he’s a man who has come from humble roots. Humble beginnings, and that’s his description, not mine. Now often times when we look at successful graphic designers and successful businesses, we make the assumption that it was preordained. That everything lined up for them and that that path was inevitable. This was most definitely not the case, so you guys are gonna want to definitely stay tuned to this because we’re gonna have a conversation with Aaron. He grew up in a town of 300 people. Small town. Stick around! Roll the titles!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[RAW Titles]\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:36\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright, we’re back. Now you guys noticed I’m not in the black box. I’m sitting next to my good friend, and we are good friends. We’ve known each other for, I think somewhere close to 20 years if not longer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Aaron Atchinson]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s been awhile. It’s been awhile, so, there’s a familiarity here, and I’ve been prodding and pulling and pushing and hoping and begging for Aaron to come on the show and do it live with us, and he finally agreed, so lots of things have changed in his life, but before we do that, let’s tell everybody who you are and let’s get back and rewind the tape if you will, let’s cut to my deck.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@2:08\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: This is Aaron Atchison, and he is the Founder of Farm Design. And if you guys want to look him up, what’s the web address?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: FarmDesign.net\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Man, you sound good in that mic. Dang! Alright, anyways, you grew up in a small town called “Geraldine, Montana.” Tell me about Geraldine. What do you remember growing up there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Geraldine, Montana is in the central part of Montana, it’s a rural community, a farming community, a town (at that time, the population was 300–it’s actually, probably, maybe, far less than that now), but it was a lot of agriculture, um, built around community and the high school.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah. So there are–we have a picture of you, your brother, and your dad, you sitting on a boat in a lake somewhere, you shoveling something. What is, what are you shoveling there?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That would be grain in a grain silo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s how much I don’t know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: A grain silo. Do you have any horror stories about the grain silo?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: In the grain silo?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Normally when you hop in those things, there’s like a ton of mice running around in there and, and I don’t like mice, so, you know, so we normally let the dogs in first and the dogs sort of scare all of the mice out and then we hop in there. That’s my horror story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, so as I mentioned, you grew up in a town of 300 people, high school population of…?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: The high school, 50 kids and my graduating class had 11 kids, but we had an exchange student, so, I would say, pretty much we had 10 from the time I moved there from when I was in 5th grade ‘till the time I graduated. So it was the same (basically), the same 10 students.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, so, you go to high school and then you graduate. What did you study in school at Montana State?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I always wanted to be either a baker or an architect growing up. There was something–fascination I had with baking. I like baking pancakes in the morning, but I chose to become an architect so I went to Montana State University, which is in Bozeman, Montana, um, to study architecture initially.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And, how does one who studies architecture at Montana State wind up in California doing graphic design?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That’s interesting. I was actually born in Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh! You were?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So my brother, who’s a year older than myself, we were both born and raised in California. Uh, my mom was really young when she had two of us. Later I found out in life that she, she was 16 years old when she had two boys.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Wow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So, we actually moved around quite a bit as kids ‘cause my mom was trying to figure out where her path was and trying to just survive, and trying to figure out how to raise two young boys. So we moved around a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, we ultimately ended up (um, what I consider my hometown, which is in Montana). So we bounced around a lot, and we settled there when I was about ten years old.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah. So, um, she met a gentleman and they got married. His name is Larry Atchison, so I took on his last name.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, but yeah, I think a lot of my, sort of, experiences in life, I refer back to that time that I lived when I was in Montana.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Because I think I learned a lot of, like, discipline and a lot of the qualities that I sort of, I can attribute to growing up there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@5:14\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uh-hm. It must have been tough for you growing up because you, your mom was like in her teens…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And I imagine that there wasn’t a lot of money. You’ve told me stories about you actually having to go outside to go to the bathroom in what is referred to as an “outhouse.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@5:26\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It’s still called an “outhouse.” Yes, but, we–I…one point we lived in a house where we didn’t have running water. And so, when you don’t have running water, you don’t have plumbing, and so we had an outhouse that you had to walk (I think it was maybe a hundred yards away). Which was terrible when it was snowing because then you always, like, in the middle of the night, you have to go to the bathroom. You have to go to the bathroom and then you throw on your sneakers and your hoodie and you run out through the snow but, yeah, it was–it was tough, but you know, when you’re a kid you don’t, you don’t think about those things. It’s just, it’s just the fact of life.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Do you have any horror stories?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Horror stories?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: About going to the bathroom and there’s a raccoon?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Oh gosh, no. Nothing quite like that. I always feared there was something actually in the outhouse. Like, you know, but nothing. Nothing like that. So I–fortunately no horror stories.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Like there wasn’t a pennywise holding a red balloon in a hole and saying, “Come here!”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: No?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No. Not in the country. Yeah, clowns are smarter than that. They don’t move out in the country.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: They only hang out in suburban neighborhoods under the city. Okay, luckily for you. What–I mean, I can’t even fathom this. Look, I grew up kind of poor, too, but just not even having running water…how do you wash your hands and what does it even, how does it even work?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@6:38\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, wow. There was actually a creek, and the creek was maybe 300 yards away, and so part of growing up is my brother and I, we always had chores, and the first thing I had to do waking up in the morning was start the fire, ‘cause we didn’t have heating. We didn’t have centralized heating so, we had to like chop wood and we had to start the fire to heat the house up. So I had to wake up at (I think around) 6:30, start the fire, that was my responsibility, and then to get water, we had these um, buckets (and I think they were maybe like 3 or 4 pound buckets), and I at the time probably weighed 70 pounds soaking wet, so I was, I was tiny. And then we had to go out to the creek, then we’d have to–a little pull, and we’d pull it up, and we’d carry it back to the house so–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: A lot of hard work!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Boil water and, um, if you’ve ever seen “Hee-Haw” (which I’m kind of dating myself), like, there are scenes in there where they would bathe and they were sitting there in like a big, um, stainless steel, um, bucket, and they’re bathing themselves with a ladle. That’s how we literally bathed. And we didn’t do it all the time because it was, it took a lot of effort, so, um, we, oftentimes we bathed once a week. It was very challenging! But it was, it was just the way of life! And it was like, you didn’t know any different. It was, it was actually pretty cool.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@7:55\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It sounds a little bit like now from thinking about it, it sounds like camping. So for the first part of your life, you were just camping all the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: We were, yeah. We were always camping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C] Was it fun?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was a lot of fun! You know, it was uh, ‘cause there was a creek that ran out in front of a house that we lived in and we’d go out and we would go fishing and we’d bring the fish back in and that what we’d have for dinner. And we’d cook it right then and there. Um, so, yeah. And you were outside a lot and there’s animals, and I’m an animal person, so we had horses and cows and dogs and yeah, it was just, being outside and exploring. When you’re a kid, you’re just constantly, you’re curious and you’re exploring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@8:31\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. Let’s get you to California. And we’re gonna speed up the timeline here a little bit because I really do want to get into some of the mindset stuff that we’re going to talk about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@8:38\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You’re in California now, what brings you out to California?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@8:42\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: You know, okay, so, I went to Montana State University initially to study architecture. Um, I still had family here in California so, um, during the summers I would normally go and visit them and um, they would take us to like Disneyland and uh, then I was introduced to surfing, so, during the summers I would surf as much as possible. Um, but I really made the big transition when I discovered–at the time I didn’t know what it was called, but it was graphic design. Graphic design I had no idea what it was, I didn’t really know what a logo was, um, growing up in the country, they’re just, you’re not exposed to a lot of media.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, so when I was at the university, there was like these, some wacky kids, uh, at a department next to the architecture department, and they were doing some wacky stuff, and they were putting stuff on the walls, and I’d walk past their, um, their uh, studio space and I’d poke my head in and one day they were painting pizza boxes and it really piqued my interest. I’m like, “What are they painting pizza boxes for?” I walked in there and they were telling me they were designing logos and boxes, so I wanted to learn more, and it sparked my interest because I liked the simplicity and how impactful a logo and packaging could be. So that sort of led me to my next career path as um, or, in school rather is, I decided I’m going to move to California, change majors, mainly so I can surf in California, and then I, uh, I went to Cal State University, Northridge, uh, where I studied art with an emphasis in graphic design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@10:17\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Now, I’m going to spare you guys all the kind of details but, you started out in, in your home studio doing design and you’ve been doing that for quite some time. Now you and I met under kind of strange circumstances. I’m gonna let the guys know out in the audience here. We met through a mutual friend, a former employee of mine who said like, “I know you love to play Halo, Chris, so come and I’m gonna bring my buddy in. “And I know you’re a super competitive guy, I won’t get into all the juicy details, but we would all bring our X-Boxes together and, and do a LAN party and play Halo together. And that’s really how I got to know you. And I remember, there’s a couple times we wanted to play, so I would just grab my X-Box and go meet you up at your house and we’d plug the things in. I–we would go into one room and we’d have these LAN parties and just do battle for lunch and unplug and just run back to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And I didn’t know you that well at the time. You were just that guy in the other room that I just wanted to kill. And so Halo is like one of those sports like–and you were probably equally as competitive. And so, I would come visit my friend and I would come to your office and you guys would actually print out sort of like…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Floorplans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Floorplans of the maps of Halo and you guys were strategizing. You had like rulers and lines, like you’d go here and here. I’m like, “This guy is intense.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Isn’t that how everybody plays Halo?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No, just you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: We weren’t going to lose, so that’s really how we got our start, but as our kind of casual friendship built up around gaming and just competing, and then I started to learn more about you and your design practice, and I’m gonna get you guys to 2008 a little bit right now. Okay? So let’s look at 2008. This is the studio in which you worked out of?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, I…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Talk to us about this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@11: 56\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, just, uh, after I graduated college, um, I got a job as a creative director at a small agency in Culver City, here in Los Angeles. So I worked there for 5 years. Um, I sort of cut my teeth sort of learning the principles of design, and working with clients, and, uh, working with vendors. I, I learned a lot. It was, it was uh, a fantastic experience in my life. In 2000 I decided I was gonna, I was gonna branch out and I was gonna do my own thing and so I had a spare bedroom in my apartment, um, and so I converted that spare bedroom into my studio, if you will, and really it was just a computer on a desk. Um, I, I was, I had enough confidence in my ability and skill level and I had some relationships and I had some small clients, so I’m like: “Okay, I’m going to take that leap of faith.” I had a little bit of money in the bank account (I think, uh, at that time, I had literally 9,000 dollars in my account), so I said–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s pretty good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was pretty good! I figured that I could live without any income coming in for three months and so I kind of had a time scale, like, “Okay, if this is going to happen, I, I gotta make it happen in three months.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And how old are you at this point? Do you remember?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, I was exactly 30. It was on my 30th birthday, I’m like, “I’m leaving.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Wow. Okay. And what year is this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was 2000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh, 2000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: 2000.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Well, interesting. Alright, I’m trying to map your timeline, as to kind of, well…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I took the 7-year plan in, in college if you’re doing the math. But, yeah…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@13:23\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, let’s look at some of the work. So it makes sense to hear your story about your love of surfing and outdoors and just be, you’re kind of into sports and you’re an athlete and competition, and this is kind of…\u003cbr/\u003e[A] Yeah, that’s where my passion was.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385c3cdbce3e_AaronAtchison_work1.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, this is a time capsule into kind of the work that you were doing. And I remember talking to you at this point in time, and, I’m going to tell a little story you guys. So here’s my, here’s my story. I’m over at Aaron’s house and he’s showing me the work that he’s doing and he’s talking about doing work with new clients, and I remember you were showing me this very ornate packaging you were putting together. I remember this, and you were going to ship this to whatever, or self-promo pieces, and I had asked you at this time, “Aaron, why don’t you get an intern in here to do this? There’s somebody else that could be doing this while you do the high-level stuff.” And I remember your response. Do you remember it, or should I tell this part?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, I didn’t listen to you much back then, so, you were my mortal enemy, so, no.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: How am I your–?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Refresh my memory.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Hold on. How am I your mortal enemy?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I do remember you telling me I should do a lot of things to improve what I, my practice, right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Basically it was me giving you valuable advice that just hit you like a rock and fell on the floor, at that time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Pretty much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@14:33\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Your response to me was: “Hey, Chris. If I don’t do this, what else am I going to be doing? And, I don’t know, I’m just a simple guy, I just want to do the work, I see something that needs to get done and I just do it. Why would I hire anybody else to do this? What else am I gonna do?” And I remember telling you, “Well, you should be working on your business and not in your business. Be thinking about how to grow and scale.” And do you remember that now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I do remember and I think a lot of those, um, the way I was brought up growing up on a farm is like you’d…work had to be done, you just rolled, rolled your sleeves up and you got out there and you did the work. And so, when I started my practice, I still had that sort of mindset where things had to be done (I knew how to do them), and so I just rolled my sleeves up and did it. You were always, you were always sort of, kind of like that uncle that always wanted to like give me advice and I, I think I was pretty stubborn back then (still a little stubborn).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I just want to say for the record: A younger uncle, please.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Perhaps, perhaps.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Don’t paint me into that picture. Just a younger uncle. The younger, cooler uncle. Keep going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: But when you said, uh, back when I first started my practice and you saw me sort of doing all these little, little tasks when you said, “You need, you should outsource that, or you should get someone to help you.” Uh, for me, I was not afraid of hard work, so I kinda didn’t understand your principles. I also was always concerned that I would be giving away something…um, I always wanted to be close to my craft, and I always, I love designing and having my hands on things and working, so, for me it’s like it didn’t feel like work so it didn’t feel like I was, I needed to give away anything. I wasn’t that busy all the time anyway, and I think that to your point is, so, it’s like, “Well I have the extra time and if I didn’t have extra time, I would just stay up later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So that was always just, that was my mentality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, so some people are guessing correctly how old Aaron is. I’m not going to tell you, but you can do the math. Now, I remember also talking to you because you would work really hard, and I’m, I would never accuse you of not working hard, but maybe I would accuse you of not working as smart as you need to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And I remember then, for periods of time you would just disappear. You would disappear and go surfing in Costa Rica, and you’d go on these epic adventures, meanwhile I was toiling away kind of in the factory, if you will. I remember saying this to you one time, I was like: “Aaron, I think you suffer from ‘Peter Pan’ syndrome. Like, you never want to grow up. You’re still doing projects–” (now, we’re in our 40s at this point, I think).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No, we’re in our late thirties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Late thirties?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Careful, we were in our thirties.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: We’re in our late thirties, and I was telling you, “Like, you work on projects that I think 18, 19, 22-year-old kids would love to work on.” Uh, action, sports-oriented things and brands, and I remember you working on certain events that was kind of like–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Like X-Games type of stuff. Yeah, absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And, the other part to it was not only just reflected in the clients that you were working with and the things that connected and resonated with you, but, this idea that you would work and then you would disappear. You would just plan these trips and you would just disappear, and, and, and you liked the idea that you could pick up and go wherever you wanted, kind of in this more “transitory-transient” lifestyle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And, I said to you, “One day, when you want to focus on your business, your life will change and it will change for the better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And what was your thought?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think that my thought process during those, those years–I think–and it was right around from 2000 and 2008 was when I was a solo, solo designer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: “Solopreneur.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@18:02\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: “Solopreneur,” sort of working out my, my, my practice out of my home. My, my philosophy at the time was: I have skill and I’m willing to work hard, and, I had a certain level of success early on. I had certain clients and I would look at the bank account and I’d see the money coming in and, and it was pretty decent. You know? It was anywhere between 50 thousand to 90 thousand–was probably one of my best years. So that’s where the range was, and for me that was really good. And so I had this philosophy: I’m gonna–as long as I’m hitting a certain number, then whatever time I have leftover, I’m gonna experience things in life. So I would travel, um, so yeah. It was very much sort of a, sort of a “fixed” mindset. I wasn’t looking at [the] “big picture,” I was sort of “living in the now,” and I would look at your career and I saw you working so hard, like, always working, and I was the antithesis of that. I’m like, “Chris, why aren’t you enjoying life? Have you ever traveled out of the country?” And you were like, “There will be a time for that.” And I thought you were crazy. I’m like, “I’m not gonna be young for the rest of my life. I want to experience these things while I can still move.” And, so that was my philosophy. So–and it worked for me for a while, you know? I was like, I was getting clients, the money was okay, I was able to support myself. Um…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: But before we get into that, I want to dwell on this for a little bit because the reason why–and some of you guys that are tuning in or watching this later will realize really quickly–the reason why I brought Aaron on the show was because he can speak to and relate to so many things that you guys think. So here we are: We’re two contrasting personalities. You, you come–we’re both, we, we came out of the world kinda poor, and we worked our way out of it, but you came from a really small town, some financial hardships, and some, some family life that was less than ideal, but you worked through all that stuff, right? You made it work, and–but there was this idea of you just wanting to be (this is where we differ) this “solopreneur,” doing the work yourself and doing it all by yourself, and having great pride in being able to do it, and then saying, “What’s wrong with you? Why don’t you want to enjoy your life and I can’t see that. You’re like probably just grinding away at the, in the salt mine, kind of in the cubicle, if you will,” even though I didn’t work in a cubicle. And on the flipside, I’m over here thinking, “This guy has so much potential. He could do so many things but he just needs to learn to grow up at some point in his life.” And I’m just using it in the broadest sense, like, you’re a mature person, but I was just thinking: “Why doesn’t your work evolve? Like, my work doesn’t look the same as it did just a few years ago, let alone when I was in my 20s. I needed to do work that was going to be appealing to companies that could afford to pay me what I wanted to be paid.” I just want to get a little bit of your mindset. How you viewed yourself versus me and just, this is your opportunity to just dog on me if you want (at that point in time).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@21:01\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah. I, I think…I, I think a lot of my motivation was: “I’m just gonna work hard.” And that’s where it came from my childhood and growing up on a farm, it was like, “That’s gonna get me through tough times. It’s like, just the solution is just to work really hard.” And, and I did–I wasn’t looking very, sort of, proactively, like, “What’s gonna happen long-term?” Uh, because I had a certain level of success early on, um, branching out as a solopreneur, I thought that was it, like, it was just things were gonna happen and materialize and it was just gonna happen. I was just a lot of–a lot of things were very reactive, um, where the clients came in, um, and how I adjusted with those clients, but, it wasn’t until, you know, I fell on some hardships where it made me sort of reanalyze who I was as a person, uh, especially at that time in my life where, uh, now I’m in my late 30s, I, I expected a, you know, a certain level of success and, and comfort, and, you know, having stability and um, finances, stability in sort of my relationships and really, I started to uncover that I didn’t have a lot of these things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And that’s when there was that, that “oh crap” moment, and um, that sort of come-to-Jesus, like, “Uh, maybe I do need to grow up.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@22:14\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well let’s talk about that. So this is where I think we wanted to kind of pivot and we can circle back, you guys, if you want to ask those question on Facebook and on YouTube that we have two guys in the other room, along with Erica, Emmanuel, and Sam (two interns joining us here). So they’ll be monitoring your comments and you guys lets me know if you hear a really good question, okay? Feel free, feel free to interrupt us. Let’s talk about this point of, of change in your life. What happened here? So, I think if you guys were paying attention, if you were alive during this time in 2008, basically the, the bottom of the universe opened up as far as it’s concerned with the financial market. People were committing suicide, stocks (like Apple stock was like at 18 dollars a share), everybody thought the total economy was going to collapse and it impacted so many businesses (ours, too). And so let’s, let’s talk a little bit about 2018, uh 2008.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@23:02\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, so I think my, my business and myself was really just kind of on cruise-control, and things were fine, you know, there was money in the bank and, um, I was living the life I wanted to live. I had a lifestyle that I enjoyed, and then I think it was around 2007 is when the, the housing market sort of burst and the stock market went kind of, kind of went bonkers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: The subprime…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Right? And what happened is, clients, the phone stopped ringing, and that was when, um, I saw the bank account starting to dwindle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: How much was in the bank account at this point in time?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: You know, I, I think I was always right around anywhere from 5 to 20 thousand dollars?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And–but that was fine when money was continually coming through, but then once the phone stopped ringing, uh, I had to re-evaluate what was happening. Um, I think a lot of my clients, uh, they would keep the work in-house now because their marketing budgets were a lot tighter.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Uh, companies or start-ups who were thinking about bringing something to market, they didn’t have that luxury anymore.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: They didn’t have financing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Banks didn’t loan any money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, and so there was just, absolutely nothing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, money dried up all over the place and I think I remember, too, two of your bigger clients in the action-sports space, they had problems financially, too, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, I think, uh, in the action-sports industry, I did a lot of, um, lifestyle brands, um, action-sports and their sponsors stopped sponsoring the events, and so, those events just, they just disappeared. Another big client I had at the time I had a retainer with (Honda motorcycles), and so retainer is they, they had a one-year contract and I would get paid monthly, so it was kinda like a salary, so it was that stability. Um, they stopped having work because they then tightened-up their budget and kept everything in-house, and so then that was that moment where I needed to figure out what to do next.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@25:01\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well this kind of stuff doesn’t happen overnight. There’s a slow progression or, it might feel like it happens overnight, but–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It felt like it happened overnight.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right. Like, one client calls you and says, “Aaron, it’s been great working with you, but we can’t do this anymore.” There goes Honda. The action sports guys say, “We can’t do the next event this year, all our sponsors pulled out.” And, slowly but surely you start to see that 20 thousand become 18, becomes 12, becomes 8…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And so talk to me. When did it hit rock bottom for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It, it was pretty quick. Um, I knew that (I mean), I probably started living beyond my means (‘cause I had a nice car)–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@25:37\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And I, I was more concerned about status and what people thought of me, so I, I kind of was–had a certain lifestyle that I was used to living. Eating out, dressing a certain way, um, and so when I couldn’t afford to do those things, and the money wasn’t coming in, that’s when I’m like: “Okay, what do I do now? Do I, do I actually brush off my résumé and look for another job?” And I had a lot of pride because I sort of had a certain level of success with Farm Design and, um, I’d built something. To feel like I had to let that go and, you know, suck up my pride and go on interviews again, it was really tough. And I actually did that. I had to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You, you put together your resume.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I put together my portfolio, I put–uh, I rewrote my résumé, um, this is my late 30s now and I was going to, I went to a couple job interviews and I never got the work. I’m like, “Wait, wait a minute. I thought my stuff was pretty good.” But, they weren’t hiring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Why do you think that was?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think everyone was starving. Everyone was hungry, everyone was looking for work. Uh, they had to be über selective about who they picked because, you know, they probably had limited resources as well and maybe I just didn’t fit. I think also maybe my portfolio was very one-dimensional, but that worked for me in terms of my business model. I focused heavily on, uh, an action-sports sort of “youth-lifestyle” sort of. That’s who I appealed to, those are the type of clients I appealed to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: How did that make you feel?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@27:13\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Uh, pretty inferior, actually. Um, it, it, it made me think and it kept me up late at night, uh, just wondering like okay, what did I do wrong? Um, you know. The fear of, “Can I make my car payment? Can I, can I pay for rent? What is my girlfriend gonna think?” It’s, it’s those sort of things, like, it can emasculate you, so, yeah. I think, you know, I–that was the time when I like, really hit rock bottom. It wasn’t fun. It was scary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I can, I can only imagine. I mean, even the act of putting together your résumé, not as a design exercise, but because you actually have to go out and get work, that just must have been hard to say, like, “Okay, it was a good run. It’s been 8 or so years and it’s been great, and now I have to change and everything is changing and…did you start to regret some of the decisions that you made prior to that point? Because sometimes when you’re in that dark place–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: –you ask, “Why did I buy that expensive car? What, why did I not take that opportunity, or there was that one client that I could have done something different from but I walked away ‘cause I was too or what. I don’t know what it was. I’m just…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, I don’t think I regretted the decisions I made with my business. I, I look back at it as a learning experience, like, “Okay, I probably should have done something different. Um, I, I certainly (I think with a lot of people) lived beyond my means.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, having a nice car and living a certain way, and at the end of the day, what does that all really mean? It’s, it’s superficial. And it took sort of hitting that rock-bottom to start to see those things, and re-evaluate and, um, assess who I was and, and if I needed to change my mindset to sort of right the ship because everything was, like, the business, the accounting, the–my relationships, it was like, it all kind of like came to a head.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Did it cause friction in your relationship?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It certainly didn’t help. Yeah. Um, because we split all of the–at the time, I was in a long relationship as well, and I think I wasn’t–probably it was a 15-year relationship\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And so, why didn’t I commit to that person, so I think there was a lot of things I didn’t want to grow up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So, you know, that whole “Peter Pan” syndrome thing. It, it affected everything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: If the label fits you well. I know you resented me even throwing that at you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I didn’t even know what that meant when you brought it up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I made it up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Peter Pan. Peter Pan never grows up!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That was me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Wow, okay, so if you guys want to get the razor blades out, now would be a good time to actually put them away ‘cause we’re gonna, we’re gonna pivot. There’s a reason why Aaron is here. I wanted him, and I’ve encouraged him to just kind of open his heart and share some of the pain points there because what happens next, I think we can learn a lot from. Now if we had a commercial break, this is when I would cut to a commercial break, but we don’t, so we’re gonna keep going!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: That’s how we roll. Okay, so I’m gonna bring up this slide here, and I remember you doing this (I have my thoughts and opinions on this as well), but you started another business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Let me, let me just set the stage and then you, you take it from there. So, so here you are, you can’t get clients because you actually didn’t build a sales pipeline or sales or marketing strategy and all the things that you had done in the past, are no longer applicable because there are too many buyers and too few sellers. Oh, I’m sorry, let me say that the opposite: There are too few buyers and too many sellers of work, and so, you went out and tried to get a job. You did the whole resume dog-and-pony show and you weren’t able to get the work either, so now it’s like, what does a person do? And you got pushed into a pretty tight corner. This is when you started a company called “Mugo,” a portable MP3 music player–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yep.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: –that was kind of tapping into a big trend, and the trend was custom-vinyl-artwork, built around artists that have a following. Right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Take it away from there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@31:03\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, I, I think when I, when I was at that place in my career, I…I, I had to make a decision: Do I just bury my head in the sand and just, you know, did I fail or do I try to learn from my mistakes and do something with it? And when the opportunities weren’t knocking, they say to build a door and so because no one else was calling me, that I felt like I needed to create my own opportunities. Um, I took a lot of the lessons, uh, I realized I learned a lot, design, doing branding for my clients in helping them build something. Seeing their vision come to fruition. Um, so I’m like, “Well I need to take the lessons that I have, the skills that I have, the foundation and do that for myself.” So I was very passionate about music and collecting vinyl toys, which, you know, I think I probably got a lot from you because you collect a lot of vinyl toys as well and I think I got that inspiration and I, I created this thing called a “Mugo” and what my goal was to bring a product to market. I didn’t know what I was doing. It was all just by the seat of my pants. Um, literally, uh, designed something, um, try to figure out how to find, uh, vendors and manufacturers. I knew that I needed to go to China because looking for local vendors, it was too expensive and the price-point wasn’t right, so like, how do I find vendors in Asia? And then, so a lot of this stuff was incredibly reactive, but I had a goal, like I needed to create another sort of income source. I’m gonna create my own business, separate from branding. And that’s what Mugo was. Um, and that was probably a two-year “labor of love,” getting that thing. Trying to get it off the ground.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, and then, sort of, in the middle, there’s occasionally those small little projects that might come in, but I was, I was–that whole time–I was, everything was running on fumes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I remember.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I remember. So sometimes…a wise friend could come in and offer you advice, and you would ignore it because of our competitive spirit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@33:07\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And then, sometimes life sends you another message, knocking at your door, and pulls the rug out from underneath you, and you can’t attribute these…the “global forces at work,” if you will–this whole “subprime market,” it just “bottomed-out” as something that is a consequence of your action, things just do happen, but then it’s in those moments you learn that, “Oh, we didn’t prepare that emergency earthquake kit. Oh, snap! Now we gotta go do something about it.” And you tried one thing after the other, and, where is it in this part of your journey is it that you start to make these kind of fundamental changes that lead you to kinda where we’re gonna take this conversation in a little bit. What happened? Can you, can you remember? What were the triggers and how did your mindset change? Because so much of what we try to teach on this show is about “mindset.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@33:57\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah. I, I think one thing that I took from my childhood, and my, my growing up on a farm and an agricultural community is, uh, my father always taught us to, sort of, “feed the soil and not the plant.” And it was a very literal uh, um, lesson that he was trying to teach us. And what that, what that meant was, in, in order for the crop to thrive is you really need to put your focus on the soil. And, so, he taught us how to fertilize the soil, how to do crop rotation, so all of these things it was, was putting the focus on, on a foundation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@34:35\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And, and if you focus on the foundation, then that crop will thrive and you’ll be sustainable. If you, if you lose focus on that foundation or the soil in this metaphor, um that’s, that plant will eventually wither and die. So, when I was going through this transition, I, I was–uh–reminded of that lesson and, and used it as a metaphor that I think what I had spent so much of my time focusing on was, like myself and what I thought other people, um, wha–the importance of what they thought of me, the type of car I drove, the type of clothes I wore–and I focus more I guess on the plant, and I didn’t focus on the foundation. So, I shifted, needed to shift in my mindset to, um, thinking in a belief system that is more long-term and more foundational. So by developing something like creating my own product as something that, um, I can put a lot of the, the work into creating it. But then that would have sort of long-term effects in terms of sales, and the lessons that I learned from that I can parlay that into other opportunities. Um, and I think that’s what truly happened when I, when I started to do that–is that other opportunities came out through this experience. Uh, opportunities that I didn’t even foresee, but um, but then I sort of grasped those opportunities, and I think that’s when things started to happen. The big shift was, in conjunction with Mugo ‘cause I had to fund that and I had to just survive, is I needed to decide like, “How am I going to grow my business?” if that’s what I wanted to do. And I was reminded of, of what you always told me is like, I think there was, there was someone you met. There was a kid you met at a portfolio review and you called me up and you said, “Hey, there’s this kid, you know, he’s, he’s okay. I, I liked his energy. Give him a call. Um, try him out as an intern. Just give him one day a week.” And, you know, at that point, it’s like, I have nothing to lose. And so, I actually listened to you that time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: The one time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: The one time–or maybe the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, the first time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@36:44\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was the first time. And so, uh, I called him, he came in and I interviewed him, and his portfolio was, you know, it was average, but I, I did like his energy, and so I said, “Okay, I’m gonna take this leap of faith, I don’t know how I’m gonna pay for this kid, you know, it was 10 dollars an hour, and so I said, “Well, what if I, if I fed you lunch everyday, too, would, does that sound appealing?” And he said–he was as hungry as I was. So I, I hired him, and I said, “Let’s come in, let’s try two days a week.” And he didn’t have a vehicle, and he drove a bus, it took him 2 to 2 and a half hours just to get to my place, so I knew that he was really passionate and hungry as well. So what I started to see is this, what I thought as like, maybe this kid can help me with small little tasks and errands, is what it did is it really sort of lit a fire and it re-sort of, um, brought the passion back and the energy for my craft as a designer because, uh, he would come in and I would give him tasks and I would teach him certain things and I could see the look on his face when I would teach him these things, and, and that sort of, sort of fueled my fire, and then, surprisingly what I did not expect, is he taught me a lot of things–’cause I had way too much pride. I thought I knew everything. I thought I knew everything. But he taught me a lot of things, and that’s when I sort of had a really big pivot point in my career and my life and um, looking at myself like, you know, maybe I don’t know everything. Maybe I need to re-look at this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@38:15\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I-I look at my career when I was a, a solopreneur, and I look at it as, as I was a–really a small plant in a small pot. I was this one guy in my apartment, working in this little room, wake up and I’d go to the room and I’d do my work. I was a plant in a small pot, and what I needed to do was focus on that foundation and, and grow that foundation, so I needed to get a bigger pot, so I could allow sort of my roots to grow. So, I got another computer, um, I got another workstation, I got the intern and we started doing stuff and things started happening. I didn’t know what it was, but I just knew something was different.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm. Okay. Let’s hold that thought for a second here. I want to que up Emmanuel and Sam and, and Erica. If you guys have any questions, get your questions ready. I just want to read some comments from the livechat. People are saying: (This is Akman Raw–I don’t know how to say your name, but he’s like) “I’ve learned so much within the last 30 minutes.” So thank you for saying that. People are saying, “This is amazing.” Uh, “Salut.” “Teach and learn, Farm Design.” Uhh, “Amazing, you guys.” “Check it out.” “Mind blown.” So some good energy coming in. I wanted to share that with you so you could feel some of the audience feedback. Uh, uh I have tons of thoughts and ideas and questions to kind of dive in, but I’mma kick it out to the new dream team. New dream team, you got any questions or comments about this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Emmanuel] We have a question from Lallitz Gallery, umm, he’s asking, “How does a solopreneur handle his/her company during a recession?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I think you’re hearing it right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I believe you’re exactly hearing the story of how a solopreneur handles their company during a recession. And we’re gonna talk a little bit more about that so let’s okay, that’s a good question. Anything else? Anything? You guys can ask your own question, you guys. As you’re listening to the story, both of you guys are graphic designers. Emmanuel, raise your hand so people know who you are. So Emmanuel’s from, from, from Italy. From Milan?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, so, it’s ironic that you’re here and I’ll be going to Milan in a couple of weeks. That’s kind of weird. You come and I–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: I’ve been waiting for you for ages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I’m sorry. And then Sam. Sam’s from Art Center, right? You’re studying graphic design. What, what term and major are you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Sam]: Um, I’m about 8th term at Art Center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh! You’re about to graduate.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: Yeah. So, haha. Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, any questions so far, you guys? As you’re hearing Aaron just pour his heart out here, just on the table and the floor! You got anything for us? Erica, I, I hear, I hear you smiling and laughing in the background, so, what’s, what’s resonating and what’s connecting with you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Erica]: Uh, well mostly I’m focusing on the edit…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: But, it is really great to hear a story, um, of how someone got started and the troubles they went through, and how they realized their mindset, and I’m looking forward to, to more of it, even though half of my attention is mostly on the edit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, okay. But I, I hear your smiling and laughing at the key moments. Uh, when I make my little jokes and insert the jabs, so I, I know you’re paying attention. Okay. Anyways, people are wondering what happened to Aaron and Molly. Are they gone forever? And yes, they are gone forever. Or have they been shipped off to another country? No, they’re in the other room, working very hard, you guys. Just relax. We’re bringing in lots of different kinds of people, different energy for the topics that are relevant to them and what they’re passionate about. So let’s talk a little bit about this, so, before we kind of just broke away for a moment from the story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@41:39\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You’re kind of in this dark place. You don’t know what else to do. So you wind up bringing in somebody to help you. And I have to imagine, because I think we had these conversations before, and this is gonna touch upon a lot of what our audience is gonna feel. So when you’re not successful, you feel like, “Well who am I to take on people and to mentor? Like, I’m not even worthy of doing that. And, I’m barely making it as it is, financially. How can I afford to bring in another person? What are they gonna do for me? I don’t have any work to do, what the heck are they gonna do?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right? Does that sound about fair?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It’s pretty fair.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, now so despite all that, you finally, finally let some words of wisdom trickle into the thick skull. And you actually do bring in a kid. You bring in a kid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@42:22\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And it was very generous of you, actually, because a lot of people do unpaid internships, and for you even to say, “Look, I, I, I’ll pay you hourly and then I’ll buy your lunch,” because you’re a good guy. So if you have a loaf of bread, I think you’re the type of guy who doesn’t just cut half and give it to his employee. You cut whatever you think the employee needs and you eat the crumbs that are leftover. So kudos to you, you’re a good, you’re a good man, Charlie Brown. You are. Okay? So you bring in a guy and you start to learn how to delegate. You learn how to collaborate. You learn how to manage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@42:55\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And most importantly, you’re, you’re teaching and you’re sharing what you know. And this is what they, they always say (like, teachers say this and it’s a cliché, but it’s totally true): “You learn more from the student than they will ever learn from you.” And, and I wanna explain that a little bit, but I don’t want to explain it. I want you to do it. Like, what do you mean when you say that, like, you didn’t realize you would learn so much by actually having somebody that you were gonna teach?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@43:21\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think it’s interesting…um, teaching someone things that you know. First of all, I really didn’t think I knew that much. I think I had certain levels of skill, but I say, “If you’ve been paying attention in life, you should’ve, you should learn something.” And so, having someone there where you can bounce ideas off and, and share information you realize, um, how much you actually do know. And then it starts a conversation. And that conversation stimulates and challenges each other, and I think that’s what it, it–one of the challenges of working by yourself is, “Who’s there to challenge yourself?” It’s like, do you have that intern–, that internal sort of voice that, that can do it for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@44:02\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So, having an intern or a student there who can, that can challenge you on your thoughts, who can bring new, uh, dialogue and information to the table, I think is what really started to, um, where I started to grow up as a person…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A] And made me want to learn more so I can share more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And so, we started with that collaboration. Between the two of us, uh, I, I think, I felt like I was becoming a better person and more knowledgeable, and I could see him, he was always there on time, everyday, the front door, ready to go, to, to the next task and so, that just sparked the fuel even more, and like, “Okay, where do I take this? What’s the next step?” And so I brought in another intern because the work started picking up. Um, and so I brought in another person. At that point I, I had moved and I had a house…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And, um…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So we’re gonna, we’re gonna talk. We’re gonna do the transition talk right now? Is that right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Roughly, but I think it’s, it’s important because, uh, I, I had a garage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So, I moved out of the apartment with the spare bedroom and I now had a house with a garage…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@45:19\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And a yard. And, I put in more computers. And so I’m like: “Okay.” I felt comfortable bringing that one person on. So little baby steps, little progressions, sort of, uh, scaffolding my, uh, my efforts and, and trying to build for something greater. Uh, I didn’t want to jump in head-first. I was doing little baby steps, but at least I was moving forward with the goal that I needed to do something where I can be sustainable and something that I can have to grow my business, and um, and my career. So I hired another employee. Um, it was my–it started out as an internship, uh, she was fantastic, and so I offered her a job after a few months.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: But we were in the garage! And, it was difficult–I was surprised that she took the job offer because it’s like, this person who just graduated school, who I thought was incredibly talented, why would she want to come and work in my garage? So she saw something, I think in me, perhaps? I think she saw something in, in my vision, like how I wanted to grow the business, and so I needed to get that bigger pot, and so I took another leap of faith, and I got an office space in Old Town Pasadena. So, it scared me to death because now I have more expenses, more overhead, I have to pay for rent and utilities, and more computers, and the salary, um, so, it’s, it’s pushing me out of my comfort zone is really what allowed me to start to grow and, and, um, mature as an individual, and mature as a business owner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm. Okay, so, we’re gonna cut to my slides here. This is where Aaron’s office is now, right on the main strip in Old Town Pasadena. It’s right on Colorado. He’s right there above the Vans shoe store.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Vans Shoes and…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah. And something else.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It’s that second floor there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And Lush. And you can see him on the second floor there with the orange lights. And I’m gonna show you guys a little about his office space. And he’s gone through some expansion. Uh, you’ve knocked out some walls and kind of moved–opened up your office, and soon, I think, you’ll probably outgrow that office, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right? That’s a probability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That pot is probably…I’m out growing that pot, and so I’ll probably need to get a bigger pot. So, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, it needs to just continue to grow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So here, you can see Aaron with his dog, Shelly?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Shelby.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Shelby! And, and some of his staff. Alright. And now we’re gonna look at some of his work…I know the Internet is really smart, so all our fans are probably already crawling all over your Behance site or on your website itself–uh, your website proper. But let’s take a look at some of your work. So, now you’re in the food and bev space and you’re doing really well. You’re killin’ it. You’re, you’re branding some really awesome restaurants and, just, really fun “dream” projects, if you will. Doing things from (What is this?) Craft Cider, and to Cold Brew Coffee from Califa, Califia?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Calif-fee-ya?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Calif-fee-ya, thank you. And then doing coffee packaging for Static.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And some fashion stuff, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@48:22\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: You’ll start to notice that I transitioned away from youth-lifestyle, and into…um, a portfolio that can appeal to clientele that probably could afford to pay us, that I can afford to pay my staff, and so, in order for me to do that, I had to get out of my comfort zone of doing what I knew, while I needed to–we needed to craft a portfolio that can attract clients that we wanted.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And so…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I feel like I’ve heard that before. How…I can’t put my…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: …finger on it. I just…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think I came up with that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, probably. Okay, keep going.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: But I think uh, from a lot of your audience, it’s like, how do you get to that next level? How, how do you attract a certain clientele?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@49:05\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And, I, I learned this from students, is, uh, I would ask–be asked to do a lot of portfolio reviews at my alma mater at Cal. State Northridge and AIGA, and, there was always–I’d get the portfolio from the student and it would be their–they would show work from school task, and it, the projects that they were probably the most proud of were something that was actually, they, did in real life that was actually printed, but oftentimes those projects weren’t that good. It’s like: “Oh, I designed this logo and this brochure for a bank,” for example, and I’m looking at–the design is not that great, but they think it’s the best piece in their portfolio because it was actually printed, or there was an actual client. And so, I, I learned from that, that, you know,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@49:49\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I don’t think you have to show something that you actually did, I’d rather you, you show me something that’s, uh, exemplifies your capabilities and your design skills. So if that means you have to do something on your own, or if, if you’re in class and your professor gives you a project, do the project, but then go the next step, and, and expand on that project and that system, uh, for your portfolio. So from that lesson (‘cause I didn’t want to look at projects that didn’t appeal to me), so when I started, uhh, sort of “Farm Design 2.0,” and I have employees, like, we needed to like, um, attract a new clientele, so we asked ourselves, “What sort of clients do we want to attract?” And we would, we were interested in maybe doing some sort of beverage company, we liked coffee, so, and we liked restaurants, so I tasked the, um, my employees, “Okay, let’s come up with a hypothetical project, and let’s start crafting something.” So we actually put a project brief together, we, we acted like we were the clients and we needed to have parameters, so it wasn’t the wild west and just running all over the place. We needed to have parameters, and we designed things, we mocked them up, we shot them for our portfolio, we put them out there. We put it out on Dribble, we put it out on our website, and then people started calling because they liked something–a beverage project, and then they had a beverage project themselves. And so we started getting clients based on the work that we were putting out there. So we weren’t waiting for clients to come to us, we were like, “Okay, we need to put something out there, you know, put a little bait in the water for them to bite and so we could bring them in. We have to craft something.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Uh, a good example is, uhh, we…we, I! I had an opportunity for a restaurant branding project. Honestly, I don’t remember how the guy found us, he was gonna do a pizza shop, and that was extremely exciting. It would have been our first restaurant project. He came in–and this is when we first opened our office in Pasadena, we didn’t have a lot of furniture, we didn’t have anything on the walls, it was like, I was like: “Oh my God! I, we have to look professional!” So we were actually printing stuff out and putting them on the wall like we were like super busy. He came into the office and, and we would pretend like we were really busy and we did the dog-and-pony show, and he, I thought for sure we got the project. And he didn’t call us back. And I was like, that was our opportunity to get into the restaurant business. But because we didn’t get that project, I’m like, “Okay, guys. We need to create that hypothetical restaurant project.” And we took that as an opportunity, and we put that on the Internet, and then we started getting calls to do restaurant projects. But I think that only works if you do good work. It can’t be mediocre work. Otherwise, you’re going to probably get mediocre clients.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I don’t think anybody wants medio–mediocre work, period. Even mediocre clients don’t want mediocre work. Let me, let me ask you a couple of questions. So you’re fussing about doing this artwork, trying to create the appearance and the facade that you’re a happening studio, and then you don’t get the work. Any other reasons why you don’t think you got the work?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@52:55\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think there wasn’t a certain polish. I still was sort of refining sort of our, our game in terms of, “How do we sell our skills?” Look, “Who are we?” We were still trying to define who we were, um, so I think they didn’t have necessarily confidence in our ability. We probably didn’t have that body of work yet, um, to sort of lean against, um, so I think there was, there was two-fold. Um, did they have the, the trust in our ability to put–to do something? And, do you have something to support that, that I can see? They like case studies.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah. I’m gonna mention a couple of things, ‘cause, I want to fill in some of the gaps for our audience. I remember talking to you about this and, and, and I think I’m glad that you’ve ultimately had made those changes, but I remember looking at your portfolio. So now you, you have your foot half into this other world (we’ll just call it the “adult world”), and half of the other foot in the youthful action-sports-lifestyle brand world. And I think even at this point (‘cause you and I, we’ve had so many conversations, especially when you still lived in Santa Monica), we’d go out to lunch, first it would be once a week, and then twice a week, and it seemed like we’re having lunch every single day. And I was just meeting up with you, we would chat, basically, just trying to help a friend level-up his business game, which is something I felt really good about. But I remember seeing like really beautiful, mature typography and work for real estate clients, and some beautiful identity design work that was in conflict with this other (if you guys remember back to surf brands, those kind of stuff he was doing), it was diametrically opposed in look and tone. So I, I don’t know if I articulated that clearly to you at that point in time. You do need to make a choice. Because it’s, it’s kind of schizophrenic. People show up at your site, they’re gonna see something or they’re gonna ask themselves: “Which designer am I getting? Am I getting the more sophisticated, mature person who can understand big businesses? Or do I want that youthful, edgy energy?” And I think at that point you weren’t quite ready to let that go, but ultimately you did, and you started to change portfolios. So, a recurring theme here–that I’m gonna try to do my best to articulate is your ability to look in the moment, and make some really hard decisions that seem to go against every fiber of your being. We trace it back to “I just want to do the work,” “I have great pride and ownership,” “I think it’s good–and it’s ethical for me to do the work,” and then to let that go, to let that go and it transformed you. Then to take on more employees and then to make a big commitment. Anybody that’s been out there who has had to sign a lease, it’s like a 3-year lease, you’re making a commitment–a promise to pay somebody else rent that you’re not sure if you’re going to be able to do for the next 3 years. That is a big “gut-check” moment. And you’re doing all these things (you call them “small, scaffolding steps”), but really, they’re giant commitments internally that you have to get over. And to also let go of some of the past to make room for the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And you did all that and I, I–kudos to you. It took you awhile (I, I always say, like, you would be ten times big and successful if you just moved a little faster), but you’re, you’re super successful now, and I want to show a little bit more of your work. But, there’s another thing that I want to talk about here and you’ve mentioned it a couple of times so I feel that I need to point it out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@56:00\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: When Hugh Barton was on here, the psychotherapist, he talked about the difference between “self-confidence” and “self-esteem.” I’ve never heard this before explained this way (and I hope I don’t butcher this prat): “self-confidence” is how you feel about you and your work when nobody is around; “self-esteem” is how you feel when other people are around. And I think they’re one and the same because you truly cannot be self-confident if you don’t have the self-esteem. Well, why is that? Because you had mentioned twice now that you brought in this superstar designer, and you weren’t sure if she would want to work with you because you’re working out of your garage. So I’ve never suffered from that because I always thought, “I have a lot to share, and the work is going to be really good.” Don’t worry about the Ikea tables and the cardboard box that we work out of. And then that, that popped up again when you had clients come in, and you’re like: “Oh! Let’s make sure we look a certain way!” When I wanted to spend all my energy working on the internal, working on the mindset, the self-esteem, the self-confidence, so I could learn how to talk to people. ‘Cause in theory then, when all that stuff goes away, when it, when it gets torched or something happens, you still have the stuff inside, and that’s the important stuff. But, the last thing that you mentioned, which is (a thing that we referred to as “closing the gap”), a lot of creative people, they know their fullest potential and they keep saying to themselves: “If a client ever gave me the opportunity, I would do this amazing work!” What they’re doing is they’re putting the burden of work and the leap of faith and the risk in the client’s hands. You said to yourself, very wisely: “We want to do this kind of work. Realistically, looking at our own work, we’re not going to get this kind of work based on our portfolio. So we need to make the time and energy and, and put the resources together to, to put this kind of work out.” And it, and you for, for doing what you did, almost–it felt instant results. You put out the projects, it got talked about, it got shared on all these sites and these blogs, and then all this attention was now turned onto you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yup.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And it was wonderful, so you were rewarded for making your efforts about showing the people, the world, the potential that you believed in yourself, but hadn’t shown before. And that’s how you go about and get this work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@58:05\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So you guys out there that are scratching your head and thinking about this right now, how do I make that transition from being a “poor, broke person” (but not broken person, just a broke person), and, how do I make that transition? How do I get out of that? So close the gap. You have to do good work. All of the conversation we’re having right now, you guys, means that you have to know your craft. That’s the beginning part, but that’s not the end. That’s just the beginning. Okay. Any other questions? And I’mma show more of your work and we’re gonna kind of figure out like life lessons, things that you can peel away from this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Any other kind of questions, you guys? People are saying this is like the “best livestream ever,” it’s like, that’s a little hyperbolic, but I’ll take that. Okay. Somebody’s putting in quotes (air quotes). Gianfranco, uhh, he’s saying “Adult-design equals money?” I don’t know. Alright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: We got a couple of questions.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You do? Okay, fire away, man.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: Yeah, um, this one comes from Galley Taylor?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright, speak into the mic, dude.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: Oh.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: This one comes from Galley Taylor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Much better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[S]: And, she’s asking, uh, if: “When you look for a client–uh, when you look for clients, do you look for one with definite budgets for service, or do you look, do you work with clients to organically develop a budget for your service?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Do you understand the question?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yes, I do. You know I was, when you’re hungry, you’ll take any client. So when you’re developing and you’re trying to build that foundation, you’ll take pretty much any client, as long as they’re willing to pay you for your craft. So as you evolve and you become, um, more polished, uh, I think the rules change a little bit and, um, I think, fortunately for, uh, my business (Farm Design) that uh, we’ve evolved quite a bit in a really short period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@59:53\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And so the rules that I look for in a, in work, uh, I call it the sort of the “3 Ps.” It’s 3 rules I wanna try to hit and I, to determine if it’s the right project for us and, and the 3 Ps are: Portfolio, profit, and people. So portfolio is, I look at it when someone calls me, is it gonna be a project that I get really excited about? A juicy project? Something that I, I want to put into my portfolio? I want to take pride in? Um, the other one is: profit. Uh, I want to assess to see if the, the client is qualified, if they have a budget, and, uh, so I dig deeper, and I, you know, you ask those questions, sometimes it’s unveiled when you, when you do a proposal. And the third one is, um: people. Um, they say like 85% of your problems come from 15% of your clients, um…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s actually 80-20, it’s the Pareto Principle, but yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:00:50\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So I fudged it a little?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So I’ve worked with a lot of–what I consider–like, “bad” clients, and, and it just, it takes the soul out of you when you work with certain people that either they don’t respect you or they don’t respect your craft, or conversely so. So I think it’s really important when you’re in a business relationship that, um, it’s a healthy relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:01:11\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So my role is: I need to have at least 2 of those working for me. You can’t just have one and I think that the, the unicorn is if you can have all 3. So, when assessing like type of work that uh we want to work for, or the type of people, um, so I don’t necessarily have to have make money every single time I take a job if the people I respect and they’re fun to work with, and it’s a portfolio piece that’s really exciting. ‘Cause I know that’s an investment that’s gonna get the next job. Um, but you can do any, any combination, but for me it’s gotta be at least 2 out of those 3.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah. Okay. 2 out of the 3. Any other questions? Emmanuel? Sam?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Yeah, we have a question from…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Fire away.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Jaimie Montaño. Uhh, she’s asking: “How do you produce good work when you’re in a hurry because you’re super low on cash?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You got it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:01:59\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah. “How do you produce work?” I, I don’t believe in working fast. I, I think, um, as a, as a creative director guiding my design staff, I, I never say: “Work faster. Hurry up.” Because I, I think you’re just going to get inferior work. They’re just gonna like, “Uhhhhhhh.” There’s gonna–there’s that tension and they’re trying to craft something. I, I believe in being highly productive, and so, um, trying to do something in a short period of time, I think, part of it is you gotta be realistic with the project and the timelines that you take on. I, I think it would be a disservice to your client if you take on a project that you can’t meet the deadlines, and if you can’t do it at a certain uh standard and quality that, uh, that you believe in, then, you, you, you simply shouldn’t take it. You have to be able to walk away from a project because ultimately you’re going to tarnish that relationship and they’re not gonna come back. Um, I buh–I believe in building relationships so that client continues to come back. I, I’m personally not a salesperson, so I, I don’t do traditional-like sales, cold calls. I don’t do a lot of outbound sort of marketing ‘cause it’s just not my style, so, when I have an opportunity to work with a client, I wanna make sure I, I put my best foot forward because I want to be able to continue that working relationship.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:03:19\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Do you guys have a follow-up question for him? I’m trying to monitor Facebook and, and YouTube as well. Wel, why don’t we do this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: I…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, go ahead, Erica.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Um, so, do you have any projects that you regret doing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Any projects that…?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You regret doing? Any projects that you regret doing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:03:38\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Oh, wow. That’s a great question. Absolutely. I’m trying to–haha–I, I think, oftentimes, the projects that I regret are because I didn’t align or have the same values or principles as my client. Um, so I think it’s not necessarily uh if I made money or didn’t make money, if, or, um, if it’s uh, a portfolio piece or not, I think the projects that I regret most are aligning with someone that they didn’t respect our craft or I didn’t respect their vision, and so, I try to avoid those relationships. But! Sometimes you don’t know until you get into that relationship, so, it’s, it’s, it’s challenging and, and sometimes you have to be willing to accept the fact that it may not be a good relationship and like, and just, say, “You know, I just don’t think it’s a good fit. And I think, uh, I wish you the best of luck,” and you just part ways. But, um, “projects that you regret,” it’s…I think, I will continue to encounter those, and–but I’m always trying to like do my, uh, best due diligence to sort of curb the, that. But it’s, it’s challenging.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Uh, I have a follow-up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[E]: Um, so how do you deal with those projects where you realize that “Maybe we shouldn’t have taken this?” But you did and then you have to follow through with it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:05:08\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I seldom, I, I don’t like to leave people in a lurch. I think there’s something about my personality, so, I, I, I don’t typically will walk away from a challenging situation. Um, I, I think if it’s the, the client, and it’s a tumultuous relationship where there’s tension and we’re not seeing eye to eye, then I’m just gonna have that conversation with them that, you know, I think maybe there’s someone better for you. And then we sort of figure out some sort of exit strategy. I think otherwise if we continue down this uh, this tumultuous relationship then I don’t think we’re gonna be able to produce our best work, the experience is gonna be tarnished and at the end, ultimately, neither party is gonna be happy, so, why go through that, that long process? I think it’s best to just be open and transparent, and just say, “I, I think we’re not the best fit.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. I, I wrote down some things here. Let’s see here. There was a question from YouTube that asked: “Is that fake restaurant project still available on your site somewhere? And what’s it called?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It’s not on our website anymore, but it lives on the Internet because one of the great things is…the, there’s a, an influential blog called “The Dieline”…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, there’s a, other blogs out there, and when we put projects out there, and with technology and social media, um, people pick it up if it’s noteworthy and they share that information. So, the projects still live out there, I think the one I was referring to is called “Old Boy Blues?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm. I’m gonna find it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: “Old Boy Blues.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And, the designer that worked on that, she was actually an intern at my company. She is now my art director and she’s been with me for 5 years. So, this project was, you know, it was kind of a labor of love and we, we were like trying to feel it out. And it was all mock-ups. It was hypo–purely hypothetical, but that got us our first restaurant project and today, we, we do a ton of restaurant work and I think on any given day, we’re probably working on 2 or 3 restaurant projects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I am not finding your project here. But I will trying finding–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: “Old Boy…Blues?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Uhh, I’ll try, but let me do “Farm Design” and see what I come up with. You can keep talking to me while I find this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, I think, um, talking about how, um, technology can help drive marketing for yourself, is even the Mugo project that we were referring to earlier is, it got picked up by The Dieline. I didn’t expect this. Um, they picked it up because I had posted something on my website, uh, The Dieline picked it up and posted it, and then I started getting all these calls, and one of the calls I got was from Dreamworks. Uh, Dreamworks contacted me and they said they wanted to do uh, a licensing partnership deal with me on, on Mugo. And this is all because I put something out there. I tried to create an opportunity, I didn’t know where it was gonna take me, but I knew that I needed to put something out there and create my own opportunities, and then I was able to get Mugo into Walmarts and Urban Outfitters and, and retail, but I, I learned a lot from that. I’m no longer doing Mugo, but I think that opportunity taught me a lot of lessons about the business side of design and it took a lot, um, less off the creative side, so when I’m going into meetings with clients, I can talk about the business side, which I learned through Mugo. Like, what is your go-to market strategy? How, you know, what is your, um, what are your costs? Um, what is your distribution channels? You know, you ask these questions and I never would have been informed and knew how to ask, because I was a designer, I was more talking about the right font and the colors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:09:04\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: But I think if you talk uh business on a strategic level and you bring value to um, the relationship, then that’s when, uh, they’re more intrigued and uh, see you as a valued partner as opposed to just as a designer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And that’s when my business really started to grow, is when I changed the dialogue from “design” to “business strategy.” And I think that’s a big part of why my business sort of took another step.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, I’m gonna make a note to follow up on this, but I found “Ol’ Boy Blues.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s right here on the screen. It’s ‘cause I was typing “old,” I didn’t know it was “Ol’ Boy Blues.” So this is what it looks like. I remember you working on this. And this reminded me to kind of ask you this question about mock-ups and things like that, because some people in our pro-group, I, I told them you’re gonna be on the show and they said, “Ask him about how he does such a great job with his mock-ups and Behance.” Are there any tips that you can share with us? How much labor is put into these photographs that we are seeing here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:10:00\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Well, we’re not photographers so we just, we just do the best we can. We just try to figure it out, and I think that’s the, that’s the whole key to these things. It’s just, you figure it out. Just, just go into it, not necess–you don’t have to know the outcome. You just have to be willing to take that first step. Um, so this, we, we–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Now take for example this image here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Is this a stock photo that you comp’d the thing onto the brick wall?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No, we actually, there was, this is one of the alleyways behind, uh, one of our office, our office in Pasadena, and we, we shot this, with the, with the SLR camera and then we actually photoshopped uh the graphics onto the brick wall there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Who’s the guy wearing the vest carrying the crate and the bicycle?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: He was an employee at the time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh! Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And uh, so yeah. He modeled for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. And he had a vest and an old straw hat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That’s his style.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. What restaurant are we photographing this in?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, so we’re like: We need to get that contextual shot, and so we actually went into uh, uh, a burger place, and we said, uh, “We’re doing a student project. Would you mind if we shot some photos?” And they said, “No problem.” So we ordered some food and we took some snapshots.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, I remember at this time, you barely even knew how to use the camera, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I was terrible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I remember ‘cause you were asking me questions–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I still don’t know how to use the camera.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, well that’s fine. But you knew enough now on how to take a shot that’s kind of lit well and kind of understand lighting. And it’s a key part to you being able to do such great mock-ups.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, for us it’s a lot about storytelling, so it’s like we wanted to tell the story, the brand story, contextualize it and, and so that was, that was circa–there might be a date on there–circa 2012, maybe? 13?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Something like that. That’s okay. And then I want to look at your portfolio now on Farm, Farm Design on Behance. You get a lot of leads on, from Behance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: We get a lot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You get a lot. And so I want to talk about this for a brief moment ‘cause I’ve been harping on this to our audience. And they’re like: “Chris, I can’t get any work!” And I said, “Are you on Behance? What does it look like? And how much effort and energy did you put into those things?” So, I’m gonna step onto this one since it’s the newest one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: This “Ciderworks” thing here. Let’s take a look at it. Go ahead and talk us through this thing. What are you doing here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: This is a project that we just launched yesterday. It’s called “Bivouac.” It’s a cider company in San Diego, California, they came to us maybe a year and a half ago because they saw some logos that we put on Behance that also was just a hypothetical project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Which one was that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That was, um, uh “Rust Coffee.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Rust Coffee, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You guys look–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So we, we put…you know, so they found us on Behance, uh, they contacted us and we started–uh, they do cider. They wanted to do canned cider. They wanted to have a restaurant, um, sort of a, uh, uh, a watering hole for their clients or consumers, and, this is a year and a half process. And so when we put this together, it’s, it’s a combination of uh, telling a story, telling a brand story and hitting a lot of sort of the different facets of the brand, um, we try to look at sort of micro and macro sort of stories. A lot of what you see here are (those cans and boxes), those are mock-ups. So, whether we do a uh 3-D model, um or we use stock photography sites–uh, those I think we got from um, yellowimages.com, they do all these really great, sort of mock-ups with lighting, and so um we buy those off of there. And a lot of these other ones, like, when we look at stock photography, like you here, you have here with the guy holding the, the beer bottle, his…finding the right stock photography that doesn’t look like stock photography, that also aligns with the vision of the brand, so, it’s not just like pulling a photo and dropping it in there. It’s like you have to really curate and think about how that story works. Is it the right demographic? Does it have the right lighting and the tonality? Um, that one there, we loved to use stocksy.com is a really great sort of stock photo site. They don’t feel stock. We also use Shutterstock, um, dot com, but Shutterstock typically is, is good for, um, more sort of pedestrian-looking images. They do look kind of stock. But it’s a combination of mocking things up, shooting things, shooting them in-studio, um, shooting them out-of-studio…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well here’s what I wanna do: I want to break this thing down. And I’m gonna prep you for this in case you don’t want to do it. But, I’m gonna ask you a little bit about the business part of this thing, but not just yet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Let’s talk about these cans. Is this CG? Computer generated? Or is this photographed?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Can you tell me? What do you think?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I think it’s CG.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: How can you tell?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: ‘Cause I know you don’t know how to photograph cans.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay. You are correct. It is, it is a mock-up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Hold on! I’m sorry for that!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It is a mock-up. But, I think–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It’s beautiful!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think some of the best, um, interpretations of branding are mock-ups. I don’t think it has to be a photograph.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: No apologies. No apologies, dude. I don’t care. I think it looks great! I, I’m only guessing because I-you said, “I still don’t know how to take photos.” And to take a can sweating like this, it’s not that easy to do, and I look at the gradations a lot. You used that yellow? What, what?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yellow Images.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yellow Images for this. How much did it cost you to buy the model for this and put uh, put your label on it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: A dollar fifty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Two hundred and fifty dollars, okay. A dollar fifty, you guys!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: A dollar fifty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: A dollar fifty. So that’s like–thanks for sharing this. Now, I, I just want to take a moment and say this to you guys that are out there: Aaron could have hoarded these resources. He could have said, “You guys just figure it out.” Because if you guys go look for 3-D mock-ups, you might spend quite a bit of time, trial and error, in finding the right vendors. So I really appreciate you saying that, and I’ve not heard of “Stocksy” before, and we’ll talk a little bit more about that. So he’s sharing his resources–he’s basically saying: “You guys, go out there and make better comps.” And, and I’m not, I’m not gonna feel the competition from you right now.” Let’s keep going on here. Why did you put this kind of “mountain-scape” behind it? Tell me about the thinking behind that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:15:55\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Sure. Well, Farm Design is a branding agency, so, we are trying to attract clients and build brand systems for them. So it’s not just a logo, it’s not just a website. We like to build systems. In order to build a, uh, a brand system that is effective and can connect and communicate with their audience, you have to have many different facets to it. And so, there’s a lot of sort of tertiary, um, secondary and tertiary sort of, um, artifacts (is what we like to call them), so, a primary artifact can be a logo. And if you scroll down a little bit farther, you know, you also have secondary marks, colors, textures…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Hold on. Lemme, let me drive this a little bit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Tell me about the mountain though. So are you, where does this label go? Is this for an ad? Or you just added this for you, for the presentation of it? Did they actually use this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: They did. Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That one was actually born from one of the moodboards we created.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I see.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And we actually used that uh, “texture,” if you will–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, uh, sort of kind of a misty, uh, ethereal background, um, to capture the essence of this adventure and outdoor lifestyle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C] Yeah, it’s just a cold mountain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I want my beverages to be cold, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, this restaurant photo: Is this their actual place? Their business?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: This is their actual place. It just literally opened up 2 days ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I see. So this is fresh off the press.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Where is this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: San Diego.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: So you drove down to San Diego and you took this photo?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It was given to us and we’re actually going to go there and shoot it with, uh, consu–our, uh, consumers in the space, ‘cause I think it brings a different dynamic. So even though we posted it now, we’re going to constantly update this to sort of enhance and improve it so we want to reshoot these and, and bring a different energy to it with having people in it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:17:41\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Why is it important for you to constantly improve and revisit these presentations you have on Behance?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Because I know that there are clients out there that are constantly looking at us. Not only today, you know, next month, a year from now, so, why not? We have the opportunity. This is, this is dynamic information. It’s not static. It’s like, once you put it up there, it doesn’t have to–it’s not permanent. It’s not like we’re printing something, an you have to burn it and reprint it. It’s, it’s so easy just to repopulate it and, on this forum, and because clients down the road, they’re gonna see it, and they’re gonna want. And they’re gonna see those details and the nuances, so we’re always trying to improve our craft…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Constantly improving our craft.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:18:21\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright, I want to say this to you guys. There’s this concept from Jim Rohn’s book, “The 7 Strategies for Wealth and Happiness.” He talks about the minors and the majors, what you don’t want to do is mix up these 2 things. You don’t want to make a minor effort for a major result or a goal. And you also don’t want to make a major effort for a minor goal. When you’re talking about your lead-gen source, basically all your sales and marketing, in terms of inbound, is coming from Behance, so it behooves you to do the very best job, and I’ve seen him do this and assign teams to do this, they could spend days, if not weeks working on the layout, the typography, the color palette, the phrasing, the order, and revisit with photography, and that’s why your work stands out. There are a hundred thousand, maybe a couple million people on Behance. Well, why is it always that the best work rises to the top? It’s because they put the time and energy into it and you need to do the same. I, I want to go back and it’s getting close to us breaking for the show here, and I’m sure our livestream audience probably doesn’t want it to end, but it’s gonna end at some point, so I want to dissect this really quickly, just give me shorter answers as what slide you want to talk about. This is a deep-dive into his portfolio, his sales and marketing technique because of the work that we’re seeing here. “Embrace your adventure.” Did you guys write that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yes, we did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And so there’s a little typographic–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Brand voice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And they can use that. I saw it on the can. And again, there’s another photo here. I’m assuming that’s stock photo.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Correct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And then, this is another 3-D mock-up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693827b0dbce3f_AaronAtchison_work2.jpeg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yes, again, Yellow Images.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm. Really good. Look–look at that corrugated cardboard there! You guys, that’s lookin’ really slick.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, I say, ‘cause when I look at portfolios and I can tell that it’s a mock-up, that, I–I say it’s revealing the man behind the curtain. I want to try to craft something that you can’t quite tell, like, “Hmm, is that real or not?” That’s the level of detail that we’re trying to get, so like how the light hits it, how the shadows reflect, all those little nuances, if you can make it where you don’t reveal the man behind the curtain, then I think, then it’s okay. Then we’re gonna post it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Are they giving you the 3-D model? Or you give them the artwork and they render it for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It, it’s actually really great because if you subscribe to a premium version on YellowImages.com, you can actually have them do a 3-D render for you. You just give them the drawings, and I think in 2 to 4 weeks, then they’ll give you something. But then they’ll use that as, uh, they’ll sell that on–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: The stock model.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: As a stock model on there, ‘cause they’re just trying to build content as well, so for a small fee of 300 dollars a year…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: They’ll actually make custom renders for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: What’s the limitation and how many can you get done?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I believe it’s just one angle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Oh, I mean in a year. Uh, you pay 300 dollars in a year–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Unlimited.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Wow!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, guys.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: If you were to hire a CG guy to do it–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Of course.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: The’re gonna charge more than 300. This, I think–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: For sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think they’re in Russia.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well, whatever. Okay, so if you guys should be in a 3-D, mock-up rendering business, you are now just out of business. Okay, let’s keep going here. “Ride the winds of change.” Something you wrote…the feather…the same misty mountains…these coasters. Are these mock-ups?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It is a mock-up, and you can tell, like, we even put like a, like a, uh, water stain on the actual coaster, uh shadows and we, so we composited all that together with the background, um…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Photo-comping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah, the whole thing is, like, is a composite. And this entire project here, I would say we probably invested around 100 hours to sort of mock this up. ‘Cause this is maybe 2 people working on it for over a week?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That’s, that’s how important it is to us, because I know the investment of that time and effort–I have to pay these, my employees to do this!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, I understand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So it’s an investment, and we know that this is gonna beget the next project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right. And I’m gonna say something that is both a complement and an insult to you. You ready? I tell my team: “Guys, look at these mock-ups. This is the gold standard,” to my team. And, “We can do better than this because we’re better than them, aren’t we? Are you telling me we’re not as good as them?” So I, I kinda just throw it out there. So if you guys (my team) can’t make better mock-ups and layouts than this, you’re not worth that much to me. I don’t say it quite like that, but, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:22:22\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Where is the insult?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: The insult’s: We’re better than this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I think anyone can be better than this, and, and I know that–and, and with that–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:22:31\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: It’s like, we’re all, we also know that we can be–get better at this game as well, and so, a year from now, we expect our portfolio and our mock-ups to be better…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: …than it is today. So, you never just settle on your laurels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I, I do want to say this: Your mock-up game is tight. So, you’re, you’re already at that kind of upper echelon. Are these your shoes?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That is me, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I can recognize your foot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Wait, that was also a composite because the, the…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: …photo wasn’t great, and so we composited things together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: A lot of color-correction, shadows, reflections, uhhh beer stains. All that–err–water stains. So this is, so you guys know when, when they say that they’re a branding agency, they truly are ‘cause they’re writing copy, they, they’re working on a lot more touch points than just the mark itself or just one package. They’re trying to create the entire kind of visual reflection of what this brand is all about. Okay, so I think you did a great job there of explaining all that stuff, of course, this is the sort of stuff we see in a lot of sites, and you like to do these multiple logos (that you call them “brand artifacts”), I think that’s, that’s the thing that you like to, to do for your clients. This is a stock photo, I’m pretty sure of it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:23:32\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: This guy’s throwing hops, or whatever he’s doing right here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Correct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:23:34\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. Great. Good job, man! And I, I do want to say this to both designers and clients who are potentially watching this episode, is that: There are a lot of really great images out there. Maybe too many. And the problem is the ability to hone and find just the right image. So the image might not cost you very much in terms of payment, like, to buy an image off Shutterstock or Stocksy, it’s, it’s really pennies compared to what it would cost to commission somebody. What you are paying for is somebody with an eye who can curate this stuff and scan hundreds of–if not thousands–of images to find the one right fit for you. And that is a skill, and that is worth paying for. ‘Cause they’ve taken an asset that is a dollar and they’ve made it a hundred-thousand dollar image.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Because they’ve selected the right one, they might have gone and color-corrected it and adjusted some things so it becomes something that–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Absolutely. Those details, the curation is so important. And, it’s like, you can tell pretty quickly if that’s a stock photographer–photograph, or a mock-up. We try to, sort of, increase that perception of what that is and be able to tell a story. So your focusing on the story. And I think if you do it really well, I think that’s, that’s what we’re trying to accomplish.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:24:44\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. I want to talk a little bit about business now. Could we talk some business?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright. How much did you get paid for that project?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: The Bivouac?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: That was an interesting one because it was, uh, I actually got stock options in the business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Woohoo! Excuse me! It’s the dinger on that! There we go. Alright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Oh my God. Did you really…?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah, I did.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Nah, um. So I’m actually, uh, part owner, but very small.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Very, very small. But if this thing gets sold to Budweiser, you know.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You’ll, you’ll, you’ll combine that with–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Um, but in lieu of, uh, in terms of cash, it was, um, I think it was 45 thousand?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Whoof!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: 45 thousand?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Good for you!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So it was in 3 payments, uh, spread out over a year and a half but, um, yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Excellent. And when you told the client–we’ll talk about some of the mindset stuff here–here, let me put this down, uhh, 45 thousand dollars, we always have these kind of fears, like, “Uhh, is it too much? Is it too little?” Tell me about your mindset when you’re like working on the estimate for this thing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:25:49\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay, so, the, the individual who contacted us actually was already engaged with, with another agency down in San Diego, an agency that (when I was in school, over 20 years ago), I looked up to. I would buy books because their logos were in it, and–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I know who you’re talking about.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: They were, they were, they’re amazing. They’re still amazing. And when I heard that he’s working with them, I’m like: “Okay, we’re kind of not in your league, or the league that you’re looking for.” But he said, “I saw the ‘Rust’ project,” (and you can–) it’s on our Behance page it’s–and that was a hypothetical project. He said, “I just love what you guys do, there’s something about that.” And so, he wanted us to put a proposal together. I, I knew the agency that he was already engaged with, but that he was having, um, concerns with. And, so I, I took a risk, like, I’m gonna go bid higher out of my comfort zone because you’re always pushing us and, and on the ph–when we chat, we have our tea time and you’re always saying: “Ask for more! Why are you ask–you can, you can ask! Like okay, this is this one time\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay, okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: This is this one time I think I’m gonna listen to Chris again. I’m gonna try to go out of my comfort zone, because probably my comfort zone is…far less. And so I put that proposal together, and my number (I said it was 45) I found out that the other agency, I think, was 120 thousand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So I was woefu–I was like woefully less than them, but I was con–incredibly content with what I got.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:27:25\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: But could I, could I have asked for more? But, it’s like, you know, you’re always sort of trying to figure out what your comfort level is, and what your value you bring to the project, and you, you’re always assessing if the client can afford you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Right. I, I want to talk about this for a brief minute. ‘Cause there are not many people who are on this show, who know me as well as you do. We’ve had thousands of hours of talking–sometimes personal, sometimes business–uh, in the last 20 years that we’ve known each other. I just want to give you guys an opportunity here, for you to totally mock me right now. When I’m talking to you and I’m like, “Aaron, blah blah blah.” You can par–you can, you can do your parody of what you think you hear when I say these things. I would love to hear you say that, for our audience, for our fans, I think they’re gonna like it. What do you hear? Like when I’m barking these things at you, what do you hear? How does this sound like in your brain?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e@1:28:16\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I mean…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You ready?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Oh my gosh…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You–do your close-up! Right there!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Oh my gosh!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Tell the people how it sounds in your brain. I’ll get out of your shot, go ahead.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:28:23\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Well, I mean, when we first started, we were kind of like enemies because we were like–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: We’re not enemies!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No, we were! We started out as enemies! Like, I just wanted to crush you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I never saw it like that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: And then\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It was easy to crush you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: You know, I always admired what you’ve been able to accomplish and build before even before you started The Futur, and it, it was really impressive, but I think a lot of my pride and stubbornness is like, I, I don’t want to listen to someone who is “up here.” I, I probably would listen to my parents, but I didn’t want to listen to you. And so it, for you it was just like, I, I can figure it out. I’m gonna do it my own way. And, I had to sort of realize that you’re giving me like really sound advice. So, it’s hard for me to, to parody you, but I just…I had to break down walls and sort of let you (like I, I, you’re younger than me, but I consider you like my “wise uncle”). I don’t know if that’s an insult, but no! You, you provide so much knowledge, whether it’s right or not, it’s like I, I, I start to filter it, and I start to slowly let it creep in. So it’s a–it’s been a slow burn, but I, I think I’m, I’m more open to, uh, listening to you because I think you provide, like, great content for your, your audience and I think, I think they see incredible value. So I, as, as much as you want me to mock you, I’m gonna thank you. Can I, can I just pivot? Can I just–can we do that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You can do whatever you want, man. I was trying to give you your opportunity to blast it out of the universe!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: No, I, I’m–that’s not, that’s not my personality.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: How are you not gonna mock me because other people have and they’ve done a fantastic job, so here’s what I heard (uhh, Aaron used these words): “Enemy, creep, and burn.” So, you can put those things together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Yeah. It’s all good. It’s all good. We have a great relationship, you guys. Okay, umm, Erica, Emmanuel, and Sam: Do you guys have any last thoughts before I close out on the deck, you guys?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[Emmanuel]: Umm, I have a question from Aina San: “Umm, what do you do when you’re professional opinion or own project differs from what client wants? And he can’t be convinced?”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Did you hear what he said?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Nah, I didn’t hear…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Basically, what do you do when your clients start to take aw–the project away from what it’s supposed to be? How do you respond to that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:30:37\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: God, that’s a great question. We’re, we’re challenged with this all the time. All the time. Uh, I think at the end of the day, ultimately they are the client, and they hired you to provide them a service. The best that we can do is we can, we can shepherd the process the best we can. We also know that we probably know more than them on a branding standpoint. So the best we can do is we can say, “Our professional advice is that, we would urge you to do this.” Ulti–ultimately at the end of the day, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do. And that’s the way it, it’s gonna be. Um, so you’ve got to pick your battles, um, but you try to do what is best for the client, and, but at some point you gotta, you gotta just let them do what they’re gonna do.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: I, I hope that answered the question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: It, it’s your answer. That’s good enough for me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Yeah.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Alright, guys. I want to thank you for coming on the show. Aaron, before we say goodbye, I want to look at some of your work and talk a little bit about your journey, and I’m gonna send this out. Alright? With some music, I think.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Can, can I say–\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: You can say whatever.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A] That when we talk about my journey, it’s like I, I wanna give a shout out to the people that aren’t here in the studio, and that’s all my employees.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Past and present.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: ‘Cause yeah. Because they help shape who I am and they help shape the business, and so this output is a collective, uh, a collective group of really talented and young individuals. Um, so I just don’t, I want to make sure everyone knows that this is not me, this is a collection of like I think really like-minded, um, individuals.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Well, I can’t leave you there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Okay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: I, I can’t. When you say, “This is not me,” I, I see a man transformed from the guy who’s like, “I, I can’t even hire an intern to cut things for me.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Right.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: From 10 years ago whenever that was in 2000-ish. Somewhere in 2005, to now, 13 years later. What has happened to that man? What happened to Peter Pan?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:32:37\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: You know, I realized that in order to grow, that you have to accept that you don’t know everything. And so, I, I, I think I was very humbled when I sort of hit rock bottom, um, and I sort of reassessed who I am and who I wanted to be, so for me, I want to do things that are greater than myself, and do things that are fulfilling, and I think one of the greatest things that, um, I’ve learned and that is fulfilling to me, is helping others become better people as well, so, I–for me, it’s no longer working. The work doesn’t–it’s not, I’m not doing it for myself, I’m doing it to support and nurture my staff, and my clients, and I think that is the biggest reward. It’s not a monetary thing, um, it’s not re–awards on the wall, it’s really like, seeing individuals that I work with, and clients that I work with, succeeding in life, and, there’s a couple of designers and my, my staff, they actually are taking things that they learn from me, and then they are mentoring students now, so they are volunteering their time on weekends, and they created their own program, and they’re sharing information that they learned from me, so there’s–that is, that is pretty powerful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e@1:33:51\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: So I just wanna like keep empowering people to empower people and, and to be in that situation–I wasn’t in that situation when I was a solopreneur. I was just focusing on me. Now I’m focusing on something beyond me, so when I say this isn’t just me, I, I’m trying to lead a team, and I just, you know, they’re the ones that are sort of helping with the vision, and sort of guiding this path that we’re all going down. It’s not–I’m, I’m just trying to like, pave the way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Mm, mm. Okay, so here’s what I’m hearing from you. Is that when you’re working by yourself as a solopreneur, it becomes, kind of like this echo-chamber and (I hate to say it like this, but) it was very ego-centric\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Very much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: And it was about all “me, me, me, me.” It’s like, “Marsha, Marsha, Marsha,” and that’s what it became. And what I’m hearing from you now is that (if, if I read this correctly), it’s that now you take great pride, not in the work that you do, but in terms of how you’re transforming other people’s lives, so when your team grows, and they do great work, you can take pride in that that you were able to create space or guidance or mentorship, or just helping them define the right clients, to get to that place. And then you also couple it off with, “It wasn’t about I wanted to do from a design point of view (which is self-centered and selfish), it was about trying to help your clients also have that same kind of success. So you can’t have a successful business without being a different kind of person.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Mm-hmm.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Everybody wants to be successful, so few people are willing to do the work that’s needed to change, and, and to me, that’s what you’ve been able to do. You’ve taken everything that I think is uh, an accumulation of your experiences and biases, and you’ve gone against that. You’ve let go of so many things. And that’s what has been, I think, the key to your transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[A]: Uh, uh, I think that’s pretty accurate. I think it’s, it’s getting out of your comfort zone and challenging yourself, and I think that’s when you grow as an individual. And then, learning from that and you challenge people around you to help them grow, so, getting out of that comfort zone, I think is a big part of growth. In order to get out of your comfort zone, you have to be able to accept the fact that you don’t know everything.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e[C]: Okay. So let’s look at a couple, few, last slides and we’re gonna close up the show, or close out the show. Here’s some more things. Of course, you guys can go to Behance and look up Farm Design.

And this is really wonderful, beautiful work. It’s got really great attention to detail, patterns and textures and color palettes, and I, I truly appreciate and love all the contextual applications that you provide.

This includes: Cinemagraphs, parallax effects, tricky animation or unconventional interfaces. A simple hamburger menu with the following will work: work, about, contact. Use a legible and neutral typeface. Limit the number of colors you use. Have a simple logo. If you don’t have one, just typeset your name in Helvetica Bold using upper/lower case. Make your site SEO friendly. Name the images on your site with descriptive names. “Untitled” or “Final_final_03” doesn’t count as being descriptive.

Keep the photography or mock-ups simple to make your work shine. Where appropriate, document the creative process. Put the time and energy into designing every component so that it looks as attractive (and expensive) as possible. Look at your work through the lens of a prospective client. Would this excite them?

Two, they won’t worry about sharing you since you are growing your team. Some clients actually do worry that you won’t be available any more, or that you’ll become more expensive as a result. You can address by saying that, “Yes, our rates are going up, but I appreciate your business and loyalty. I will do my best to work within your budget moving forward and will give you preferential pricing.” Lastly, people don’t always think to refer you. It’s just not top of mind.

Make sure you say what you do and that your contact info is legible. Other than that, avoid using additional photography, illustration of artwork on your card. It’s a name card and not a billboard. Use 1-2 typefaces (max). One or two colors on a sturdy card stock is sufficient. Don’t spend more than a dollar per card. You’re better off stamping your name and contact info on a dollar bill and hand those out instead. When you are at social functions and have an opportunity to meet a prospective client, don’t give them your card. Instead, ask for theirs. Say, “I’d love to follow up with you after this event. Do you have a card?” When they give your their card, hand them yours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s more important to get their contact info than to give them yours. This way, you can follow up vs. waiting by the phone or inbox for them to reach out. The next business day, follow up by connecting with them on LinkedIn. Add a short note reminding them of who you are. Keep it short and simple. Close the note by inviting further dialogue if there’s interest.

Make sure the site is responsive, avoid anything that will slow down or impair the ability for someone to navigate your site. This includes: Cinemagraphs, parallax effects, tricky animation or unconventional interfaces. A simple hamburger menu with the following will work: work, about, contact. Use a legible and neutral typeface. Limit the number of colors you use. Have a simple logo. If you don’t have one, just typeset your name in Helvetica Bold using upper/lower case. Make your site SEO friendly. Name the images on your site with descriptive names. “Untitled” or “Final_final_03” doesn’t count as being descriptive. Instead, try “Los-Angles-Design-Branding-Anime-Expo”.

Two, they won’t worry about sharing you since you are growing your team. Some clients actually do worry that you won’t be available any more, or that you’ll become more expensive as a result. You can address by saying that, “Yes, our rates are going up, but I appreciate your business and loyalty. I will do my best to work within your budget moving forward and will give you preferential pricing.” Lastly, people don’t always think to refer you. It’s just not top of mind.

Make sure you say what you do and that your contact info is legible. Other than that, avoid using additional photography, illustration of artwork on your card. It’s a name card and not a billboard. Use 1-2 typefaces (max). One or two colors on a sturdy card stock is sufficient. Don’t spend more than a dollar per card. You’re better off stamping your name and contact info on a dollar bill and hand those out instead. When you are at social functions and have an opportunity to meet a prospective client, don’t give them your card. Instead, ask for theirs. Say, “I’d love to follow up with you after this event. Do you have a card?” When they give your their card, hand them yours.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s more important to get their contact info than to give them yours. This way, you can follow up vs. waiting by the phone or inbox for them to reach out. The next business day, follow up by connecting with them on LinkedIn. Add a short note reminding them of who you are. Keep it short and simple. Close the note by inviting further dialogue if there’s interest.

It’s one that I’ve gone through personally. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a young student studying graphic design at \u003ca href=\"http://www.artcenter.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArtCenter College of Design\u003c/a\u003e, I felt intimidated by the work that I saw in the student gallery.

I remember walking by the gallery and thinking to myself, one day, I hope my work will be as good as the work that I saw.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps you can relate. Maybe you’ve seen a few portfolios on Behance or Pinterest and thought the same thing. How is it that someone, who has access to the same tools, fonts and images as me, can do such incredible work? What’s the difference? How did they learn typography? What makes them so special and me less so? The answer came to me in the form of a petite, well dressed man with a British accent. His name was \u003ca href=\"http://www.simonjohnstondesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSimon Johnston\u003c/a\u003e and I was fortunate enough to have him as my Type I instructor. I didn’t know it then, but that class was about to fundamentally unlock the mysteries of design to me and my fellow classmates. I would actually learn how type works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first assignment he gave was perfectly designed. It taught us the principles of typography: legibility, alignment, contrast, spacing, scale, proportion and balance. I would later learn that the assignment that he gave us was the same one given at the \u003ca href=\"http://www.thebaselschoolofdesign.ch/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBasel School of Design \u003c/a\u003e— founded by legendary designers Armin Hoffman and Emil Ruder. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I completed each week’s assignment, I felt my skill and confidence with type grow. It was an amazing feeling. I could now look at books that featured amazing designers, and feel that I knew the invisible principles at work. I could see the grid structure. I felt like Neo in the Matrix when he was first able to see the code that made up the virtual world. It was truly exhilarating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269386fc5dbce5f_17-DF-Typography-03.008.png\" alt=\"Learn Typography - Slide Preview\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter that semester, I remembered returning to the student gallery and looked at the work again. My feeling had changed. Don’t get me wrong, the work was still amazing, but now, instead of wishing to do work as good as what I saw, \u003cstrong\u003eI realized that great work was achievable\u003c/strong\u003e. In that moment, a quiet, introverted student, became a confident designer, eager to apply his knowledge to all kinds of design problems. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLearning about type and typography taught me about space and proportion, something that could be applied to virtually anything. I’ve used what I learned to design furniture (book shelves, desks, etc…), building facades, interior spaces and everything else that has a visual form.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, years have passed, and I’m running a motion design studio. But the one thing that keeps coming up, with the influx of new designers to our shop, is that they lack some of the fundamentals of typography—they lacked the same knowledge that I got so many years ago. I would sit down with my designers, help them learn typography, and go over basic principles with them. At one point, I even conducted classes at our office to train our staff in typography. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter doing this for a few years, I got tired of saying the same thing over and over again as each new wave of designers came into our office. One night, I sat down and wrote a few key tips on typography. This document turned into the “Typography Manual,” which then turned into an animated video.

It’s one that I’ve gone through personally. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a young student studying graphic design at \u003ca href=\"http://www.artcenter.edu/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArtCenter College of Design\u003c/a\u003e, I felt intimidated by the work that I saw in the student gallery. After all, this was some of the best, most progressive work that was on display. I remember walking by the gallery and thinking to myself, one day, I hope my work will be as good as the work that I saw.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePerhaps you can relate. Maybe you’ve seen a few portfolios on Behance or Pinterest and thought the same thing. How is it that someone, who has access to the same tools, fonts and images as me, can do such incredible work? What’s the difference? How did they learn typography? What makes them so special and me less so? The answer came to me in the form of a petite, well dressed man with a British accent. His name was \u003ca href=\"http://www.simonjohnstondesign.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSimon Johnston\u003c/a\u003e and I was fortunate enough to have him as my Type I instructor. I didn’t know it then, but that class was about to fundamentally unlock the mysteries of design to me and my fellow classmates. I would actually learn how type works.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe first assignment he gave was perfectly designed. It taught us the principles of typography: legibility, alignment, contrast, spacing, scale, proportion and balance. I would later learn that the assignment that he gave us was the same one given at the \u003ca href=\"http://www.thebaselschoolofdesign.ch/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBasel School of Design \u003c/a\u003e— founded by legendary designers Armin Hoffman and Emil Ruder. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs I completed each week’s assignment, I felt my skill and confidence with type grow. It was an amazing feeling. I could now look at books that featured amazing designers, and feel that I knew the invisible principles at work. I could see the grid structure. I felt like Neo in the Matrix when he was first able to see the code that made up the virtual world. It was truly exhilarating.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269386fc5dbce5f_17-DF-Typography-03.008.png\" alt=\"Learn Typography - Slide Preview\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter that semester, I remembered returning to the student gallery and looked at the work again. My feeling had changed. Don’t get me wrong, the work was still amazing, but now, instead of wishing to do work as good as what I saw, \u003cstrong\u003eI realized that great work was achievable\u003c/strong\u003e. In that moment, a quiet, introverted student, became a confident designer, eager to apply his knowledge to all kinds of design problems. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLearning about type and typography taught me about space and proportion, something that could be applied to virtually anything. I’ve used what I learned to design furniture (book shelves, desks, etc…), building facades, interior spaces and everything else that has a visual form.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, years have passed, and I’m running a motion design studio. But the one thing that keeps coming up, with the influx of new designers to our shop, is that they lack some of the fundamentals of typography—they lacked the same knowledge that I got so many years ago. I would sit down with my designers, help them learn typography, and go over basic principles with them. At one point, I even conducted classes at our office to train our staff in typography. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter doing this for a few years, I got tired of saying the same thing over and over again as each new wave of designers came into our office. One night, I sat down and wrote a few key tips on typography. This document turned into the “Typography Manual,” which then turned into an animated video.

      "content_html": "\u003cdiv id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany people go into it thinking that they get to spend all of their time creating projects that they love, only to quickly realize that this is not the case. Not only do you have to be responsible for the quality of work that you produce, but you also have to now handle all of the not-so-fun nuances that keep a business running, such as accounting, sales, business development etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI still am learning a lot every day and still have a lot to learn. While freelancing for these past 6 months, I wanted to share some insight on 9 lessons that every freelancer should know—in no particular order.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 1: Be Yourself\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important lessons is to be confident in who you are as a freelancer. Start developing a personal approach to your creative work, but make sure you stay clear of making the work be about you when you are hired. You should always add your personal touch to your work, and over time, when your work gets more notice, this will be the main reason clients want to hire you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to your personal work, you have to be open to telling your story because you are the only one who is able to do that. For example, I am a freelance web developer and digital marketer, but I was born with one hand and coined my nickname The One Hand Wonder Man. I tell my story in my blog posts which help me relate and connect with potential clients on a deeper level. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t be afraid to tell your story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 2: Learn to Say No\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore I dive into this lesson, just know that it is a lot easier said than done. Especially when bills need to get paid and your workload is looking extra light, it is very tempting to say yes to any project that comes your way—but don’t. Look out for the warning signs when speaking to a potential client. Are they punctual? Do they respect your time and not argue about your rates? Do they have a vision of what type of work that they want to be done, or are they all over the place?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeeping these questions in mind will help you determine if this potential client is a good fit. Remember, when you accept a project you are potentially turning down a bigger one down the line, so you have to make sure that each project you take on is worth your time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 3: Define Your Key Audience\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing able to target your audience is going to be really effective when pitching to get new work. If you are a designer who has a portfolio with a lot of work done around software companies, then it doesn’t make sense to spend your time pitching restaurants and coffee shops. Once you have a clear audience in mind, you’ll be able to more effectively lock down clients in your niche. I’m not saying you have to stay in this area forever, but you’ll notice more times than not when pitching potential clients, they want to see the work that you have done that can be beneficial for them and the experience that you have in their field.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 4: Content is Always King \u0026amp; Queen\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eI cannot stress this enough. Especially being a web designer, you can create a beautiful website with nice elements and colors, but if there is no content or the content is lacking, then it defeats the purpose. Most of the time as a freelancer you have no control over the content that your client has, but this is where sometimes turning down work because you don’t want it to reflect poorly on your style comes in handy (see lesson 2).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen creating content for your own brand, of course, you should put emphasis on how it is presented to entice the reader, but the message of the piece is what is going to keep them hooked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 5: Add Value\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important lessons to learn is to always remember to add value to your clients. You aren’t selling your services. You are selling your value that you can bring to your client. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of people and companies that do what I do, but why do clients hire me? Because they can’t get the Max Pete experience from anywhere else in terms of efficiency, work ethic, and value that I bring to each client.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis will not only help attract and retain clients, but it will also make sure that you aren’t undervaluing yourself in terms of how much you’ll be making per project. Once you can effectively prove your value to a client, it is easier to stand firm on your pricing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to learn more about adding value, I strongly recommend watching this \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/RKXZ7t_RiOE\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e“How To Price Design Services”\u003c/a\u003e video by Chris Do and The Futur team.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLESSON 6: Building Relationships\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuilding relationships beyond just your clients is key to keep growing and expanding your brand. I am not too skilled when it comes to graphic design or photography, but I have people in my network that are who I refer to on an ongoing basis. I often get requests from clients that I can’t handle, but because I was able to build relationships with other creatives, I am able to send them work and vice versa.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe quote “Your Net Worth Is Your Network” is the truth. In order to be a successful freelancer, you have to get out and network with your fellow peers, even just reaching out to say you like a piece of work they did can lead to a long-lasting relationship. Also if you haven’t figured this out by now, the freelance life is pretty lonely. It is a lot better when you have an established network of peers that you can call on to get work done together and bounce ideas of each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 7: Never Stop Learning\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s very easy to keep your head down and to just focus on work, but don’t forget to keep learning. We live in a great time period where all we have to do is Google something to find the answer. Take full advantage of that. Want to get better at Photoshop? Start learning now. Want to learn more CSS for website development? Start learning now. Keep expanding your knowledge base and you’ll notice the positive effects that it has on you and your brand.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 8: Step Outside of Your Comfort Zone\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eGrowth does not happen inside your comfort zone. Yes, everything might seem fine and stable, but there is no growing and learning. You have to be okay with making mistakes and failing. It is all apart of the process and you’ll never know about it unless you step outside your own comfort zone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the points of being a freelancer is to not live the mundane 9-5 office life. You have to learn to get out of a comfortable mindset and take risks. You never know what opportunity is waiting for you outside your own comfort zone until you start exploring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 9: You\u0026#39;re Your Most Important Client\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis might be the most important lesson of them all. One of my favorite pieces of advice I have received this year was “Spend an hour a day working on your own brand before working on any client work.” This really made me change how I start my days because I often used to find myself scrambling to get client work done before I took the time to work on my own brand which led me to put off certain tasks to help me grow and get my name out there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI strongly recommend spending one hour in the morning tackling the things that you need to get done in order to grow your brand. It can be as simple as answering emails that you have been putting off, researching topics for new blogs posts, or starting to develop your own content marketing strategy. Don’t feel bad for putting yourself first.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLessons Learned\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eI hope all or at least some of these lessons help make you a better freelancer before you read them. Being a freelancer isn’t easy, and is always a work in progress. Don’t get too caught up if you aren’t where you want to be exactly in life today.

      "content_html": "\u003cdiv id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany people go into it thinking that they get to spend all of their time creating projects that they love, only to quickly realize that this is not the case. Not only do you have to be responsible for the quality of work that you produce, but you also have to now handle all of the not-so-fun nuances that keep a business running, such as accounting, sales, business development etc.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI still am learning a lot every day and still have a lot to learn. While freelancing for these past 6 months, I wanted to share some insight on 9 lessons that every freelancer should know—in no particular order.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 1: Be Yourself\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important lessons is to be confident in who you are as a freelancer. Start developing a personal approach to your creative work, but make sure you stay clear of making the work be about you when you are hired. You should always add your personal touch to your work, and over time, when your work gets more notice, this will be the main reason clients want to hire you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to your personal work, you have to be open to telling your story because you are the only one who is able to do that. For example, I am a freelance web developer and digital marketer, but I was born with one hand and coined my nickname The One Hand Wonder Man. I tell my story in my blog posts which help me relate and connect with potential clients on a deeper level. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon’t be afraid to tell your story.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 2: Learn to Say No\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore I dive into this lesson, just know that it is a lot easier said than done. Especially when bills need to get paid and your workload is looking extra light, it is very tempting to say yes to any project that comes your way—but don’t. Look out for the warning signs when speaking to a potential client. Are they punctual? Do they respect your time and not argue about your rates? Do they have a vision of what type of work that they want to be done, or are they all over the place?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeeping these questions in mind will help you determine if this potential client is a good fit. Remember, when you accept a project you are potentially turning down a bigger one down the line, so you have to make sure that each project you take on is worth your time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 3: Define Your Key Audience\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing able to target your audience is going to be really effective when pitching to get new work. If you are a designer who has a portfolio with a lot of work done around software companies, then it doesn’t make sense to spend your time pitching restaurants and coffee shops. Once you have a clear audience in mind, you’ll be able to more effectively lock down clients in your niche. I’m not saying you have to stay in this area forever, but you’ll notice more times than not when pitching potential clients, they want to see the work that you have done that can be beneficial for them and the experience that you have in their field.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 4: Content is Always King \u0026amp; Queen\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eI cannot stress this enough. Especially being a web designer, you can create a beautiful website with nice elements and colors, but if there is no content or the content is lacking, then it defeats the purpose. Most of the time as a freelancer you have no control over the content that your client has, but this is where sometimes turning down work because you don’t want it to reflect poorly on your style comes in handy (see lesson 2).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen creating content for your own brand, of course, you should put emphasis on how it is presented to entice the reader, but the message of the piece is what is going to keep them hooked.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eLesson 5: Add Value\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the most important lessons to learn is to always remember to add value to your clients. You aren’t selling your services. You are selling your value that you can bring to your client. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of people and companies that do what I do, but why do clients hire me? Because they can’t get the Max Pete experience from anywhere else in terms of efficiency, work ethic, and value that I bring to each client.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis will not only help attract and retain clients, but it will also make sure that you aren’t undervaluing yourself in terms of how much you’ll be making per project.

      "content_html": "\u003cdiv id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eEvery client is different, but most of them fall into one of four categories: Fishers, Square Peggers, Cost Conscious Clients, or Perfect Clients. Here are tips to help you identify the type of person you are dealing with in your client meetings, and hopefully, save you time and money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938a4dcdbce6b_Blog-the-fisher-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Fisher\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo you scored a meeting with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.thefutur.com/anatomy-first-meeting-part-one/\"\u003epotential new client\u003c/a\u003e. Great! They must be in the market for exactly what you do, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot necessarily. If you’re dealing with a Fisher, there may or may not be a legitimate job available. Instead, you’re dealing with someone who is fishing for information. That’s not an inherently good or bad thing, and it usually doesn’t mean ill intent. What it does mean is that you’re in danger of wasting a lot of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Fisher is often trying to figure out what they need to put a request for proposal(RFP) together for a project. It might just be that they’ve never done a digital project before. It could also be that they’re maliciously trying to figure out a baseline for your agency. Either way, it comes down to the same issue: they’re wasting your time without any real work available.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eManaging a Fisher\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe calling card of a Fisher is that they don’t have any intent to buy. Ask questions about why they asked for a meeting – if you’re listening for it, you should be able to pick them out pretty quickly. Sometimes I’ll be very straight about it and ask “would you like me to send you an RFP template?” If they’re upfront in their answer, then I’ve just saved us both a lot of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd time is really what it comes down to with a Fisher, and it’s why they’re such an important client type to recognize and understand. When meeting a client for the first time, you go in with the assumption that there’s work available. If you leave the meeting with the wrong first impression, you can pour hours into creating a proposal that just isn’t going to go anywhere. Creating a proposal and estimate takes time: it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI see many young agencies wasting a lot of effort on “fishing expeditions.” Qualifying your clients is key to avoiding this. Like I said before, don’t be afraid to ask upfront questions about what the potential client needs. Offer to send them an RFP template or educate them in other ways that aren’t going to drain your time and energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecognizing, understanding, and managing Fishers will save you time and effort in the long run. Though these clients generally aren’t malicious, they can be a major drain on your resources. Tread carefully when you meet a Fisher to make sure you have someone with actual work on your line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384664dbce6c_Blog-the-square-pegger-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Square Pegger\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike the Fisher, the Square Pegger does have a legitimate job for you to do. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s going to be easier to deal with. Here’s what you need to know to identify and manage this type of client.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Square Pegger is a client who isn’t the final decision maker, but they are responsible for getting something done. Due to this, they feel their job is on the line. They’re doing their due diligence, so they’re going to ask a lot of unusual questions that you might not normally run into in an initial client meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other clear sign of a Square Pegger is that they need specific examples of what they’re looking for. So, let’s say you have a Square Pegger who needs a mobile app developed. If you’ve never designed a mobile app, they’re not going to work with you. They want to see exactly what they’re buying at the outset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eManaging The Square Pegger\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the least effective things you can do with a Square Pegger is send them a huge proposal right up front. Any time you put in here that isn’t directly related to what they want will be wasted. Make sure you edit your proposal so it is succinct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother thing to keep in mind with this type of client is that they’re not the final decision maker. Something I like to do early on with any client is to determine what kind of partner they’re looking for. That way, if there are any issues we can’t overcome, I don’t end up wasting either of our time. But with a Square Pegger, you have to be aware of everyone else that’s going to be looking at the proposal too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore a Square Pegger gives you the sale, they’re going to have to share your proposal with their peers. So not only do you have to understand what the person you’re talking to wants in a partner, you’re also going to have to understand the people around them, AKA, “stakeholders.” What are the trigger points that would lead each person to purchase? What might their objections be? Understanding the organization as a whole will increase your chance of a sale with this type of client, or help you decide quickly that they’re not someone likely to buy from you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you meet with a Square Pegger, understand that they’re looking for something specific that you may or may not be able to provide. I know I tend to bump into this client type quite a bit, so be on the lookout.  The sooner that you can show them precisely what they’re looking for, or the sooner you realize that the two of you aren’t a good match, the better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Cost Conscious Client\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Cost Conscious Client is someone who sees what you provide as a commodity. They feel the same way about what you do as they would about buying a chair or a loaf of bread. If someone else is charging a certain price for what you do, the Cost Conscious Client is going to expect the same from you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the driving forces behind how this client makes decisions is past experience. Often, these clients have overpaid for something previously.

Here are tips to help you identify the type of person you are dealing with in your client meetings, and hopefully, save you time and money.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938a4dcdbce6b_Blog-the-fisher-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Fisher\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo you scored a meeting with a \u003ca href=\"https://www.thefutur.com/anatomy-first-meeting-part-one/\"\u003epotential new client\u003c/a\u003e. Great! They must be in the market for exactly what you do, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot necessarily. If you’re dealing with a Fisher, there may or may not be a legitimate job available. Instead, you’re dealing with someone who is fishing for information. That’s not an inherently good or bad thing, and it usually doesn’t mean ill intent. What it does mean is that you’re in danger of wasting a lot of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Fisher is often trying to figure out what they need to put a request for proposal(RFP) together for a project. It might just be that they’ve never done a digital project before. It could also be that they’re maliciously trying to figure out a baseline for your agency. Either way, it comes down to the same issue: they’re wasting your time without any real work available.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eManaging a Fisher\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe calling card of a Fisher is that they don’t have any intent to buy. Ask questions about why they asked for a meeting – if you’re listening for it, you should be able to pick them out pretty quickly. Sometimes I’ll be very straight about it and ask “would you like me to send you an RFP template?” If they’re upfront in their answer, then I’ve just saved us both a lot of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd time is really what it comes down to with a Fisher, and it’s why they’re such an important client type to recognize and understand. When meeting a client for the first time, you go in with the assumption that there’s work available. If you leave the meeting with the wrong first impression, you can pour hours into creating a proposal that just isn’t going to go anywhere. Creating a proposal and estimate takes time: it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI see many young agencies wasting a lot of effort on “fishing expeditions.” Qualifying your clients is key to avoiding this. Like I said before, don’t be afraid to ask upfront questions about what the potential client needs. Offer to send them an RFP template or educate them in other ways that aren’t going to drain your time and energy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eRecognizing, understanding, and managing Fishers will save you time and effort in the long run. Though these clients generally aren’t malicious, they can be a major drain on your resources. Tread carefully when you meet a Fisher to make sure you have someone with actual work on your line.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384664dbce6c_Blog-the-square-pegger-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Square Pegger\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eUnlike the Fisher, the Square Pegger does have a legitimate job for you to do. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s going to be easier to deal with. Here’s what you need to know to identify and manage this type of client.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Square Pegger is a client who isn’t the final decision maker, but they are responsible for getting something done. Due to this, they feel their job is on the line. They’re doing their due diligence, so they’re going to ask a lot of unusual questions that you might not normally run into in an initial client meeting.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other clear sign of a Square Pegger is that they need specific examples of what they’re looking for. So, let’s say you have a Square Pegger who needs a mobile app developed. If you’ve never designed a mobile app, they’re not going to work with you. They want to see exactly what they’re buying at the outset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eManaging The Square Pegger\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the least effective things you can do with a Square Pegger is send them a huge proposal right up front. Any time you put in here that isn’t directly related to what they want will be wasted. Make sure you edit your proposal so it is succinct.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnother thing to keep in mind with this type of client is that they’re not the final decision maker. Something I like to do early on with any client is to determine what kind of partner they’re looking for. That way, if there are any issues we can’t overcome, I don’t end up wasting either of our time. But with a Square Pegger, you have to be aware of everyone else that’s going to be looking at the proposal too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBefore a Square Pegger gives you the sale, they’re going to have to share your proposal with their peers. So not only do you have to understand what the person you’re talking to wants in a partner, you’re also going to have to understand the people around them, AKA, “stakeholders.” What are the trigger points that would lead each person to purchase? What might their objections be? Understanding the organization as a whole will increase your chance of a sale with this type of client, or help you decide quickly that they’re not someone likely to buy from you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you meet with a Square Pegger, understand that they’re looking for something specific that you may or may not be able to provide. I know I tend to bump into this client type quite a bit, so be on the lookout.  The sooner that you can show them precisely what they’re looking for, or the sooner you realize that the two of you aren’t a good match, the better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Cost Conscious Client\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eA Cost Conscious Client is someone who sees what you provide as a commodity. They feel the same way about what you do as they would about buying a chair or a loaf of bread. If someone else is charging a certain price for what you do, the Cost Conscious Client is going to expect the same from you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the driving forces behind how this client makes decisions is past experience. Often, these clients have overpaid for something previously. This makes them overly cautious about scope and cost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you think you may have a Cost Conscious Client on your hands, don’t be afraid to ask about their previous projects and the typical budget.

However, there is a flow to most meetings that helps improve rapport and communication. Let\u0026#39;s dig into the first two points on my First Meeting Checklist: Connect and Align.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eT\u003cstrong\u003ehe First Step Of A First Meeting: Connect\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmall talk: you either love it or you hate it. Whether you’re meeting in person, on the phone, or in any other situation, you’re going to spend a few minutes building rapport.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it may seem a little frivolous at the outset, this period of connection plays an important role. Building rapport sets the groundwork for the rest of the meeting. It’s your chance to profile the person in a casual way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you start to connect with your meeting partner, ask questions that help you dig a little deeper into who they are and what they need. Where did they go to school? What are they educated in? What has their work experience been like? Do they have a family? This is all stuff you can use later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe connection stage of a meeting creates a tone that will carry you through the rest of the conversation. It may be tempting to rush right into the meat of the conversation, but don’t skip this step!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eT\u003cstrong\u003ehe Second Step Of A First Meeting: Align\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe goal of this segment is to answer the question “what are we both trying to get out of this meeting?” Additionally, you want to find out what it is you need to put a proposal together. Identify the reason for the meeting, and clarify what the outcome should be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the point to decide how long the meeting will last. You can say something like, “I have an hour for this meeting, but if we need more time I can reschedule the other meeting.” I often find that after an hour or so your attention starts to wane. If you’re listening and engaging, an hour is a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is also the time to clarify the potential client’s goals. Ask them directly: “If you had the perfect partner for this project, what would they look like?” Listen to what they have to say, and ask clarifying questions. You want to learn what’s important to them, and what the main purchasing decision is for each person present.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs your potential client outlines what they need in a partner, make a note about how you can address each need. This is valuable, because some clients will have needs that you simply can’t meet. If there’s a problem you can’t overcome, you don’t want to waste time putting together a proposal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Third Step Of A First Meeting: Clarify\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis step is where you show off your listening skills and confirm what your potential client has already revealed. This process should be concise and straight to the point. Read back what they’ve said to you in the form of a short summary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClarifying shows that you’re a great listener while validating everything the other person has said. It also makes a great opening sentence for your proposal: “You’ve asked us to…” It reinforces the idea that you’re sharp. You’re professional. You’re not a designer – you’re a consultant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693881fedbce6e_image-blog-tn-the-anatomy-of-a-first-meeting-2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Fourth Step Of A First Meeting: Ask\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s time to ask some important questions. First, find out what that person is looking for in a proposal. Do they want case studies? Do they want an outline of your process? Do they want to know about your pricing structure? Do they want you to lay out a schedule? Do they want all of the above, plus more? This is where you find out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis part of the meeting is also your opportunity to ask, “what will it take for you to buy from me?” It’s up to you whether you ask this question in every meeting. If things are going perfectly and no one is raising any objections, it might not be necessary. However, this question will reveal exactly where you and your potential client are aligned. The more you know what they’re looking for in a partner, the more likely you are to make a sale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing the ask portion of your meeting wisely also keeps you from being put on the defense for objections. For example, I get objections on cost quite often. As soon as I feel that an objection may come up, I’ll slip in, “I’m not sure you can afford our services.” They’ll start making up reasons why they can afford you. Use this part of the meeting to redirect to reduce the impact of objections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eT\u003cstrong\u003ehe Final Step Of A First Meeting: Next Steps\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eTransition from the ask section of your meeting by clearly asking your client “would you like us to put a proposal together?” If they say yes, or (even better) if they’ve asked you to begin with, it’s time to move onto your next steps. Find out more about what they need. Do they need a proposal by the end of the week? Are they looking for something specific?

However, there is a flow to most meetings that helps improve rapport and communication. Let\u0026#39;s dig into the first two points on my First Meeting Checklist: Connect and Align.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eT\u003cstrong\u003ehe First Step Of A First Meeting: Connect\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eSmall talk: you either love it or you hate it. Whether you’re meeting in person, on the phone, or in any other situation, you’re going to spend a few minutes building rapport.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile it may seem a little frivolous at the outset, this period of connection plays an important role. Building rapport sets the groundwork for the rest of the meeting. It’s your chance to profile the person in a casual way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs you start to connect with your meeting partner, ask questions that help you dig a little deeper into who they are and what they need. Where did they go to school? What are they educated in? What has their work experience been like? Do they have a family? This is all stuff you can use later.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe connection stage of a meeting creates a tone that will carry you through the rest of the conversation. It may be tempting to rush right into the meat of the conversation, but don’t skip this step!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eT\u003cstrong\u003ehe Second Step Of A First Meeting: Align\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe goal of this segment is to answer the question “what are we both trying to get out of this meeting?” Additionally, you want to find out what it is you need to put a proposal together. Identify the reason for the meeting, and clarify what the outcome should be.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is the point to decide how long the meeting will last. You can say something like, “I have an hour for this meeting, but if we need more time I can reschedule the other meeting.” I often find that after an hour or so your attention starts to wane. If you’re listening and engaging, an hour is a long time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is also the time to clarify the potential client’s goals. Ask them directly: “If you had the perfect partner for this project, what would they look like?” Listen to what they have to say, and ask clarifying questions. You want to learn what’s important to them, and what the main purchasing decision is for each person present.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs your potential client outlines what they need in a partner, make a note about how you can address each need. This is valuable, because some clients will have needs that you simply can’t meet. If there’s a problem you can’t overcome, you don’t want to waste time putting together a proposal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Third Step Of A First Meeting: Clarify\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis step is where you show off your listening skills and confirm what your potential client has already revealed. This process should be concise and straight to the point. Read back what they’ve said to you in the form of a short summary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eClarifying shows that you’re a great listener while validating everything the other person has said. It also makes a great opening sentence for your proposal: “You’ve asked us to…” It reinforces the idea that you’re sharp. You’re professional. You’re not a designer – you’re a consultant.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693881fedbce6e_image-blog-tn-the-anatomy-of-a-first-meeting-2.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Fourth Step Of A First Meeting: Ask\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s time to ask some important questions. First, find out what that person is looking for in a proposal. Do they want case studies? Do they want an outline of your process? Do they want to know about your pricing structure? Do they want you to lay out a schedule? Do they want all of the above, plus more? This is where you find out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis part of the meeting is also your opportunity to ask, “what will it take for you to buy from me?” It’s up to you whether you ask this question in every meeting. If things are going perfectly and no one is raising any objections, it might not be necessary. However, this question will reveal exactly where you and your potential client are aligned. The more you know what they’re looking for in a partner, the more likely you are to make a sale.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing the ask portion of your meeting wisely also keeps you from being put on the defense for objections. For example, I get objections on cost quite often. As soon as I feel that an objection may come up, I’ll slip in, “I’m not sure you can afford our services.” They’ll start making up reasons why they can afford you. Use this part of the meeting to redirect to reduce the impact of objections.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eT\u003cstrong\u003ehe Final Step Of A First Meeting: Next Steps\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eTransition from the ask section of your meeting by clearly asking your client “would you like us to put a proposal together?” If they say yes, or (even better) if they’ve asked you to begin with, it’s time to move onto your next steps. Find out more about what they need. Do they need a proposal by the end of the week? Are they looking for something specific? Make a note of it, then make it happen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eChris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

      "content_html": "\u003cdiv id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe difference between charging a price that seems “safe” and “comfortable” versus requiring your clients to pay your full value is confidence. What school you went to, where you live, your previous experience; none of that really matters. What matters is having the confidence to place a high value on what you do. Do you have that confidence? If you’re here, and if you’re like many other designers, you probably don’t. Why are designers almost “programmed” to undervalue and undersell what they do? Here’s what I’ve come up with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eW\u003cstrong\u003ehy You Don’t Have The Confidence to Ask for More\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may be a humble person in most areas of your life, but to start making what you’re worth you have to start building your confidence. Confidence starts on the inside. And yeah, it’s easier said than done, but one of the first things you can do is take a closer look at your mindset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStart by reading the following sentence: “People regularly pay $5000 for logos that aren’t much different than the ones you’re making for $50.” What’s your internal dialogue saying? How are you speaking to yourself? Are you saying things like “that’s impossible”? What about, “Maybe other designers could do that, but there’s no way I could pull it off”?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think sometimes we need permission from somebody that we trust and respect to just let ourselves ask for what we’re worth. We get used to boxing ourselves into a tight space, internally using words that we may not even be aware we’re using. Maybe you describe yourself by what you used to do (“I’m an ex-marine, I’m a former teacher”) instead of what you currently do. You don’t feel comfortable calling yourself what you are: an innovative, inventive designer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs those thoughts echo around in your head, another issue starts to arise: imposter syndrome. You may have heard of this before. It’s rampant in creative world. You feel like you’re an imposter. You feel like you’re not qualified to do what you’re doing, that you’re just pretending. You’re apologetic, waiting for someone to discover you and call you out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe spend a lot of time comparing ourselves to others. In one sense, that’s okay, because it’s how we grow. But in another sense, comparison can be our biggest enemy. You say, “I don’t know myself as a professional. I don’t know any other professional designers. I don’t know what it means to be a professional designer, but I know I’m not that guy. I didn’t go to a private art school. I don’t live in an area known for design. I didn’t do this, that, and the other thing. Because of that, I’m just pretending to be a professional.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re constantly receiving these types of messages, of course you’re not going to feel confident in charging more for your design. How could you? If you’re an “imposter,” charging more puts you at greater risk of exposure. Even more, raising your prices feels wrong. You don’t feel right charging what a “professional” would, because you see yourself as an amateur.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eTransitioning out of your current mindset into a mindset of confidence will transform how you approach your clients, your business, and your pricing structure. I’d like to challenge you to pay closer attention to your inner dialogue. What are you telling yourself right now after reading this? Are they the words of a professional, or someone who sees themselves as an imposter?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eChris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

      "content_html": "\u003cdiv id=\"readability-page-1\" class=\"page\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe difference between charging a price that seems “safe” and “comfortable” versus requiring your clients to pay your full value is confidence. What school you went to, where you live, your previous experience; none of that really matters. What matters is having the confidence to place a high value on what you do. Do you have that confidence? If you’re here, and if you’re like many other designers, you probably don’t. Why are designers almost “programmed” to undervalue and undersell what they do? Here’s what I’ve come up with.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eW\u003cstrong\u003ehy You Don’t Have The Confidence to Ask for More\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou may be a humble person in most areas of your life, but to start making what you’re worth you have to start building your confidence. Confidence starts on the inside. And yeah, it’s easier said than done, but one of the first things you can do is take a closer look at your mindset.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStart by reading the following sentence: “People regularly pay $5000 for logos that aren’t much different than the ones you’re making for $50.” What’s your internal dialogue saying? How are you speaking to yourself? Are you saying things like “that’s impossible”? What about, “Maybe other designers could do that, but there’s no way I could pull it off”?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think sometimes we need permission from somebody that we trust and respect to just let ourselves ask for what we’re worth. We get used to boxing ourselves into a tight space, internally using words that we may not even be aware we’re using. Maybe you describe yourself by what you used to do (“I’m an ex-marine, I’m a former teacher”) instead of what you currently do. You don’t feel comfortable calling yourself what you are: an innovative, inventive designer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs those thoughts echo around in your head, another issue starts to arise: imposter syndrome. You may have heard of this before. It’s rampant in creative world. You feel like you’re an imposter. You feel like you’re not qualified to do what you’re doing, that you’re just pretending. You’re apologetic, waiting for someone to discover you and call you out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe spend a lot of time comparing ourselves to others. In one sense, that’s okay, because it’s how we grow. But in another sense, comparison can be our biggest enemy. You say, “I don’t know myself as a professional. I don’t know any other professional designers. I don’t know what it means to be a professional designer, but I know I’m not that guy. I didn’t go to a private art school. I don’t live in an area known for design. I didn’t do this, that, and the other thing. Because of that, I’m just pretending to be a professional.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you’re constantly receiving these types of messages, of course you’re not going to feel confident in charging more for your design. How could you? If you’re an “imposter,” charging more puts you at greater risk of exposure. Even more, raising your prices feels wrong. You don’t feel right charging what a “professional” would, because you see yourself as an amateur.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eTransitioning out of your current mindset into a mindset of confidence will transform how you approach your clients, your business, and your pricing structure. I’d like to challenge you to pay closer attention to your inner dialogue. What are you telling yourself right now after reading this? Are they the words of a professional, or someone who sees themselves as an imposter?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eChris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

Do you consider yourself a confident person? If you don’t, it’s time to start changing how you think. Confidence isn’t an innate trait. It’s something you can (and really need to) develop. In my experience, there are three components that go into building confidence. The first of those is \u003cem\u003ebuilding a foundation\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you do better than anyone else?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m not a particularly outgoing person, and I can’t say that confidence has come naturally to me. But one of the biggest things that helped me become a more confident person was realizing that I was good at design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI loved to draw from an early age, and decided to pursue design as a profession. When I did, I found out that I had natural talent there and was able to develop it quickly. Realizing that gave me something to latch on to: I was a designer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou have something you’re naturally great at, too. It may not be design. It could be that you’re great at talking with people, great at presenting and teaching ideas, or amazing at strategizing. Let that be what you focus your lens on. It’s the thing that makes you different, and it’s your foundation for growing confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eT\u003cstrong\u003ehe inside reflects outward‍\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t see yourself as something, it’s incredibly hard to sell yourself as that thing. However, if you start to see yourself as something inwardly, an amazing thing happens: you start to project it outwardly as well. People start to see you as that thing, and approach you on that level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re comfortable with who you are, people gravitate towards you. I see it particularly often with people who are spiritual or religious. They’re not about their money or possessions, they’re not fronting: they’re just comfortable in their skin. Other people feel that comfort, and are drawn to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat kind of authenticity is a huge asset in sales. When you’re comfortable with who you are, you are able to present yourself to others with confidence. You know what you’re good at, and you can express that clearly and honestly. What you feel about yourself inwardly reflects outwardly, and the people you’re selling to will respond.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eS\u003cstrong\u003etart building self-confidence now\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf it’s your goal to be more confident and comfortable with yourself, knowing what you’re good at is the first step. So what is it you love to do? What comes naturally? What can you do easily that others seem to struggle with? Start building your foundation there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe thing you’re best at might not necessarily be the thing you’ve envisioned yourself doing. That’s okay! The more honest you are about where your strengths lie, the more seamlessly you’ll be able to move to a position of confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreat confidence begins with a great foundation.

Do you consider yourself a confident person? If you don’t, it’s time to start changing how you think. Confidence isn’t an innate trait. It’s something you can (and really need to) develop. In my experience, there are three components that go into building confidence. The first of those is \u003cem\u003ebuilding a foundation\u003c/em\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you do better than anyone else?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m not a particularly outgoing person, and I can’t say that confidence has come naturally to me. But one of the biggest things that helped me become a more confident person was realizing that I was good at design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI loved to draw from an early age, and decided to pursue design as a profession. When I did, I found out that I had natural talent there and was able to develop it quickly. Realizing that gave me something to latch on to: I was a designer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou have something you’re naturally great at, too. It may not be design. It could be that you’re great at talking with people, great at presenting and teaching ideas, or amazing at strategizing. Let that be what you focus your lens on. It’s the thing that makes you different, and it’s your foundation for growing confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eT\u003cstrong\u003ehe inside reflects outward‍\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you don’t see yourself as something, it’s incredibly hard to sell yourself as that thing. However, if you start to see yourself as something inwardly, an amazing thing happens: you start to project it outwardly as well. People start to see you as that thing, and approach you on that level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you’re comfortable with who you are, people gravitate towards you. I see it particularly often with people who are spiritual or religious. They’re not about their money or possessions, they’re not fronting: they’re just comfortable in their skin. Other people feel that comfort, and are drawn to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat kind of authenticity is a huge asset in sales. When you’re comfortable with who you are, you are able to present yourself to others with confidence. You know what you’re good at, and you can express that clearly and honestly. What you feel about yourself inwardly reflects outwardly, and the people you’re selling to will respond.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eS\u003cstrong\u003etart building self-confidence now\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf it’s your goal to be more confident and comfortable with yourself, knowing what you’re good at is the first step. So what is it you love to do? What comes naturally? What can you do easily that others seem to struggle with? Start building your foundation there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe thing you’re best at might not necessarily be the thing you’ve envisioned yourself doing. That’s okay! The more honest you are about where your strengths lie, the more seamlessly you’ll be able to move to a position of confidence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreat confidence begins with a great foundation.

Knowing the answers to these questions is crucial to getting where you want to be in business and life. In my experience, being a great listener comes down to three principles: listening to understand, asking great questions, and validating what you hear. Here’s my take on how to leverage these three principles in your next conversation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eListening Principle #1 – Listening to Understand\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow much do you really understand when you listen to someone? It may be less than you think. Here’s an exercise I recommend to really focus in on where your listening skills are at. Sit down with someone and have them tell you something. Anything.

Find places in your conversation to ask open-ended questions that draw out more about what the other person is trying to say. Simply asking “why” at the right point can uncover information that’s crucial to understanding their point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis is just as important in sales as it is in your personal conversations. Listen to what a client is telling you, and be persistent in digging deeper with “why” questions.

Validating what they say reassures them that you’re listening and truly want to understand what they’re saying. How do you validate someone? It’s as simple as saying, “So, what I’m hearing is \u003cem\u003ethis\u003c/em\u003e.” Repeat back what they’re saying and make them feel heard. I think validation is such an important part of listening, particularly because so many clients are used to working with people who just don’t care to hear what they have to say. If they’re always fighting with internal teams or working with a director who doesn’t listen, talking with someone who really takes the effort to hear them is very refreshing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot only does validating help make sure you understand what someone is saying, it also makes other people feel good. It’s as simple as that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch4\u003eThe Bottom Line\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp\u003eBeing a great listener is a skill that you can develop.

If they’re always fighting with internal teams or working with a director who doesn’t listen, talking with someone who really takes the effort to hear them is very refreshing. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNot only does validating help make sure you understand what someone is saying, it also makes other people feel good.

How many times have you had to ask someone to repeat something because you weren’t fully engaged in what they were saying?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eListening isn’t an ability you’re born with. It’s something you can learn to do. As I’ve worked to be a better listener, I’ve found that improving myself in three areas has made a huge difference.

Patience: If you’re that guy who’s always filling in the blanks for someone, it might be time to ask yourself how patient you really are. Filling in the pauses of a conversation is sometimes instinctual. It may feel like you’re doing it to show the other person that you’re engaged and listening. But for many of us, it has a lot less to do with being supportive and a lot more to do with hurrying the other person to the end of their sentence.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eActive listening means cultivating the patience to put your desire to respond on the back burner. Practice patience to give the person you’re listening to the chance to fully express themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e2. Confidence: How do you feel when you’re facilitating a conversation? Actively listening to a group of people can be intimidating. Instead of asking questions, sitting back, and absorbing the answers, you waste brain power by worrying about what you’re going to do next. Before you know it you’re asking people to repeat themselves and still not fully understanding what they’re saying.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhether it’s facilitating a group or talking one on one with a potential new client, active listening requires confidence. It means turning off your own thoughts to leave space for what they’re saying. Practicing this in comfortable conversations can help you build up confidence in more intimidating conversations. As your confidence grows, so will your ability to listen in stressful situations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e‍\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e3. Presence: If you end a conversation with a clearer idea of what you’re going to eat for dinner than what the other person wants or needs, it’s time to work on being present. Being a great listener means being actively involved in the conversation. It means tuning out distractions (even closing your eyes if that helps) and being absolutely present.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePresence in a conversation may not come naturally. It’ll also feel really exhausting. If you do it right, you’ll leave the conversation feeling drained.
