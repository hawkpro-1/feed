Every company accelerated their digital and online efforts, while simultaneously moving to remote development. Innovation by driving developer productivity was top of mind for nearly every IT executive we spoke to. Many asked us about Alphabet\u0026#39;s long track record of innovation. From Google search to Waymo\u0026amp;#8217;s driverless cars,\u0026amp;#160; is there a secret to developing the next big thing?\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The answer is simple: 10X thinking. Look for solutions that help customers drive 10X improvements, through a series of smaller increments that compound to a large impact over time. At Google Cloud, we follow a similar philosophy to help our customers become innovative technology companies. In recent times, we\u0026amp;#8217;ve worked closely with partners, customers, and developers on services that help unlock 10X improvements in developer productivity.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Six years ago, we introduced a managed Kubernetes service, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). This year, we added \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-gke-autopilot\u0026#34;\u0026gt;GKE Autopilot\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, which revolutionized Kubernetes management by eliminating all node management operations. Likewise, our \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/run\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Cloud Run\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; serverless platform was the first service of its kind, allowing developers to go beyond running small bits of code and run full applications in a serverless environment. From September 2020 to September 2021, Cloud Run deployments more than quadrupled. More recently, we co-founded the \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://openssf.org/\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Open Source Security Foundation\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; and began working on secure continuous Integration and delivery (CI/CD) services a year or so ahead of the cybersecurity threats that made it to headlines.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Here are the top developer challenges that customers asked us to solve in 2021:\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Driving distributed developer productivity\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Securing the software supply chain\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Simplifying running of cloud-native applications\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ul\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Read on for more insights.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Driving distributed developer productivity\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;A critical prerequisite for innovation is time. Investments in developer productivity free developers to work on the important things. Traditionally, developers have spent hours downloading and installing tools to their local environments, updating them with the latest versions, or dependencies. \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/editor-overview\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Cloud Shell Editor\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; is a full remote development environment with a growing set of built in security capabilities. It comes with developer tools pre-installed, including MySql, Kubernetes, Docker, minikube, Skaffold, etc. Developers just needed a web browser and internet connection to be productive. Developers now have access to \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/cloud-shell-tutorials/tutorials\u0026#34;\u0026gt;tutorials\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; right from Cloud Shell Editor, and can try code samples directly in \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/developers-practitioners/run-code-samples-directly-google-cloud-documentation\u0026#34;\u0026gt;our documentation\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.

Every company accelerated their digital and online efforts, while simultaneously moving to remote development.

Blameless postmortems originated as an aerospace practice in the mid-20th century, so it was particularly fitting that they came full circle to be used at a company that melded cutting edge aerospace work with the development of a communications platform and the world\u0026#39;s first stratospheric temporospatial software defined network. The use of postmortems became a standardizing factor across Loon\u0026#39;s teams\u0026amp;#8212; from avionics and manufacturing, to flight operations, to software platforms and network service. This blog post discusses how Loon moved from a heterogeneous approach to postmortems to eventually standardize and share this practice across the organization\u0026amp;#8212; a shift that helped the company move from R\u0026amp;amp;D to commercial service in 2020.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;Background\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Postmortems\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Many industries have adopted the use of postmortems\u0026amp;#8212; they are fairly common in high-risk fields where mistakes can be fatal or extremely expensive. Postmortems are also widespread in industries and projects where bad processes or assumptions can incur expensive project development costs and avoiding repeat mistakes is a priority. Individual industries and organizations often develop their own postmortem standards or templates so that postmortems are easier to create and digest across teams.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Blameless postmortems likely originated in the healthcare and aerospace industries in the mid-20th century.

As the first company to attempt anything like this, Loon dealt with a number of systems that were complex, challenging, or novel: superpressure balloons designed to stay aloft for hundreds of days, wind-dependant steering, a software defined network consisting of constantly moving nodes, and extremes of temperature and weather at 20km above Earth\u0026#39;s surface.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Prod Team\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The initial high-risk operations of Loon\u0026#39;s mission were avionic: could we launch and steer balloons carrying a networking payload long enough to reach and serve the targeted region? As such, the earliest failure reports within Loon (which weren\u0026#39;t officially called \u0026amp;#34;postmortems\u0026amp;#34; at the time) mostly involved balloon construction or flight, and drew on the experience of team members who had worked in the Avionics, Reliability Engineering, and/or Flight Safety fields. As Loon\u0026#39;s systems evolved and matured, they started to require operational reliability, as well. Just before graduating from a purely R\u0026amp;amp;D project in Google\u0026#39;s \u0026amp;#34;moonshot factory\u0026amp;#34; incubator X to a company with commercial goals, Loon started building a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team known internally as Prod Team.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In order to effectively offer internet connectivity to users, Loon had to solve network serving failures with the same rigor as hardware failures.

The Flight Operations Team, which handled the day-to-day operations of steering launched balloons, captured in-flight issues in a tracking system. The tracking system was part of the anomaly resolution system devised to identify and resolve root cause problems. Seeking to complement the anomaly resolution system, the Flight Operations Team incorporated the SRE software team\u0026#39;s postmortem format for incidents that needed further investigation\u0026amp;#8212; for example, failure to avoid a storm system, deviations from the simulated (expected) flight path that led to an incident, and flight operator actions that directly or indirectly caused an incident. Given that most incidents spanned multiple teams (e.g., when automation failed to catch an incorrect command sent by a flight operator, which resulted in a hardware failure), utilizing a consistent postmortem format across teams simplified collaboration.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;The Aviation and Systems Safety Team, which focused on safety related to the flight system and flight process, also brought their own tradition and best practices of postmortems. Their motto, \u0026amp;#34;Own our Safety\u0026amp;#34;, brought a commitment to continually improving safety performance and building a positive safety culture across the company. This was one of the strengths of Loon\u0026#39;s culture: all the organizations were aligned not just on our audacious vision to \u0026amp;#34;connect people everywhere\u0026amp;#34;, but also on doing so safely and effectively. However, because industry standards for postmortems and how to handle different types of problems varied across teams, there was some divergence in process. We proactively encouraged teams to share postmortems between teams, between orgs, and across the company so that anyone could provide feedback and insight into an incident. In that way, anyone at Loon could contribute to a postmortem, see how an incident was handled, and learn about the breadth of challenges that Loon was solving.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Challenges\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;While everyone agreed that postmortems were an important practice, in a fast moving start-up culture, it was a struggle to comprehensively follow through on action items. This probably comes as no surprise to developers in similar environments\u0026amp;#8212; when the platform or services that require investment are rapidly changing or being replaced, it\u0026#39;s hard to spend resources on not repeating the same mistakes. Ideally, we would have prioritized postmortems that focused on best practices and learnings that were applicable to multiple generations of the platform, but those weren\u0026#39;t easy to identify at the time of each incident.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Even though the company was not especially large, the novelty of Loon\u0026#39;s platform and interconnectedness of its operations made determining which team was responsible for writing a postmortem and investigating root causes difficult. For example, a 20 minute service disruption on the ground might be caused by a loss of connectivity from the balloon to the backhaul network, a pointing error with the antennae on the payload, insufficient battery levels, or wind that temporarily blew the balloon out of range. Actual causes could be quite nuanced, and often were attributable to interactions between multiple sub-systems. Thus, we had a chicken-and-egg problem: which team should start the postmortem and investigation, and when should they hand off the postmortem to the teams that likely owned the faulty system or process? Not all teams had a culture of postmortems, so the process could stall depending on the system where the root cause originated. For that reason, Loon\u0026#39;s Prod Team/SREs advocated for a company-wide blameless postmortem culture.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Much of how Loon used postmortems, especially in software development and Prod Team, was in line with SRE industry standards. In the early days of Loon, however, there were no service level objectives or agreements (SLO/As). As Loon was an R\u0026amp;amp;D project, we wrote postmortems when a test network failed to boot after launch, or when performance didn\u0026#39;t meet the team\u0026#39;s predictions, rather than for \u0026amp;#34;service outages\u0026amp;#34;.

Blameless postmortems originated as an aerospace practice in the mid-20th century, so it was particularly fitting that they came full circle to be used at a company that melded cutting edge aerospace work with the development of a communications platform and the world\u0026#39;s first stratospheric temporospatial software defined network. The use of postmortems became a standardizing factor across Loon\u0026#39;s teamsâ from avionics and manufacturing, to flight operations, to software platforms and network service. This blog post discusses how Loon moved from a heterogeneous approach to postmortems to eventually standardize and share this practice across the organizationâ a shift that helped the company move from R\u0026amp;D to commercial service in 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePostmortems\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany industries have adopted the use of postmortemsâ they are fairly common in high-risk fields where mistakes can be fatal or extremely expensive.

Blameless postmortems originated as an aerospace practice in the mid-20th century, so it was particularly fitting that they came full circle to be used at a company that melded cutting edge aerospace work with the development of a communications platform and the world's first stratospheric temporospatial software defined network. The use of postmortems became a standardizing factor across Loon's teamsâ from avionics and manufacturing, to flight operations, to software platforms and network service. This blog post discusses how Loon moved from a heterogeneous approach to postmortems to eventually standardize and share this practice across the organizationâ a shift that helped the company move from R\u0026amp;D to commercial service in 2020.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBackground\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePostmortems\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMany industries have adopted the use of postmortemsâ they are fairly common in high-risk fields where mistakes can be fatal or extremely expensive. Postmortems are also widespread in industries and projects where bad processes or assumptions can incur expensive project development costs and avoiding repeat mistakes is a priority. Individual industries and organizations often develop their own postmortem standards or templates so that postmortems are easier to create and digest across teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBlameless postmortems likely originated in the healthcare and aerospace industries in the mid-20th century. Because of the high cost of failure, these industries needed to create a culture of transparency and continuous improvement that could only come from openly discussing failure. As the original SRE book states, blameless postmortems are key to \"an environment where every 'mistake' is seen as an opportunity to strengthen the system.\"Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe goal of a postmortem is to document an incident or event in order to foster learning from it, both among the affected teams and beyond. The postmortem usually includes a timeline of what happened, the solutions implemented, the incident's impact, the investigation into root causes, and changes or follow-ups to stop it from happening again. To facilitate learning, SRE's postmortem format includes both what went wellâ acknowledging the successes that should be maintained and expandedâ and what went poorly and needs to be changed. In this way, postmortem action items are key to prioritizing work that ensures the same failures don't happen again.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLoon\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eLoon aimed to supply internet access to unserved and underserved populations around the world by providing connectivity via stratospheric balloons. These high altitude âflying cell towersâ covered a much wider footprint than a terrestrial tower, and could be deployed (and repositioned) into the most remote corners of the earth without expensive overland transportation and installation. As the first company to attempt anything like this, Loon dealt with a number of systems that were complex, challenging, or novel: superpressure balloons designed to stay aloft for hundreds of days, wind-dependant steering, a software defined network consisting of constantly moving nodes, and extremes of temperature and weather at 20km above Earth's surface.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eProd Team\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe initial high-risk operations of Loon's mission were avionic: could we launch and steer balloons carrying a networking payload long enough to reach and serve the targeted region? As such, the earliest failure reports within Loon (which weren't officially called \"postmortems\" at the time) mostly involved balloon construction or flight, and drew on the experience of team members who had worked in the Avionics, Reliability Engineering, and/or Flight Safety fields. As Loon's systems evolved and matured, they started to require operational reliability, as well. Just before graduating from a purely R\u0026amp;D project in Google's \"moonshot factory\" incubator X to a company with commercial goals, Loon started building a Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team known internally as Prod Team.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn order to effectively offer internet connectivity to users, Loon had to solve network serving failures with the same rigor as hardware failures. Prod Team took the lead on a number of practices to improve network reliability. The Prod Team had three primary goals:Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnsure that the fleet's automation, management, and safety-critical systems were built and operated to meet the high safety bar of the aviation industry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eLead the integration of the communications services (e.g., LTE) end to end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eOwn the mission of fielding and providing a reliable commercial service (Loon Library) in the real world.Â Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePostmortems at Loon\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe Early Days\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003ePostmortems were one tool for reaching Prod Team's (SRE's) goals. Prod Team often interacted with SREs in other infrastructure support teams that the Loon service connected to, such as the team developing the Evolved Packet Core (EPC), our telco partner counterparts, and teams that handle edge network connectivity. Postmortems provided a common tool for sharing incident information across all these teams, and could even span multiple companies when upstream problems impacted customers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Loon, postmortems served the following goals:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eDocument and transcribe the events, actions, and remedies related to an incident.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eProvide a feedback loop to rectify problems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIndicate where to build better safeguards and alerts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eBreak down silos between teams in order to facilitate cross-functional knowledge sharing and accelerate development.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIdentify macro themes and blind spots over the longer term.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe combination of aerospace and high tech brought two strong practices of writing postmortems, but also the challenge of how to own, investigate, or follow up on problems that crossed those boundaries, or when it wasn't clear where the system fault lay.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLoon's teams across hardware, software, and operations orgs used postmortems, as was standard practice in their fields for incident response. The Flight Operations Team, which handled the day-to-day operations of steering launched balloons, captured in-flight issues in a tracking system. The tracking system was part of the anomaly resolution system devised to identify and resolve root cause problems. Seeking to complement the anomaly resolution system, the Flight Operations Team incorporated the SRE software team's postmortem format for incidents that needed further investigationâ for example, failure to avoid a storm system, deviations from the simulated (expected) flight path that led to an incident, and flight operator actions that directly or indirectly caused an incident. Given that most incidents spanned multiple teams (e.g., when automation failed to catch an incorrect command sent by a flight operator, which resulted in a hardware failure), utilizing a consistent postmortem format across teams simplified collaboration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Aviation and Systems Safety Team, which focused on safety related to the flight system and flight process, also brought their own tradition and best practices of postmortems. Their motto, \"Own our Safety\", brought a commitment to continually improving safety performance and building a positive safety culture across the company. This was one of the strengths of Loon's culture: all the organizations were aligned not just on our audacious vision to \"connect people everywhere\", but also on doing so safely and effectively. However, because industry standards for postmortems and how to handle different types of problems varied across teams, there was some divergence in process. We proactively encouraged teams to share postmortems between teams, between orgs, and across the company so that anyone could provide feedback and insight into an incident. In that way, anyone at Loon could contribute to a postmortem, see how an incident was handled, and learn about the breadth of challenges that Loon was solving.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eChallenges\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile everyone agreed that postmortems were an important practice, in a fast moving start-up culture, it was a struggle to comprehensively follow through on action items. This probably comes as no surprise to developers in similar environmentsâ when the platform or services that require investment are rapidly changing or being replaced, it's hard to spend resources on not repeating the same mistakes. Ideally, we would have prioritized postmortems that focused on best practices and learnings that were applicable to multiple generations of the platform, but those weren't easy to identify at the time of each incident.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though the company was not especially large, the novelty of Loon's platform and interconnectedness of its operations made determining which team was responsible for writing a postmortem and investigating root causes difficult. For example, a 20 minute service disruption on the ground might be caused by a loss of connectivity from the balloon to the backhaul network, a pointing error with the antennae on the payload, insufficient battery levels, or wind that temporarily blew the balloon out of range. Actual causes could be quite nuanced, and often were attributable to interactions between multiple sub-systems. Thus, we had a chicken-and-egg problem: which team should start the postmortem and investigation, and when should they hand off the postmortem to the teams that likely owned the faulty system or process? Not all teams had a culture of postmortems, so the process could stall depending on the system where the root cause originated. For that reason, Loon's Prod Team/SREs advocated for a company-wide blameless postmortem culture.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMuch of how Loon used postmortems, especially in software development and Prod Team, was in line with SRE industry standards. In the early days of Loon, however, there were no service level objectives or agreements (SLO/As). As Loon was an R\u0026amp;D project, we wrote postmortems when a test network failed to boot after launch, or when performance didn't meet the team's predictions, rather than for \"service outages\". Later on, when Loon supplied commercial service in disaster relief areas in Peru and Kenya, the Prod Team could more clearly identify the types of user-facing incidents that required postmortems due to failure to meet SLAs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eImproving and Standardizing Loon's Postmortem Processes\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eMoving Loon from an R\u0026amp;D model to the model of reliability and safety necessary for a commercial offering required more than simply performing postmortems. Sharing the postmortems openly and widely across Loon was critical to building a culture of continuous improvement and addressing root causes.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo increase cross-team awareness of incidents, in 2019 we instituted a Postmortem Working Group. In addition to reading and discussing recent postmortems from across the company, the goals of the working group were to make it easier to write postmortems, promote the practice of writing postmortems, increase sharing across teams, and discuss the findings of these incidents in order to learn the patterns of failure. Its founding goal was to \"\u003ci\u003eCultivate a postmortem culture in Loon to encourage thoughtful risk taking, to take advantage of mistakes, and to provide structure to support improvement over time.\u003c/i\u003e\" While the volume of postmortems could ebb and flow across weeks and months, over multiple years of commercial service we expected to be able to identify macro-trends that needed to be addressed with the cooperation of multiple teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to the Postmortem Working Group, we also created a postmortem mailing list and a repository of all postmortems, and presented a \"Lunch \u0026amp; Learn\" on blameless postmortems (see example slide below). Prod Team and several other teams' meetings had a standing agenda item to review postmortems of interest from across the company, and we sent a semi-annual email celebrating Loon's \"best-of\" recent incidents: the most interesting or educational outages.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-image_full_width\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-module h-c-page\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h-c-grid\"\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"loon.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/loon.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-paragraph\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rich-text\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce we had a standardized postmortem template in place, we could adopt and reuse it to document commercial service field tests. By recording a timeline and incidents, defining a process and space to determine root causes of problems, recording measurements and metrics, and providing the structure for action item tracking, we brought the benefits of postmortem retrospectives to prospective tasks.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Loon began commercial trials in countries like Peru and Kenya, we conducted numerous field tests. These tests required engineers from Loon and/or the telco partner to travel to remote locations to measure the strength of the LTE signal on the ground. Prod Team proactively used the postmortem template to document the field tests. It provided a useful format to record the log of test events, results that did and did not match expectations, and links to further investigations into those failures. As a cutting edge project in a highly variable operating environment, using the postmortem template as our default testing template was an acknowledgement that we were in a state of constant and rapid iteration and improvement. These trials took place in early to mid 2020, under the sudden specter of Covid and the subsequent shift towards working from home. The structured communications at the core of Loon's postmortem structure were particularly helpful as we moved from in-person coordination rooms to WFH.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat Loon Learned from Standardizing Postmortems\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003ePostmortems are widely used in various industries because they are effective. At Loon, we saw that even fast moving startups and R\u0026amp;D projects should invest early in a transparent and blameless postmortem culture. That culture should include a clear process for writing postmortems, clear guidelines for when to conduct a postmortem, and a staffed commitment to follow up on action items.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMeta-reviews across postmortems and outages revealed several trends.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe many points of failure we observed across the range of postmortems were indicative of both the complexity of Loon's systems and the complexity of some of its supporting infrastructure. Postmortems are equally adept at finding flaky tests and fragile processes vs. hardware failures or satellite network outages. These are complexities familiar to many startups, where postmortems can help manage the tradeoff between making changes safely vs. moving quickly and trying many new things.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLoon was still operating a superhero culture: across a wide range of issues, a small set of experts were repeatedly called upon to fix the system. This dynamic is common in startups, and not meant as a pejorative, but was markedly different from the system maturity that many of Prod Team/SRE were used to. Once we identified this pattern, our plan for commercial service was to staff a 24x7 oncall rotation, complemented by Program Managers driving intention processes to de-risk production\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePostmortems provided a space to ask questions like, \"What other issues could pop up in this realm?\", which prompted us to solve for the broader case of problems rather than specific problems we'd already seen. This practice also stopped people from brushing off problems in the name of development speed, or from dismissing issues because they \"just concerned a prototype\".\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTips and Takeaways\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile the specifics of Loon's journey to standardize postmortems tell the story of one company, we have some tips and takeaways that should be applicable at most organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTip 1: Adopting a blameless postmortem culture requires everyone to participate\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlthough the initiative of writing postmortems often originates with a software team, if you want every team to adopt the practice, we suggest trying the following:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eGive a talk about postmortems and how and why they could benefit all.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eForm a postmortem working group.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eInvite people representing different teams to be part of the postmortem working group. They will give insights into what could work better for their respective teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eDon't make the postmortem working group responsible for writing the postmortemsâ this approach doesn't scale. Reviewing and consulting on postmortems may be in scope of their duties, especially while new teams are adopting this practice.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTip 2: Define a lightweight postmortem process\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eEspecially during adoption, you want teams to see the benefits of postmortems, not the burden of writing them. Creating a postmortem template with minimum requirements can be helpful.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTip 3: Define a clear owner for postmortems\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWho should write a postmortem and when? For software teams with an oncall rotation, the answer is clear: the person who was oncall during the incident is the owner, and we write postmortems when a service interruption breached SLOs. But when the service has no SLOs, or when a team doesn't have an oncall rotation, you need defined criteria. Bonus points if the outage involves multiple systems and teams. The following exercises can help in this area:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eReflect on these topics from the point of view of each team, and from the point of view of the interaction between teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor each team, define what type of incident(s) should trigger a postmortem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin the team, define who should own writing each postmortem. Avoid putting the entire burden on the same person frequently; consider forming a rotation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTip 4: Encourage blameless postmortems and make people proud of them\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eConsider some activities that can help foster the blameless postmortem culture:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eWrite a report of the best postmortems over a given period and circulate them broadly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eConduct training on how to write postmortems.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eTrain managers and encourage them to prioritize postmortems on their teams.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen Loon shut down, addressing all these points was still a work in progress. We don't have a teachable moment of âthis postmortem process will solve your failuresâ, because postmortems don't do that. However, we could see where postmortems stopped us from needing to deal with the same failures repeatedlyâ¦ and where sometimes we did experience repeat incidents because the AIs from the first postmortem weren't prioritized enough. And so this piece of writingâ effectively, a postmortem on Loon's postmortemsâserves up a familiar lesson: postmortems work, but only as well as they are widely accepted and adhered to.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e",

When users canât access your application, if itâs slow to respond, or it behaves unexpectedly, they donât get the value that you intend to provide. Thatâs why at Google we like to say that \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/workbook/reaching-beyond/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003ci\u003ereliability is the most important feature of any system\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. Its impact can be seen all the way to the bottom line, as downtime comes with steep costsâto revenue, to reputation, and to user loyalty.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the beginning of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.devops-research.com/research.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDevOps Research and Assessment\u003c/a\u003e (DORA) project, weâve recognized the importance of delivering a consistent experience to users. We measure this with the \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/using-the-four-keys-to-measure-your-devops-performance\"\u003eFour Key\u003c/a\u003e metricsâtwo metrics that track the velocity of deploying new releases, balanced against two that capture the initial stability of those releases. A team that rates well on all four metrics is not only good at shipping code, theyâre shipping code thatâs good.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, these four signals, which focus on the path to a deployment and its immediate effects, are less diagnostic of subsequent success throughout the lifespan of a release. In 2018, DORA began to study the ongoing stability of software delivered as a service (as typified by web applications), which we captured in an additional metric for availability, to explore the impact of technical operations on organizational performance. This year, we expanded our inquiry into this area, starting by renaming availability to reliability. Reliability (sometimes abbreviated as r9y) is a more general term that encompasses dimensions including response latency and content validity, as well as availability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/devops/state-of-devops/\"\u003e2021 State of DevOps Reportâs\u003c/a\u003e cluster analysis, teams were segmented into four groups based on the Four Key metrics of software delivery. At first glance, we found that the application of reliability practices is not directly correlated to software delivery performance âÂ  teams that score well on delivery metrics may not be the same as those who consistently practice modern operations. However, in combination, software delivery performance and reliability engineering exert a powerful influence on organizational outcomes: elite software delivery teams that also meet their reliability goals are 1.8 times more likely to report better business outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-image_full_width\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-module h-c-page\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h-c-grid\"\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"SRE.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/SRE.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-paragraph\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rich-text\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow Google achieves reliability: SRE\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn Googleâs early days, we took a traditional approach to technical operations; the bulk of the work involved manual interventions in reaction to discrete problems. However, as our products began to rapidly acquire users across the globe, we realized that this approach wasnât sustainable. It couldnât scale to match the increasing size and complexity of our systems, and even attempting to keep up would require an untenable investment in our operations workforce. So, for the past 15+ years, weâve been practicing and iterating on an approach called \u003ca href=\"http://sre.google\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSite Reliability Engineering\u003c/a\u003e (SRE).Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSRE provides a framework for measurement, prioritization, and information sharing to help teams balance between the velocity of feature releases and the predictable behavior of deployed services. It emphasizes the use of automation to reduce risk and to free up engineering capacity for strategic work. This may sound a lot like a description of DevOps; indeed, these disciplines have many shared values. That similarity meant that when, in 2016, Google published the \u003ca href=\"http://sre.google/books\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efirst book on Site Reliability Engineering\u003c/a\u003e, it made waves in the DevOps community as practitioners recognized a like-minded movement. It also caused some confusion: some have framed DevOps and SRE as being in conflict or competition with each other.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur view is that, having arisen from similar challenges and espousing similar objectives, DevOps and SRE can be mutually compatible. We posited that, metaphorically, â\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/uTEL8Ff1Zvk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eclass SRE implements DevOps\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e''âSRE provides a way to realize DevOps objectives. Inspired by these communitiesâ continued growth and ongoing exchange of ideas, we sought to investigate their relationship further. This year, we expanded the scope of data collection to assess the extent of SRE adoption across the industry, and to learn how such modern operational practices interact with DORAâs model of software delivery performance.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarting from the \u003ca href=\"http://sre.google/books\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epublished literature on SRE\u003c/a\u003e, we added the key elements of the framework as items in our survey of practitioners. We took care to avoid as much as possible any jargon, instead preferring plain language to describe how modern operations teams go about their work. Respondents reported on such practices as: defining reliability in terms of user-visible behavior; the use of automation to allow engineers to focus on strategic work; and having well-defined, well-practiced protocols for incident response.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlong the way, we found that using SRE to implement DevOps is much more widely practiced than we thought. SRE, and related disciplines like Facebookâs Production Engineering, have a reputation for being niche disciplines, practiced only by a handful of tech giants. To the contrary, we found that SRE is used in some capacity by a majority of the teams in the DORA survey, with 52% of respondents reporting the use of one or more SRE practices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSRE is a force multiplier for software delivery excellence\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-module h-c-page\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"article-image--wrap-medium \"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"SRE 1.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/SRE_1.1203064715921295.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rich-text\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnalyzing the results, we found compelling evidence that SRE is an effective approach to modern operations across the spectrum of organizations. In addition to driving better business outcomes, SRE helps focus effortsâteams that achieve their reliability goals report that they are able to spend more time coding, as theyâre less consumed by reacting to incidents. These findings are consistent with the observation that \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/resources/roi-of-devops-transformation-whitepaper\"\u003ehaving reliable services can directly impact revenue\u003c/a\u003e, as well as offering engineers greater flexibility to use their time to improve their systems, rather than simply repairing them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut while SRE is widely used and has demonstrable benefits, few respondents indicated that their teams have fully implemented every SRE technique we examined. Increased application of SRE has benefits at all levels: within every cluster of software delivery performance, teams that also meet their reliability goals outperform other members of their cluster in regard to business outcomes.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOn the SRE road to DevOps excellence\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSRE is more than a toolset; itâs also a cultural mindset about the role of operations staff. SRE is a learning discipline, aimed at understanding information and continuously iterating in response. Accordingly, adopting SRE takes time, and success requires starting small, and applying an iterative approach to SRE itself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are some ways to get started:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eFind free books and articles at \u003ca href=\"http://sre.google\"\u003esre.google\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eJoin a conversation with fellow practitioners, at all different stages of SRE implementation, at \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/reliability-discuss\"\u003ebit.ly/reliability-discuss\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eSpeak to your GCP account manager about our professional service offeringsÂ \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eApply to the \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/awards/devops/?eligible_for_cloud_free_trial=true\"\u003eDevOps awards\u003c/a\u003e to show how your organization is implementing award winning SRE practices along with the DORA principles!\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e",

We chose Google because they understand the industry we are in as they also manage travel products such as Google Travel. Google also created \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://cloud.google.com/sre\u0026#34;\u0026gt;SRE (Site Reliability Engineering)\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, and operates with SRE principles at the Google scale, which is what intrigued us the most.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Initially we started with a multi-cloud model, but that didn\u0026amp;#8217;t help us move faster so we consolidated to just Google Cloud.

Find colleagues who are also passionate about shifting culture and adopting SRE\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Create a community within your organization who is dedicated to the SRE journey and motivated to make things happen. As we adopted SRE at Sabre I saw more and more people rallying and coming together to support the culture change. With some momentum built it was great to bring shared experiences to the team as we all spoke in the same language talking about SLOs, SLIs, and about how we measure things.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Some of the ways in which we built our community was by hosting monthly brown bag sessions. This is an informal gathering where teams come in and share their experiences and challenges, or teach on specific SRE topics such as SLOs or toil. We also created a \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-cloud-southlake/\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;public Google Developer Group (GDG)\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; and have hosted several Google SRE subject matter experts to speak on SRE principles and best practices.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;2. Get your mid level leadership stakeholders on board\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We know how important \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-success-starts-with-getting-leadership-on-board\u0026#34;\u0026gt;getting leadership buy in\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; is to creating a successful SRE movement within an organization. That top-level buy-in is highly important to get resources and drive transformation across the organization, but what is sometimes missed is making it a priority to get mid-level leadership on board as well. It\u0026amp;#8217;s difficult to enact change from the ground up starting with practitioners at the bottom, and it\u0026amp;#8217;s also difficult to just have leadership buy in, as once it gets down to the middle, things may fall apart. It is imperative to have mid-level leaders on board as well, as they directly affect the culture and decisions of their teams. To avoid resistance, it is also important that the mid-level leadership (product, operations and engineering managers), i.e. people managers, will understand the motivations behind change so they will be onboard. Without that understanding, it will hinder mid-level leadership\u0026amp;#8217;s ability to communicate changes to the practitioners level and can impact the teams\u0026#39; goal and allocated bandwidth.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;3. Don\u0026amp;#8217;t be afraid to get help from professionals\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Adopting SRE at a large organization is no simple feat. Partnering with \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/pso_sre_google_cloud.pdf\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Google\u0026amp;#8217;s SRE consulting experts\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; has brought about a huge shift at Sabre. The value PSO brings is not just training, it\u0026#39;s also listening. We\u0026amp;#8217;ve had experienced Googlers who understand our problems and have been at our stage in the SRE journey listen, analyze and tailor the approach specific to our team\u0026#39;s goals. PSO helped us by shifting our engineering teams to be more customer centric, and aligning our product, operations, and development teams. But most importantly, they\u0026amp;#8217;ve helped to make our current teams happier, because they\u0026#39;re not spinning their wheels, waiting around on blocked requests.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When we partnered with PSO we were aware of who the key stakeholders in our organization are: the mid-level leadership and people managers. We made sure to bring them into our PSO discussions and decision making sessions and as a result, helped us to get more traction and solve the gap we had, enabling the middle-level and bringing them on board.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Some of the actions we have taken with help from our PSO SRE partners include adding a \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/how-sre-teams-are-organized-and-how-to-get-started\u0026#34;\u0026gt;tiers of service\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; approach, improving incident management through \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/shrinking-the-time-to-mitigate-production-incidents\u0026#34;\u0026gt;wheels of misfortune (WoM)\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, defining \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/practical-guide-to-setting-slos\u0026#34;\u0026gt;critical user journeys (CUJs)\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, and implementing \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/sre-error-budgets-and-maintenance-windows\u0026#34;\u0026gt;error budgets\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Since putting these SRE practices into place, our business is more aligned to customer experience. We now invest org resources according to the needs of our customers and with that have reduced silos across our teams. Our Ops team is much happier since they can move faster and not have to block requests. SRE has taught us a common language, a common framework.

First, developing on Google Cloud needs to be open\u0026amp;#8212;we rely heavily on open-source technologies so that it\u0026#39;s easier to move apps between environments, recruit skilled developers, and access the latest innovations sooner. Second, developing for Google Cloud should also be easy\u0026amp;#8212;we strive to offer intuitive, integrated tools that run well wherever you build your code, while minimizing your operational overhead. Finally, running on Google Cloud should be transformative\u0026amp;#8212;we offer services that help unleash your imagination, along with best practices and professional services to help you bring your ideas to life.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Today, at \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.withgoogle.com/next\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Google Cloud Next \u0026amp;#8216;21\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, we announced a variety of new tools and capabilities to deliver on those principles.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Opening Anthos to virtual machines\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Since announcing Anthos, our open-source-based platform for hybrid and mutlicloud deployments in 2018, we have continued to receive strong reception from customers and partners. In fact, in Q2 2021, Anthos compute under management grew more than 500% year-over-year. Anthos unifies the management of infrastructure and applications across on-premises, edge, and multiple public clouds, as well as ensuring consistent operation at scale. Based on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Anthos was originally designed to run applications in containers. To help you make that transition, we automated the process to migrate and modernize existing apps using \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/migrate/anthos\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Migrate for Anthos and GKE\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; from various virtual machine environments to containers.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;While we have seen many customers make the leap to containerization, some are not quite ready to move completely off of virtual machines (VMs). They want a unified development platform where developers can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in both containers and VMs in a common, shared environment. Today, we are announcing \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://cloud.google.com/anthos\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Anthos for Virtual Machines\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; in preview, allowing you to standardize on Kubernetes while continuing to run some workloads that cannot be easily containerized in virtual machines. Anthos for VMs will help platform developers standardize on an operation model, process and tooling; enable incremental modernization efforts; and support traditional workloads like Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) or stateful monolithic workloads.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You can take advantage of Anthos for VMs in two ways \u0026amp;#8211; either by attaching your vSphere VMs, or shifting your VMs as-is. For customers with active VMware environments, the Anthos control plane can now connect to your vSphere environment and attach your vSphere VMs, allowing you to apply consistent security and policies across clusters, gain visibility into the health and performance of your services, and manage traffic for both VMs and containers. Alternately, Anthos for VMs allows you to shift VMs as-is onto Anthos with \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://kubevirt.io/\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;KubeVirt\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, an open-source virtualization API for Kubernetes. Now you can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in both application containers as well as VMs on a common, shared Anthos environment. This is a great option for organizations that prefer to use open-source virtualization, as those same organizations often prefer to run \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal/1.6/concepts/about-bare-metal\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Anthos on bare metal\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. To help get started, we provide you with a \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos\u0026#34;\u0026gt;fit assessment tool\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; to identify which approach to take.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Taking your Anthos experience further\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;We\u0026amp;#8217;re also making it easier for you to manage containerized workloads already running in other clouds through Anthos. While you can already run containers in AWS and Azure from Anthos, we\u0026amp;#8217;re taking this a step further with the new \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/multi-cloud\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Anthos Multi-Cloud API\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. Generally available in Q4 \u0026amp;#8216;21, this new API lets you provision and manage GKE clusters running on AWS or Azure infrastructure directly from the command line interface or the Google Cloud Console, all while being managed by a central control plane. This gives you a single API to manage all your container deployments regardless of which major public cloud you\u0026#39;re using, thus minimizing the time you spend jumping between user interfaces to accomplish day-to-day management tasks like creating, managing, and updating clusters.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Over the past year, we\u0026amp;#8217;ve brought some of the innovations originally developed for hybrid and multicloud use cases in Anthos back to GKE running in Google Cloud. Specifically, \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/config-management\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Anthos Config Management\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/anthos/service-mesh\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Anthos Service Mesh\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; are now generally available for GKE as standalone services with pay-as-you-go pricing. GKE customers can now use Anthos Config Management to take advantage of config and policy automation at a low incremental per-cluster cost, and use Anthos Service Mesh to enable next-level security and networking on container-based microservices.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Last but not least, we are excited to announce that starting today, Anthos Service Mesh is generally available to support a hybrid mesh. This gives you the flexibility to have a common mesh that spans both your Google Cloud and on-prem deployments.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Customers like \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;http://www.westerndigital.com\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Western Digital\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; have already experienced many benefits from adopting Anthos as their application modernization platform:\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;i\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#34;As a global storage leader with sophisticated manufacturing facilities around the world, Western Digital sees cloud technology as an enabler of our key business priorities: reducing time to deliver products and services, rationalizing our entire application footprint, and meeting customer demand for IoT and edge applications,\u0026amp;#8221;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt; said Jahidul Khandaker, senior vice president and CIO, Western Digital. \u0026lt;i\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#8220;Anthos is our unified management platform of choice\u0026amp;#8212;it gives us insights across our Google Cloud and on-premises environments, while keeping the doors open for a multi-cloud future. Anthos has delivered several advantages for our developers: a richer user experience, greater security, and enhanced flexibility to manage factory applications\u0026amp;#8212;no matter where they reside\u0026amp;#8212;on-prem, in the cloud or a mix of both.\u0026amp;#34;\u0026lt;/i\u0026gt;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Easy does it\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;In addition to being an open platform, we strive to make Google Cloud easy to use for operators as well as developers. For example, earlier this year\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-gke-autopilot\u0026#34;\u0026gt;we introduced GKE Autopilot\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, a mode of operations in GKE that empowers you to simplify operations by offloading the management of infrastructure, control plane, and nodes. With GKE Autopilot, customers like\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/customers/ubie\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Ubie\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, a Japanese-based healthcare technology company, have eliminated the need to configure and maintain infrastructure, which helped their development teams focus on making healthcare more accessible.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;With Cloud Run, our serverless compute platform, you can abstract away infrastructure management entirely. This year, our focus has been on bringing the simplicity of Cloud Run to more workloads, like traditional applications written in Java Spring Boot, ASP.NET, and Django, among others. Along with a new second generation execution environment for enhanced network and CPU performance, we\u0026amp;#8217;ve added\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/introducing-committed-use-discounts-for-cloud-run\u0026#34;\u0026gt;committed-use discounts\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#160;and introduced\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/cloud-run-gets-always-on-cpu-allocation\u0026#34;\u0026gt;new CPU allocation controls and price\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, allowing you to save up to 17% and 25%, respectively, on your compute bill.

It comes with your favorite developer tools (e.g., docker, minikube, skaffold, and many more) preinstalled, and this year, we added ~100 live tutorials to it\u0026amp;#8212;no more switching between the documentation, the terminal, and your code!\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Once that code is ready, you want building it and deploying it to be as seamless as possible. Today we are announcing\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/build/docs/hybrid/overview\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Cloud Build Hybrid\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, which lets you build, test, and deploy across clouds and on-prem systems, so developers get consistent CI/CD tooling across their environments, and platform engineers don\u0026#39;t have to worry about maintaining and scaling their systems. Cloud Build is also integrated with\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z4vYdjF66UTOJgIpaDlDnXOuDCV6YulMhvNDjgoFiYo/edit?resourcekey=0-Vxxrly14dbfaBHg21HnOfg#\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Artifact Registry\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, which now allows you to store not only in containers, but also language-specific artifacts in one place. Finally, with the recently launched\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/deploy/docs/overview\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Google Cloud Deploy\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, which is a managed, continuous delivery service initially for GKE, we\u0026amp;#8217;re making it easy to scale your pipelines across your organization.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Easy for operators\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;When your applications are up and running, you need to observe and analyze them for better operations and business insights.

Now you can build, modify, and deploy applications residing in both application containers as well as VMs on a common, shared Anthos environment. This is a great option for organizations that prefer to use open-source virtualization, as those same organizations often prefer to run \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/bare-metal/1.6/concepts/about-bare-metal\"\u003eAnthos on bare metal\u003c/a\u003e. To help get started, we provide you with a \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/anthos\"\u003efit assessment tool\u003c/a\u003e to identify which approach to take.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eTaking your Anthos experience further\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWeâre also making it easier for you to manage containerized workloads already running in other clouds through Anthos. While you can already run containers in AWS and Azure from Anthos, weâre taking this a step further with the new \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/anthos/clusters/docs/multi-cloud\"\u003eAnthos Multi-Cloud API\u003c/a\u003e. Generally available in Q4 â21, this new API lets you provision and manage GKE clusters running on AWS or Azure infrastructure directly from the command line interface or the Google Cloud Console, all while being managed by a central control plane. This gives you a single API to manage all your container deployments regardless of which major public cloud you're using, thus minimizing the time you spend jumping between user interfaces to accomplish day-to-day management tasks like creating, managing, and updating clusters.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOver the past year, weâve brought some of the innovations originally developed for hybrid and multicloud use cases in Anthos back to GKE running in Google Cloud. Specifically, \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/anthos/config-management\"\u003eAnthos Config Management\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/anthos/service-mesh\"\u003eAnthos Service Mesh\u003c/a\u003e are now generally available for GKE as standalone services with pay-as-you-go pricing. GKE customers can now use Anthos Config Management to take advantage of config and policy automation at a low incremental per-cluster cost, and use Anthos Service Mesh to enable next-level security and networking on container-based microservices.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLast but not least, we are excited to announce that starting today, Anthos Service Mesh is generally available to support a hybrid mesh. This gives you the flexibility to have a common mesh that spans both your Google Cloud and on-prem deployments.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCustomers like \u003ca href=\"http://www.westerndigital.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWestern Digital\u003c/a\u003e have already experienced many benefits from adopting Anthos as their application modernization platform:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\"As a global storage leader with sophisticated manufacturing facilities around the world, Western Digital sees cloud technology as an enabler of our key business priorities: reducing time to deliver products and services, rationalizing our entire application footprint, and meeting customer demand for IoT and edge applications,â\u003c/i\u003e said Jahidul Khandaker, senior vice president and CIO, Western Digital. \u003ci\u003eâAnthos is our unified management platform of choiceâit gives us insights across our Google Cloud and on-premises environments, while keeping the doors open for a multi-cloud future.

For example, earlier this yearÂ \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/introducing-gke-autopilot\"\u003ewe introduced GKE Autopilot\u003c/a\u003e, a mode of operations in GKE that empowers you to simplify operations by offloading the management of infrastructure, control plane, and nodes. With GKE Autopilot, customers likeÂ \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/customers/ubie\"\u003eUbie\u003c/a\u003e, a Japanese-based healthcare technology company, have eliminated the need to configure and maintain infrastructure, which helped their development teams focus on making healthcare more accessible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith Cloud Run, our serverless compute platform, you can abstract away infrastructure management entirely. This year, our focus has been on bringing the simplicity of Cloud Run to more workloads, like traditional applications written in Java Spring Boot, ASP.NET, and Django, among others.

Today, we hear from some Google SREsâVartika Agarwal, Senior Technical Program Manager, Development; Tracy Ferrell, Senior SRE Manager; Mahesh Palekar, Director SRE; and Magi Agrama, Senior Technical Program Manager, SREâabout how to evaluate your teamâs current reliability mindset, and what you want it to be.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr/\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving a reliable software product can improve usersâ trust in your organization, the effectiveness of your development processes, and the quality of your products overall. More than ever, product reliability is front and center, as outages negatively impact customers and their businesses. But in an effort to develop new features, many organizations limit their reliability efforts to what happens after an outage, and tactically solve for the immediate problems that sparked it. They often fail to realize that they can move quickly while still improving their productâs reliability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Google, weâve given a lot of thought to product reliabilityâand several of its aspects are well understood, for example product or system design. What people think about less is the culture and the mindset of the organization that creates a reliable product in the first place. We believe that the reliability of a product is a property of the architecture of its system, processes, culture, as well as the mindset of the product team or organization that built it. In other words, reliability should be woven into the fabric of an organization, not just the result of a strong design ethos.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this blog post, we discuss the lessons weâve learned relevant to organizational or product leads who have the ability to influence the culture of the entire product team, from (but not limited to) engineering, product management, marketing, reliability engineering, and support organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eGoals\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eReliability should be woven into the fabric of how an organization executes. At Google, weâve developed a terminology to categorize and describe your organizationâs reliability mindset, to help you understand how intentional your organization is in this respect. Our ultimate goal is to help you improve and adopt product reliability practices that will permeate the ethos of the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBy identifying these reliability phases, we do not mean to offer a prescriptive list of things to do that will improve your productâs reliability. Nor should they be read as a set of mandated principles that everyone should apply, or be used to publicly label a team, spurring competition between teams. Rather, leaders should consider these phases as a way to help them develop their teamâs culture, on the road to sustainably building reliable products.Â Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe organizational reliability continuum\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eBased on our observations here at Google, there are five basic stages of organizational reliability, and they are based on the classic organizational model of absent, reactive, proactive, strategic and visionary.

There is a significant cost associated with moving from one phase to another and a cost to remain very high on this curve. In our experience, being proactive is a healthy level to target and is ideal for most products.Â \u003c/i\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003ci\u003eTo illustrate this point, here is a simple graph of where various Google product teams are on the organizational reliability spectrum; as you can see, it produces a standard bell-curve distribution. While many Googleâs product teams have a reactive or proactive reliability culture, most can be described as proactive. You, as an organizational leader, must consciously decide to be at a level based on the product requirements and client expectations.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-image_full_width\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-module h-c-page\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h-c-grid\"\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Googles_Reliability_culture.max-2800x2800.jpg\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Googleâs Reliability culture.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Googles_Reliability_culture.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-paragraph\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rich-text\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eFurther, itâs common to have attributes across several phases, for example, an organization may be largely reactive with a few proactive attributes. Team culture will wax and wane between phases, as it takes effort to maintain a strategic reliability culture. However, as more of the organization embraces and celebrates reliability as a key feature, the cost of maintenance decreases.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe key to success is making an honest assessment of what phase youâre in, and then doing concerted work to move to the phase that makes sense for your product. If your organization is in the absent or reactive phase, remember that many products in nascent stages of their life cycle may be comfortable there (in both the startup and long term maintenance of a stable product).\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eReliability phases in action\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo illustrate the reliability phases in practice, it is interesting to look at examples of organizations and how they have progressed or regressed through them.Â Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt should be noted that all companies and teams are different and the progress through these phases can take varying amounts of time. It is not uncommon to take two to three years to move into a truly proactive state. In a proactive state all parts of the organization contribute to reliability without worrying that it will negatively impact feature velocity. Staying in the proactive phase also takes time and effort.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eNobody can be a hero forever\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne infrastructure services team started small with a few well understood APIs. One key member of the team, a product architect, understood the system well and ensured that things ran smoothly by ensuring design decisions were sound and being at each major incident to rapidly mitigate the issue. This was the one person who understood the entire system and was able to predict what can and cannot impact its stability. But when they left the team, the system complexity grew by leaps and bounds. Suddenly there were many critical user-facing and internal outages.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOrganizational leaders initiated both short and long-term reliability programs to restore stability. They focused on reducing the blast radius and the impact of global outages. Leadership recognized that to sustain this trajectory, they recognized that they had to go beyond engineering solutions and implement cultural changes such as recognizing reliability as their number-one feature. This led to broad training around reliability best practices, incorporating reliability in architectural/design reviews and recognizing and rewarding reliability beyond hero moments.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a result, the organization evolved from a reactive to a strategic reliability mindset, aided by setting reliability as their number-one feature, recognizing and rewarding long-term reliability improvements, and adopting the systemic belief that reliability is everyoneâs responsibilityânot just that of a few heroes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-image_full_width\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-module h-c-page\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h-c-grid\"\u003e\u003cfigure class=\"article-image--large h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-3 \"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Googles_Reliability_culture_4.max-2800x2800.jpg\" rel=\"external\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Googleâs Reliability culture 4.jpg\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Googles_Reliability_culture_4.max-1000x1000.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-paragraph\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rich-text\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003eIf you think you are done, think again\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnd users are highly dependent on the reliability of this product and it ties directly to user trust.

From cloud-native to more traditional businesses, three themes consistently emerged: cost of ownership, security and audit, and integration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLetâs take a deeper look at these challenges and how we address them with Google Cloud Deploy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eCost of ownership\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTime and again we heard that the operational cost of Kubernetes continuous delivery is high. Identifying best and repeatable practices, scaling delivery tooling and pipelines, and staying currentâto say nothing of maintenanceâis resource-intensive and takes time away from the core business.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eâWe canât afford to be innovating in continuous delivery,â one customer told us. âWe want an opinionated product that supports best practices out of the box.â\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGoogle Cloud Deploy addresses cost of ownership head-on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a managed service, Google Cloud Deploy eliminates the scaling and maintenance responsibilities that typically come with self-managed continuous delivery solutions.

Not all users and decisions carry the same authority, however. Being able to define a delivery pipeline and make updates doesnât always mean you can create releases, for example, nor does being able to promote a release to staging mean you can approve it to production.

Loweâs went from one release every two weeks to 20+ releases daily, helping meet its customer needs faster and more effectively. Today, the Loweâs SRE team shares how they used SRE principles to decrease their mean-time-to-recovery (MTTR) by over 80 percent.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe stakes of managing Lowes.com have never been higher, and that means spotting, troubleshooting and recovering from incidents as quickly as possible, so that customers can continue to do business on our site.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo do that, itâs crucial to have solid incident engineering practices in place. Resolving an incident means mitigating the impact and/or restoring the service to its previous condition. The average time it takes to do this is called mean time to recovery (MTTR). Tracking this metric helps us stay on top of the overall reliability of our systems at Loweâs, while simultaneously improving the speed with which we recover. Our goal is to keep the MTTR metric as low as possible, so that failures donât negatively impact our business. Here are the four areas we addressed to drive holistic improvement in our MTTR.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eLoweâs incident reporting process\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo reduce MTTR, we created a seamless incident reporting process following SRE principles. Our incident reporting process is a workflow that starts at the time an incident occurs, and ends with an SRE captain who closes the action items after a postmortem report. With this approach, we are able to limit the number of critical incidents. The reporting process involves three core components: monitoring, alerting, and blameless postmortems.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMonitoring and alerting\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving proper monitoring and alerting in place is crucial when it comes to incident management. Monitoring and alerting tools let you detect issues as soon as they occur, and notify the right person in the shortest possible time to take action. From a measurement standpoint, we track this as our mean time to acknowledge (MTTA). This is the average time it takes from when an alert is triggered, to when work on the issue begins.\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt the time of an incident, our \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/monitoring\"\u003emonitoring and alerting tools\u003c/a\u003e notify the on-call SRE first responder via \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/support/notification-options\"\u003ePagerDuty\u003c/a\u003e in the form of a phone call, text message and email.

The on-call SRE then initiates a triage call with our service/domain stakeholders to resolve the incident. As a result, we reduced our MTTA from 30 minutes in 2019, to one minute â a 97 percent decrease.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eBlameless postmortems: learning from incidents\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA postmortem is a written record of an incident, its impact, the actions taken to resolve it, the root cause and the follow-up actions to prevent the incident from recurring (\u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/example-postmortem/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esee example here\u003c/a\u003e). A blameless postmortem builds on that and is a core part of an SRE culture, and our culture at Loweâs. We ensure that individuals are not singled out, and the outcome for all postmortems are directed toward learnings and process improvement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor us, the postmortem process is the biggest part of our incident workflow. When an SRE creates a new postmortem report, the first step is to conduct a \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/getting-the-most-out-of-shared-postmortems-cre-life-lessons\"\u003epostmortem session\u003c/a\u003e with domain stakeholders to review the report. The postmortem then goes into the review stage and gets reviewed by more stakeholders in our weekly postmortem meeting. In the final stage of this process, the SRE captain will close the report once everyone in the weekly meeting agrees that the report is complete.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo conduct a successful postmortem, it is critical to keep the focus on identifying gaps and issues with the system and operations processes, rather than an individual, and generate concrete actions to address the problems weâve identified. To ensure this, we follow a couple of best practices:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eWe start by gathering the facts from the person who identified the problem, and each SLI owner has to identify a gap or the next SLI upstream owner who created the impact for them.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEvery SLI owner is provided full opportunity to present their case, and identifying the issue is done as a community exercise.Â \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOnce action items and process changes are identified, an owner is nominated to complete the actions, or they will volunteer.Â \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFor easy reference, we publish and store postmortems in our incident knowledge base. This process helps SREs continuously improve as future incidents arise.Â \u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eContinuous ImprovementÂ \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEncouraging a culture of honest, transparent and direct feedback that you need for blameless postmortems is often an iterative process that needs sponsorship from executives, empowering incident captains to lead the entirety of the discussion and outcomes. Running successful postmortems, and completing action items from them, needs to be recognized and accounted for in SRE performance objective assessment. As shared in \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGoogleâs SRE book\u003c/a\u003e, the best practice is to ensure that writing effective postmortems is a rewarded and celebrated practice, with leadershipâs acknowledgement and participation. This is possibly the hardest part to accomplish in an effective postmortem during a cultural transformation unless you have full buy-in from leadership.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, itâs all well worth it. This process is a key part of how we were able to improve our MTTR over timeâfrom two hours in 2019 to just 17 minutes!Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOur SRE incident reporting process has also transformed how our company solves issues. By streamlining this workflow from alerting, to solving an issue, to blameless postmortems, we have reduced our MTTR by 82 percent and our MTTA by 97 percent. Most importantly, our team is learning from every incident and becoming better engineers as a result.

Thatâs why we created \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry\"\u003eArtifact Registry\u003c/a\u003e, a fully-managed service with support for both container images and non-container artifacts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eArtifact Registry improves and extends upon the existing capabilities of \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/container-registry\"\u003eContainer Registry\u003c/a\u003e, such as customer-managed encryption keys, VPC-SC support, Pub/Sub notifications, and more, providing a foundation for major upgrades in security, scalability and control. While Container Registry is still available and will continue to be supported as a \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/inside-google-cloud/new-api-stability-tenets-govern-google-enterprise-apis\"\u003eGoogle Enterprise API\u003c/a\u003e, going forward new features will only be available in Artifact Registry, and Container Registry will only receive critical security fixes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBelow, weâll highlight the key improvements Artifact Registry provides over Container Registry, as well as the steps to start using it today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA unified control plane for container, OS and language repositories\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eArtifact Registry includes more than just container images: as a developer, you can store multiple artifact formats, including OS packages for Debian and RPM, as well as language packages for popular languages like Python, Java, and Node. In addition, you can manage them all from a single, unified interface.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA more granular permission model with Cloud IAM\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eArtifact Registry comes with fine-grained access control via \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/iam\"\u003eCloud IAM\u003c/a\u003e. Unlike Container Registry, this allows you to control access on a per-repository basis, rather than all images stored in a project. This enables you to scope permissions as granularly as possible, for example to specific regions or environments as necessary.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eRepositories in the region of your choice\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eArtifact Registry supports the creation of regional repositories, which allows you to put your artifacts and data directly in the location that they'll be used, allowing for higher availability and speed. In Container Registry, youâre limited to âmulti-regionsâ: for example, the closest multi-region for Australia is Asia. However, with Artifact Registryâs regional support, you can create a repository directly in the Sydney data center.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eA pricing model that respects your region\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile Artifact Registryâs pricing is still based on a combination of network egress and storage usage, support for regional repositories means that you can choose in what region to host your container repositories. Although per unit storage costs are higher for Artifact Registry, optimizing the locations of your repositories to be hosted in the same region where they are used can result in cost savings, because any network traffic within the same region is not considered egress and is thus free.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePart of a secure supply chain\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eArtifact Registry was designed from the ground up to integrate into our suite of secure supply chain products.

Platform administrators have been hand-crafting and partially automating configuration with new infrastructure-as-code languages and tools for years.

Policies act as guardrails to prevent any changes to configuration from violating your custom security, operational, or compliance controls. For example, you can set policies to actively block any non-compliant API requests, require every namespace to have a label, prevent pods from running privileged containers, restrict the types of storage volumes a container can mount, and more.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePolicy Controller is based on the open source \u003ca href=\"https://open-policy-agent.github.io/gatekeeper/website/docs/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOpen Policy Agent Gatekeeper\u003c/a\u003e project, augmented by Google Cloud with a ready-to-use \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/anthos-config-management/docs/reference/constraint-template-library\"\u003elibrary of pre-built policies\u003c/a\u003e for the most common security and compliance controls.

Additionally, ensuring you make the right policy decisions in an area as high-stakes and ever-evolving as security means that youâll likely spend hours researching and reading through documentation, perhaps even hiring experts.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/delivering-the-industrys-most-trusted-cloud\"\u003epartner with you\u003c/a\u003e and help address these challenges, Google Cloud built the security foundations blueprint to identify core security decisions and guide you with opinionated best practices for deploying a secured GCP environment.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat is the security foundations blueprint?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe security foundations blueprint is made up of two resources: the \u003ca href=\"https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/google-cloud-security-foundations-guide.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esecurity foundations guide\u003c/a\u003e, and the \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/terraform-google-modules/terraform-example-foundation\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTerraform automation repository\u003c/a\u003e. For each security decision, the security foundations guide provides opinionated best practices in order to help you build a secure starting point for your Google Cloud deployment, and can be read and used as a reference guide.

It is almost impossible to establish a data-driven feedback loop without a well-defined and measured reliability goal. For those goals to be meaningful, SREs must have the capability to defend them.

They are the de-facto regulators of the reliability feedback loop and maintain the policy documents that underpin it. Their connection to many teams and services gives them broader insights that can spark cross-functional reliability improvements.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Principle #3: SREs engage early and comprehensively\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As we said earlier, \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;SREs should be empowered to make tomorrow better than today.\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; Without the ability to change the code and configuration of the services they support, they cannot fix problems as they encounter them.

Their breadth of engagements across many teams makes them naturally suited for providing high-level architectural advice to improve reliability across an entire organization.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Principle #4: SREs automate anything repetitive\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Finally, SREs believe that computers are fundamentally better suited to doing repetitive work than humans are.

Instead, we hope to help answer this question by discussing some principles we consider fundamental to how an SRE team operates. We'll examine why they're important and suggest questions that characterize a team's progress towards embodying them.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAre we there yet?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis question is asked in different ways, for a myriad of different reasons, and it can be quite hard to answer due to the wide range of \u003ca href=\"https://web.devopstopologies.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edifferent circumstances\u003c/a\u003e that our customers operate in.

Job roles and teams crystallize from a more fluid set of responsibilities as organizations grow larger. But as this process plays out, the people involved may feel less certain of the scope of their responsibilities, precipitating the âare we there yet?â question. We suspect that's where the tone of existential dread comes from...\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eKey SRE indicators\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWithin the CRE team here at Google Cloud, the âare we there yet?â question surfaced a wide variety of opinions about the core principles that should guide an SRE team. We did manage to reach a rough consensus, with one provisoâthe answer is partially dependent on how a team engages with the services it supports.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe've chosen to structure this post around a set of principles that we would broadly expect groups of people working as SREs that \u003ci\u003edirectly support services in production\u003c/i\u003e to adhere to. As in a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litmus#Uses\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elitmus test\u003c/a\u003e, this won't provide pin-point accuracy; but in our collective opinion at least, alignment with most of the principles laid out below is a good signal that a team is practicing something that can recognizably be termed \u003ci\u003eSite Reliability Engineering.\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDirectly engaged SRE teams are usually considered \u003ci\u003eAccountable\u003c/i\u003e (in \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRACI terms\u003c/a\u003e) for the serviceâs reliability, with \u003ci\u003eResponsibility\u003c/i\u003e shared between the SRE and development teams. As a team provides less direct support these indicators may be less applicable. We hope those teams can still adapt the principles to their own circumstances.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo illustrate how you might do this, for each principle we've given a counter-example of a team of SREs operating in an advisory capacity. They're subject-matter experts who are \u003ci\u003eConsulted\u003c/i\u003e by development teams who are themselves \u003ci\u003eResponsible\u003c/i\u003e and \u003ci\u003eAccountable\u003c/i\u003e for service reliability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWherever your engagement model lies on the spectrum, being perceived by the rest of the organization as jointly responsible for a service's reliability, or as reliability subject-matter experts, is a key indicator of SRE-hood.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePrinciple #1: SREs mitigate present and \u003ci\u003efuture\u003c/i\u003e incidents\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis principle is the one that usually underlies the perception of \u003cb\u003eresponsibility and accountability\u003c/b\u003e for a service's reliability. All the careful engineering and active regulation in the world can't guarantee reliability, especially in complex distributed systemsâsometimes, things go wrong unexpectedly and the only thing left to do is react, mitigate, and fix. SREs have both the authority and the technical capability to act fast to restore service in these situations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut mitigating the immediate problem isn't enough. If it can happen again tomorrow, then tomorrow isn't better than today, so SREs should work to understand the precipitating factors of incidents and propose changes that remediate the entire class of problem in the infrastructure they are responsible for.

Ask yourself these questions, which go from fine detail to a broad, high-level scope:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you engineer your service \u003cb\u003enow\u003c/b\u003e to improve its reliability, e.g. by viewing and modifying the source code and/or configuration?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre you involved in analysis and design of \u003cb\u003efuture\u003c/b\u003e iterations of your service, providing a lens on reliability/operability/maintainability?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eCan you influence your \u003cb\u003eorganizationâs\u003c/b\u003e wider architectural decision making?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eAdvising other teams naturally shifts priorities away from directly modifying the configuration or code of individual services. But consultant SREs may still maintain frameworks or shared libraries providing core reliability features, like exporting common metrics or graceful service degradation. Their breadth of engagements across many teams makes them naturally suited for providing high-level architectural advice to improve reliability across an entire organization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePrinciple #4: SREs automate anything repetitive\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinally, SREs believe that computers are fundamentally better suited to doing repetitive work than humans are. People often underestimate the \u003ca href=\"https://xkcd.com/1205/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ereturns on investment\u003c/a\u003e when considering whether to automate a routine task, and that's before factoring in the exponential growth curve that comes with running a large, successful service. Moreover, computers never become inattentive and make mistakes when doing the same task for the hundredth time, or become demoralized and quit. Hiring or \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/resources/practices-and-processes/training-site-reliability-engineers/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etraining SREs\u003c/a\u003e is expensive and time-consuming, so a successful SRE organization depends heavily on making computers do the grunt work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAre you sufficiently automating your work? Ask yourself these questions:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you useâor createâautomation and other tools to ensure that operational load won't scale linearly with organic growth or the number of services you support?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eDo you try to measure repetitive work on your team, and reduce it over time?\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003ch2\u003eA call for reflection\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMost blog posts end with a call for action. We'd rather you took time to reflect, instead of jumping up to make changes straight after reading. \u003cb\u003eThere's a risk, when writing an opinionated piece like this, that the lines drawn in the sand are used to divide, not to grow and improve.\u003c/b\u003e We promise this isn't a deliberate effort to gatekeep SRE and exclude those who don't tick the boxes; we see no value in that. But in some ways gatekeeping is what job roles are \u003ci\u003edesigned\u003c/i\u003e to do, because specialization and the division of labour is critical to the success of any organization, and this makes it hard to avoid drawing those lines.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor those who aspire to call themselves SREs, or are concerned that others may disagree with their characterization of themselves as SREs, perhaps these opinions can assuage some of that existential dread.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e",

To modernize our systems and build new capabilities for our customers and associates, we leverage Google\u0026amp;#8217;s SRE framework and Google Cloud, which helps us meet their needs faster and more effectively. With these efforts, we\u0026amp;#8217;ve been able to go from one release every two weeks to 20+ releases daily\u0026amp;#8212;a 300x increase.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Our SRE transformation didn\u0026amp;#8217;t happen overnight, though. Every step along the way brought some challenges. But looking back, we are excited to see how much we have accomplished for our customers as a result.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Back in 2018, before adopting SRE practices, we were more reactive than proactive, following an \u0026amp;#8220;eyes on glass\u0026amp;#8221; approach. On-call structures and incident management efficiency were not at optimal levels with too many repetitive and manual tasks, resulting in operational toil. Production concerns were not surfaced into the product roadmap, which resulted in delays in making fixes.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;Bootstrapping SRE at Lowe\u0026amp;#8217;s\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;As we moved from on-prem to \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Google Cloud\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, we decided to move from a monolithic- to microservices-based architecture. And to better manage this new architecture, we embarked on an SRE journey.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Then as COVID-19 hit, we really had to accelerate this journey as customers increasingly moved to online ordering and delivery to meet their Total Home Improvement needs. To do so, we followed four key principles that allowed us to meet changing customer needs quickly and release fast and reliably.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Automate away toil\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;As we moved from traditional Ops to an SRE ecosystem, our biggest opportunity was \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;reducing toil\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;, so that engineers can spend time on activities that drive business impact and customer outcomes. We think of toil as work that is manual, repetitive,\u0026amp;#160; tactical, devoid of enduring value\u0026amp;#8212;but automatable. So, to tackle toil, we focused on automating away the need for manual intervention. As an example, we made sure engineers were not the first point of contact for any alert. Any triage or resolution that an engineer can perform, a machine can be trained to do the same. We used supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to automate our toil. With a long-term goal of \u0026amp;#8220;no toil,\u0026amp;#8221; our SREs work on identifying and reducing toil to a manageable level across the organization.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Engineer alignment through roadmaps\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;Our goal is to maximize the engineering velocity of developer teams while keeping products reliable. We want an engagement model where product, SRE and development teams are closely aligned. A key way we\u0026amp;#8217;ve been able to create this alignment is by having our SREs embedded into domain and product teams. Each domain has an SRE, who is\u0026amp;#160; involved at the beginning stages of product development to ensure that the domain stakeholders are in alignment with the SRE initiatives. As such, SREs are able to improve the reliability, performance, scalability and launch velocity of the services throughout all phases of the service lifecycle.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Adopt one-touch releases\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;Our path to production used to contain many manual steps and validations, slowing the rate at which we released features. Additionally, we used to bulk all our releases together to deploy at once, which increased the risk of failure and created a longer feedback loop from production. To tackle this with an SRE mindset, we created a one-touch release process in which SREs review the product team\u0026amp;#8217;s pull requests. When approved, this triggers a DevSecOps pipeline that deploys the approved changes to production securely. This process created a safe, reliable and sustainable continuous delivery pipeline with quick feedback loops. Striking the right balance between speed, innovation and stability, we were able to increase our releases exponentially for the year, taking less than 30 minutes per release to deliver quality code, including various automated quality checks and processes, all in just one click.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;b\u0026gt;Embrace capacity planning\u0026lt;br\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt;To ensure our services have enough spare capacity to handle any surge in traffic patterns, our SREs emphasize capacity planning, making recommended capacity changes in the continuous delivery (CD) pipeline. They constantly \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/monitoring\u0026#34;\u0026gt;monitor performance\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; to make sure the service is robust, stable and available. And when there\u0026amp;#8217;s a sudden surge beyond the forecasted volume, SREs change the capacity on demand and document changes for the performance and domain teams.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Capacity planning is especially important for us during peak holiday times such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday (BFCM). We lay out our SRE stability plan three months in advance and surface into the domain team\u0026amp;#8217;s product roadmap. This way development teams are able to allocate sufficient engineering time to reliability. We do performance testing to ensure the environment is able to sustain increased load over long periods of time and also handle sudden surges in traffic. We also do region failover testing at a global scale to validate the automatic failover duration of service level agreements\u0026amp;#160; (SLAs), SRE and domain readiness. Additionally, we conduct Black Friday and Cyber Monday-specific destructive testing to validate customer experience, reliability and more.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Google Cloud\u0026amp;#8217;s Black Friday and Cyber Monday \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/solutions/retail\u0026#34;\u0026gt;white-glove service\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; played a key role in ensuring our success in both BFCM 2019 and BFCM 2020.

We think of toil as work that is manual, repetitive,Â  tactical, devoid of enduring valueâbut automatable. So, to tackle toil, we focused on automating away the need for manual intervention. As an example, we made sure engineers were not the first point of contact for any alert. Any triage or resolution that an engineer can perform, a machine can be trained to do the same. We used supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to automate our toil.

We want an engagement model where product, SRE and development teams are closely aligned. A key way weâve been able to create this alignment is by having our SREs embedded into domain and product teams. Each domain has an SRE, who isÂ  involved at the beginning stages of product development to ensure that the domain stakeholders are in alignment with the SRE initiatives. As such, SREs are able to improve the reliability, performance, scalability and launch velocity of the services throughout all phases of the service lifecycle.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eAdopt one-touch releases\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003eOur path to production used to contain many manual steps and validations, slowing the rate at which we released features. Additionally, we used to bulk all our releases together to deploy at once, which increased the risk of failure and created a longer feedback loop from production. To tackle this with an SRE mindset, we created a one-touch release process in which SREs review the product teamâs pull requests. When approved, this triggers a DevSecOps pipeline that deploys the approved changes to production securely. This process created a safe, reliable and sustainable continuous delivery pipeline with quick feedback loops. Striking the right balance between speed, innovation and stability, we were able to increase our releases exponentially for the year, taking less than 30 minutes per release to deliver quality code, including various automated quality checks and processes, all in just one click.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eEmbrace capacity planning\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003eTo ensure our services have enough spare capacity to handle any surge in traffic patterns, our SREs emphasize capacity planning, making recommended capacity changes in the continuous delivery (CD) pipeline.

Then we use \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/kubernetes-development-simplified-skaffold-is-now-ga\"\u003eSkaffold\u003c/a\u003e to build containers locally, while Cloud Build helps with continuous integration (CI). The \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/marketplace/google-cloud-build\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCloud Build GitHub app\u003c/a\u003e allows us to automate builds and tests as part of our GitHub workflow. Cloud Build is differentiated from other continuous integration tools since it is fully serverless. It scales up and scales down in response to load, with no need for us to pre-provision servers or pay in advance for additional capacity. We pay for the exact resources we use.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce the image is built by Cloud Build, it is stored, managed, and secured in Googleâs \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/container-registry\"\u003eContainer Registry\u003c/a\u003e. Just like Cloud Build, Container Registry is serverless, so we only pay for what weÂ  use. Additionally, since Container Registry comes with automatic vulnerability scanning, every time we upload a new image to Container Registry, we can also scan it for vulnerabilities.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNext, a Tekton pipeline is triggered, which deploys the docker images stored in Container Registry and Kubernetes manifests to a running GKE cluster. Along with Cloud Build, Tekton is a critical part of our CI/CD process at ForgeRock. Most importantly, since Tekton comes with standardized Kubernetes-native primitives, we can create continuous delivery workflows very quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAfter deployment, Tekton triggers a functional test suite to ensure that the applications we deploy perform as expected. The test results are posted to our team Slack channel so all developers have instant access and insights about each cluster. From there, we are able to provide our customers with their finished product request.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e3.Â  Leverage multicloud patterns and practices\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe industry has seen a shift towards \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/multicloud\"\u003emulticloud\u003c/a\u003e. Organizations have adopted multicloud strategies to minimize vendor lock-in, take advantage of best-in-class solutions, improve cost-efficiencies, and increase flexibility through choice.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt ForgeRock, weâre big proponents of multicloud. Part of that comes from the fact that our identity and access management product works across Google Cloud, AWS, and Azure. Developing products using open-source technologies such as Kubernetes has been particularly helpful in driving this interoperability.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTekton has been another critical project that has allowed us to prevent vendor lock-in. Thanks to Tekton, our continuous delivery pipelines can deploy across any Kubernetes cluster. Most importantly, since Tekton pipelines run on Kubernetes, these pipelines can be decoupled from the runtime. Like Tekton and Kubernetes, both Cloud Build and Container Registry are based on open technologies. \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCommunity-contributed builders\u003c/a\u003eand \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eofficial builder images\u003c/a\u003e allow us to connect to a variety of tools as a part of the build process. And finally, with support for open technologies like \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/google-cloud-now-supports-buildpacks\"\u003eGoogle Cloud buildpacks\u003c/a\u003e within Cloud Build, we can build containers without even knowing Docker.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMaking it easier for developers and operators to build, deploy and manage applications is critical for the success of any organization. Driving developer productivity within IDEs, leveraging end-to-end automation, and support for multi-cloud patterns and practices are just some of the ways we are trying to achieve this at ForgeRock.

So, letâs assume that youâve gone ahead and done that. Now what? What are some concrete steps you can take to get the SRE ball rolling? In this blog post, weâll take a look at what you as an IT leader can do to fast-track SRE within your team.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStep 1: Start small and iterateÂ \u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\"Rome wasn't built in a day,\" the saying goes, but you do need to start somewhere. When it comes to implementing SRE principles, the approach that I (and my team) found to be the most effective is to start with a proof of concept, learn from our mistakes, and iterate!\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eStart by identifying a relevant application and/or teamÂ \u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are many factors that go into choosing a specific team or application for your SRE proof of concept. Most of the time, though, this is a strategic decision for the organization, which is outside the scope of this article. Possible candidates can be a team shifting from traditional operations or DevOps to SRE, or a need to increase reliability to a business-critical product. No matter the reason, itâs crucial to select an application that is:\u003c/p\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eCritical to the business. Your customers should care deeply about its uptime and reliability.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eCurrently in development. Pick an application in which the business is actively investing resources.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn a perfect world, the application provides data and metrics regarding its behaviour.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cp\u003eConversely, stay away from proprietary software. If the application wasnât built by you, it's not a good candidate for SRE! You need the ability to make strategic decisions aboutâand engineering changes toâthe application as needed.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003ePro tip\u003c/b\u003e: In general, if you have workloads both on-premises and in the cloud, try to start with the cloud-based app. If your engineers come from a traditional operations environment, changing their thinking away from 'bare metal' and infrastructure metrics will be easier for a cloud-based app, as managed infrastructure turns practitioners into users and forces them to consume it like developers (APIs, infrastructure as code, etc.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eRemember\u003c/b\u003e: Set realistic goals. Discouraging your team with unrealistic expectations early on will have a negative effect on the initiative.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eStep 2: Empower your teams\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eImplementing SRE principles requires fostering a learning culture, and in that regard, \u003cb\u003eteam enablement\u003c/b\u003e means both training them, i.e., in regards to knowledge, as well as \u003ci\u003eempowering\u003c/i\u003e them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBuilding a training program is a topic in and of itself, but itâs important to think about an \u003cb\u003eenablement strategy\u003c/b\u003e at an early stage. Especially in large organizations, you need to address topics like internal upskilling, hiring and scaling the team as well as onboarding and creating a learning community.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYour enablement strategy should also accommodate employees at different levels and in different functions. For example, higher leadership's training will look very different from practitionersâ training. Leadership's education should be sufficient to get buy-in and to be able to make organizational decisions. To drive change in the entire organization, additional training to leadership on cultural concepts and practices might be required.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-related_article_tout_external\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"uni-related-article-tout h-c-page\"\u003e\u003csection class=\"h-c-grid\"\u003e\u003ca class=\"uni-related-article-tout__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 uni-click-tracker\" data-analytics='{\n                       \"event\": \"page interaction\",\n                       \"category\": \"article lead\",\n                       \"action\": \"related article - inline\",\n                       \"label\": \"article: {slug}\"\n                     }' href=\"\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"uni-related-article-tout__inner-wrapper\"\u003e\u003cp class=\"uni-related-article-tout__eyebrow h-c-eyebrow\"\u003eRelated Article\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"uni-related-article-tout__content-wrapper\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"uni-related-article-tout__image-wrapper\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"uni-related-article-tout__image\" style=\"background-image: url('')\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"uni-related-article-tout__content\"\u003e\u003ch4 class=\"uni-related-article-tout__header h-has-bottom-margin\"\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cp class=\"uni-related-article-tout__body\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"cta module-cta h-c-copy uni-related-article-tout__cta muted\"\u003e\u003cspan class=\"nowrap\"\u003eRead Article\u003csvg class=\"icon h-c-icon\" role=\"presentation\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#mi-arrow-forward\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/section\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-paragraph\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rich-text\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to engineering leadership and/or middle management (managers that manage managers), training should be a combination ofÂ  high-level cultural concepts to help foster the required culture, and technical SRE practices that are deep enough to understand prioritization, resource allocation, process creation, and future needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to practitioners, ideally you want the entire organization to be aligned both from a knowledge perspective as well as culturally.

Service-Level Objective (SLO)\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;SRE begins with the idea that \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/embracing-risk/\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;availability is a prerequisite for success\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. An unavailable system can\u0026amp;#8217;t perform its function and will fail by default. Availability, in SRE terms, defines whether a system is able to fulfill its intended function at a point in time. In addition to its use as a reporting tool, the historical availability measurement can also describe the probability that your system will perform as expected in the future.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When we set out to define the terms of SRE, we wanted to set a precise numerical target for system availability. We term this target the availability \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Service-Level Objective\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; (SLO) of our system. Any future discussion about whether the system is running reliably and if any design or architectural changes to it are needed must be framed in terms of our system continuing to meet this SLO.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Keep in mind that the more reliable the service, the more it costs to operate. Define the lowest level of reliability that is acceptable for users of each service, then state that as your SLO. Every service should have an availability SLO\u0026amp;#8212;without it, your team and your stakeholders can\u0026amp;#8217;t make principled judgments about whether your service needs to be made more reliable (increasing cost and slowing development) or less reliable (allowing greater velocity of development). Excessive availability has become the expectation, which can lead to problems. Don\u0026amp;#8217;t make your system overly reliable if the user experience doesn\u0026amp;#8217;t necessitate it, and especially if you don\u0026amp;#8217;t intend to commit to always reaching that level. You can learn more about this by participating in \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://sre.google/resources/practices-and-processes/art-of-slos/\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;The Art of SLOs\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; training.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026amp;#160;Within Google Cloud, we implement periodic downtime in some services to prevent a service from being overly available. You could also try experimenting with occasional planned-downtime exercises with front-end servers, as we did with one of our internal systems. We found that these exercises can uncover services that are using those servers inappropriately. With that information, you can then move workloads to a more suitable place and keep servers at the right availability level.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;2. Service-Level Agreement (SLA)\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;At Google Cloud, \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/\u0026#34; target=\u0026#34;_blank\u0026#34;\u0026gt;we distinguish between an SLO and a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;. An SLA normally involves a promise to a service user that the service availability SLO should meet a certain level over a certain period. Failing to do so then results in some kind of penalty. This might be a partial refund of the service subscription fee paid by customers for that period, or additional subscription time added for free. Going out of SLO will hurt the service team, so they will push hard to stay within SLO. If you\u0026amp;#8217;re charging your customers money, you\u0026amp;#8217;ll probably need an SLA.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Because of this, and because of the principle that availability shouldn\u0026amp;#8217;t be much better than the SLO, the availability SLO in the SLA is normally a looser objective than the internal availability SLO. This might be expressed in availability numbers: for instance, an availability SLO of 99.9% over one month, with an internal availability SLO of 99.95%. Alternatively, the SLA might only specify a subset of the metrics that make up the internal SLO.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you have an SLO in your SLA that is different from your internal SLO (as it almost always is), it\u0026amp;#8217;s important for your monitoring to explicitly measure SLO compliance. You want to be able to view your system\u0026amp;#8217;s availability over the SLA calendar period, and quickly see if it appears to be in danger of going out of SLO.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;You\u0026amp;#8217;ll also need a precise measurement of compliance, usually from logs analysis. Since we have an extra set of obligations (described in the SLA) to paying customers, we need to measure queries received from them separately from other queries. This is another benefit of establishing an SLA\u0026amp;#8212;it\u0026amp;#8217;s an unambiguous way to prioritize traffic.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;When you define your SLA\u0026amp;#8217;s availability SLO, be careful about which queries you count as legitimate. For example, if a customer goes over quota because they released a buggy version of their mobile client, you may consider excluding all \u0026amp;#8220;out of quota\u0026amp;#8221; response codes from your SLA accounting.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;3. Service-Level Indicator (SLI)\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Our Service-Level Indicator (SLI) is a direct measurement of a service\u0026amp;#8217;s behavior, defined as the frequency of successful probes of our system. When we evaluate whether our system has been running within SLO for the past week, \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/management-tools/tune-up-your-sli-metrics-cre-life-lessons\u0026#34;\u0026gt;we look at the SLI\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; to get the service availability percentage. If it goes below the specified SLO, we have a problem and may need to make the system more available in some way, such as by running a second instance of the service in a different city and load-balancing between the two. If you want to know how reliable your service is, you must be able to measure the rates of successful and unsuccessful queries as your SLIs.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;If you\u0026amp;#8217;re building a system from scratch, make sure that SLIs and SLOs are part of your system requirements. If you already have a production system but don\u0026amp;#8217;t have them clearly defined, then that\u0026amp;#8217;s your highest priority work.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eA big part of \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/available-or-not-that-is-the-question-cre-life-lessons\" track-type=\"inline link\" track-name=\"1\" track-metadata-eventdetail=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/available-or-not-that-is-the-question-cre-life-lessons\" track-metadata-module=\"post\"\u003eensuring the availability of your applications\u003c/a\u003e is establishing and monitoring service-level metricsâsomething that our \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/\" target=\"_blank\" track-type=\"inline link\" track-name=\"2\" track-metadata-eventdetail=\"https://sre.google\" track-metadata-module=\"post\"\u003eSite Reliability Engineering\u003c/a\u003e (SRE) team does every day here at Google Cloud.

This is another benefit of establishing an SLAâitâs an unambiguous way to prioritize traffic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you define your SLAâs availability SLO, be careful about which queries you count as legitimate.

The end goal of our SRE principles is to improve services and in turn the user experience.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe concept of SRE starts with the idea that metrics should be closely tied to business objectives. In addition to business-level SLAs, we also use \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/availability-part-deux-cre-life-lessons\"\u003eSLOs and SLIs\u003c/a\u003e in SRE planning and practice.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDefining the terms of site reliability engineering\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThese tools arenât just useful abstractions. Without them, you wonât know if your system is reliable, available, or even useful. If the tools donât tie back to your business objectives, then youâll be missing data on whether your choices are helping or hurting your business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a refresher, hereâs a look at SLOs, SLAs, and SLIS, as discussed by our Customer Reliability Engineering team in their blog post, \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/availability-part-deux-cre-life-lessons\"\u003eSLOs, SLIs, SLAs, oh my - CRE life lessons\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e1. Service-Level Objective (SLO)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eSRE begins with the idea that \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/embracing-risk/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eavailability is a prerequisite for success\u003c/a\u003e. An unavailable system canât perform its function and will fail by default. Availability, in SRE terms, defines whether a system is able to fulfill its intended function at a point in time. In addition to its use as a reporting tool, the historical availability measurement can also describe the probability that your system will perform as expected in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen we set out to define the terms of SRE, we wanted to set a precise numerical target for system availability. We term this target the availability \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eService-Level Objective\u003c/a\u003e (SLO) of our system. Any future discussion about whether the system is running reliably and if any design or architectural changes to it are needed must be framed in terms of our system continuing to meet this SLO.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeep in mind that the more reliable the service, the more it costs to operate. Define the lowest level of reliability that is acceptable for users of each service, then state that as your SLO. Every service should have an availability SLOâwithout it, your team and your stakeholders canât make principled judgments about whether your service needs to be made more reliable (increasing cost and slowing development) or less reliable (allowing greater velocity of development). Excessive availability has become the expectation, which can lead to problems. Donât make your system overly reliable if the user experience doesnât necessitate it, and especially if you donât intend to commit to always reaching that level. You can learn more about this by participating in \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/resources/practices-and-processes/art-of-slos/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Art of SLOs\u003c/a\u003e training.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eÂ Within Google Cloud, we implement periodic downtime in some services to prevent a service from being overly available. You could also try experimenting with occasional planned-downtime exercises with front-end servers, as we did with one of our internal systems. We found that these exercises can uncover services that are using those servers inappropriately. With that information, you can then move workloads to a more suitable place and keep servers at the right availability level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003e2. Service-Level Agreement (SLA)\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt Google Cloud, \u003ca href=\"https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewe distinguish between an SLO and a Service-Level Agreement (SLA)\u003c/a\u003e. An SLA normally involves a promise to a service user that the service availability SLO should meet a certain level over a certain period. Failing to do so then results in some kind of penalty. This might be a partial refund of the service subscription fee paid by customers for that period, or additional subscription time added for free. Going out of SLO will hurt the service team, so they will push hard to stay within SLO. If youâre charging your customers money, youâll probably need an SLA.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBecause of this, and because of the principle that availability shouldnât be much better than the SLO, the availability SLO in the SLA is normally a looser objective than the internal availability SLO. This might be expressed in availability numbers: for instance, an availability SLO of 99.9% over one month, with an internal availability SLO of 99.95%. Alternatively, the SLA might only specify a subset of the metrics that make up the internal SLO.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you have an SLO in your SLA that is different from your internal SLO (as it almost always is), itâs important for your monitoring to explicitly measure SLO compliance. You want to be able to view your systemâs availability over the SLA calendar period, and quickly see if it appears to be in danger of going out of SLO.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYouâll also need a precise measurement of compliance, usually from logs analysis.

However, declaring a configuration is only half the battle: you also want policy that defines how a configuration is to be used.\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Configuration as Data enables a normalized policy contract across all your cloud resources. That contract, knowing how your deployment will operate, can be inspected and enforced throughout a CI/CD pipeline, from upstream in your development environment to deployment time, and ongoing in the live runtime environment. This consistency is possible by expressing configuration as data throughout the development and operations lifecycle.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Config Connector\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; is the tool that allows you to express configuration as data in Google Cloud. In this model, configuration is what you want to deploy, such as \u0026amp;#8220;a storage bucket named \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;my-bucket\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; with a standard storage class and uniform access control.\u0026amp;#8221;\u0026amp;#160;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Policy, meanwhile, typically specifies what you\u0026amp;#8217;re allowed to deploy, usually in conformance with your organization\u0026amp;#8217;s compliance needs.

However, declaring a configuration is only half the battle: you also want policy that defines how a configuration is to be used.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConfiguration as Data enables a normalized policy contract across all your cloud resources. That contract, knowing how your deployment will operate, can be inspected and enforced throughout a CI/CD pipeline, from upstream in your development environment to deployment time, and ongoing in the live runtime environment. This consistency is possible by expressing configuration as data throughout the development and operations lifecycle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview\"\u003eConfig Connector\u003c/a\u003e is the tool that allows you to express configuration as data in Google Cloud. In this model, configuration is what you want to deploy, such as âa storage bucket named \u003ccode\u003emy-bucket\u003c/code\u003e with a standard storage class and uniform access control.âÂ \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePolicy, meanwhile, typically specifies what youâre allowed to deploy, usually in conformance with your organizationâs compliance needs. For example, âall resources must be deployed in Google Cloudâs \u003ccode\u003eLONDON\u003c/code\u003e region.âÂ \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen each stage in your pipeline treats configuration as data, you can use any tool or language to manipulate configuration as data, knowing they will interoperate and that policy can be consistently enforced at any or all stages. And while a policy engine wonât be able to understand every tool, it can validate the data generated by each tool.

You can manage commit and merge permissions separately for config and policy to separate these distinct concerns. You can have folders and unique permissions for org-wide policy, team-wide policy, or app-specific policy. Therein lies the dream.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most common way to generate configuration is to simply write a YAML file describing how Kubernetes should create a resource for you. The resulting YAML file is then stored in a git repository where it can be versioned and picked up by another tool and applied to a Kubernetes cluster. Policies can be enforced on the git repo side to limit who can push changes to the repository and ultimately reference them at deploy time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor most users this is not where policy enforcement ends. While code reviews can catch a lot of things, itâs considered best practice to âtrust but verifyâ at all layers in the stack. Thatâs where admission controllers come in, which can be considered to be the last mile of policy enforcement. \u003ca href=\"https://www.openpolicyagent.org/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGatekeeper\u003c/a\u003e serves as an admission controller inside of a Kubernetes cluster.

Imagine you want to enable users to create Cloud Storage buckets, but you donât want them doing so using the Google Cloud Console or the gcloud command line tool. You want all users to declare what they want and push those changes to a git repository for review before the underlying Cloud Storage buckets are created with \u003ca href=\"https://cloud.google.com/config-connector/docs/overview\"\u003eConfig Connector\u003c/a\u003e. Essentially you want users to be able to submit a YAML file that looks like this:\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-code\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-module h-c-page\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-paragraph\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rich-text\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis creates a storage bucket in a default location.

So, now, if you set location to âUSâ you can deploy the Cloud Storage bucket. You can also apply this type of location policy or any other like it to all of your resource typesâRedis instances, Compute Engine virtual machines, even Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters. Beyond admission control, you can apply the same constraint anywhere in your pipeline, by âshifting leftâ policy validation at any stage.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eOne contract to rule them all\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen config is managed in silosâwhether across many tools, pipelines, graphical interfaces, and command linesâyou canât inject logic without building bespoke tools for every interface.

Or you can wait until deployment time to scan for deviations and hope nothing appears during crunch time.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCompare that with configuration as data contracts, which are transparent and normalized across resource types, which has facilitated a rich ecosystem of tooling built around Kubernetes with varied syntax (YAML, JSON) and languages including Ruby, Typescript, Go, Jinja, Mustache, Jsonnet, Starlark, and many others.

To deploy the app in your own cluster, create a container image using Cloud Build and \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/yuriatgoogle/stack-doctor/blob/master/crashing-pod-demo/deployment.yaml\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edeploy\u003c/a\u003e it to GKE. Then, expose the service with a load balancer.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce the service is deployed, check the running pods:\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-code\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"article-module h-c-page\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"\u003e\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"block-paragraph\"\u003e\u003cdiv class=\"rich-text\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eNotice that RESTARTS is initially at zero for each pod.

Well, restarts, to a certain degree, are an expected part of a containerâs typical lifecycle in Kubernetes. Too many container restarts, however, could affect the availability of your service, especially when expanded over a larger number of replicas for a given Pod. Not only do excessive restarts degrade the service in question, but they also risks affecting other services downstream that use it as a dependency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn real life,the culprit for a large number of restarts could be a poorly designed liveness probe, issues like \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edeadlocks\u003c/a\u003e in the application itself, or misconfigured memory requests that result in \u003ca href=\"https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-memory-resource/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003eOOMkilled\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/a\u003e errors. So, it is important for you to proactively alert on container restarts to preempt potential degradation that can cascade across multiple services.Â \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eConfigure the alert\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/b\u003eNow, you're ready to configure the alert that will notify you when restarts are detected.
