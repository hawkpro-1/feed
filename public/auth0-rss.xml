      <title>Streamlining a React Monorepo</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/streamlining-a-react-monorepo/</link>
      <description>Whether you have a single application or a suite of applications, code reuse, standards around structure, process, and feature development help to ensure your codebase remains healthy in the long term.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nx is a build framework for monorepos</a> with first-class React support. It helps accelerate the adoption of proven development practices across projects of many sizes and scopes. Nx provides additional tooling for React projects to help scale and develop features at a faster pace. </p><p>This guide walks through some of the tooling provided by Nx, the creation, and structure of an Nx workspace, with an example to follow along with.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IMWk0P6EeRc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 id="What-are-Monorepos">What are Monorepos</h2><p>A monorepo is a single collection of all your source code that spans multiple applications, libraries, and languages. Everything in the monorepo is not deployed at the same time but is all located in a central repository. Many companies use monorepos for different organizations and projects. Some even use a single monorepo to house all the source code for projects across their entire company.</p><p>Here are some of the benefits of a monorepo:</p><ul><li><strong>Shared code</strong> — Promotes reuse of validation code, UI components, and types across the code base, including code between the backend and the frontend.</li><li><strong>Atomic changes</strong> — Make changes to a server API and modify the clients that consume that API in the same commit. No more coordinating commits across different repositories.</li><li><strong>Developer mobility</strong> — Provides consistency between building and testing applications written using different tools and technologies. Developers can confidently contribute to other teams’ applications and verify that their changes are safe.</li><li><strong>A single set of dependencies</strong> — Use a single version of third-party dependencies for all your apps. Less frequently used applications don’t get left behind with a 3-year-old version of a framework library or an old version of a build tool.</li></ul><p>There are also a few common misconceptions with monorepos:</p><ul><li>Strictly co-locating your code just by placing all your code in the same repository.</li><li>Running all the builds, tests, and quality checks on all applications for each PR or commit.</li><li>Deploying every application on every commit to the main branch.</li><li>Setting up multiple scripts across applications to handle common tasks.</li></ul><p>Just because you have all your code in a monorepo, that does not mean you have run all the tests and checks on your monorepo for every single commit. This doesn&#39;t scale well and leads to bottlenecks in your development and Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipelines. Nx provides integrated tooling to intelligently determine what needs to be run through code analysis, affected commands, and computation caching. </p><h3 id="Affected-commands">Affected commands</h3><p>Nx uses code analysis to build a dependency graph of all projects in the workspace. It then uses the dependency graph to determine what projects are impacted based on your changes between your Git branches and the main branch. <a href="https://nx.dev/latest/react/core-concepts/mental-model#affected-commands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nx’s Affected Commands</a> use this code analysis to perform the minimum set of tasks based on what&#39;s changed. Let’s look at two applications that depend on a library as an example.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/3Msqcbm3M7zreqA7s3Yga/fa9a14ab5dd0970d45ff8603494a2530/Uploaded_from_Streamlining_a_React_Monorepo"/></p><p>To see what applications are affected, use the <strong><a href="https://nx.dev/latest/angular/cli/affected-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nx affected:apps command</a></strong>. Nx analyzes the nature of the changes and determines which projects, including applications and libraries, are impacted. In the example above, changing app1 doesn’t cause app2 to be impacted, so you don’t need to run all the pre-merge steps for app2. Alternatively, changing the lib, or packages that both apps depend on does impact both applications.</p><h3 id="Computation-caching">Computation caching</h3><p>Nx is smart in that it also knows the context in which you ran particular commands, the current hash of the files, and other environmental information. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/1gsO5lGTZaluzgHVc3H3xr/f931ae116060c2def80962a764b4888b/Uploaded_from_Streamlining_a_React_Monorepo"/></p><p>The image above displays an example of the information collected to build a unique hash used to identify the computation. With this information, Nx caches and stores these computations and can replay them if it seems the same computation is being run again.</p><p>This isn’t done through rebuilding source code. Only the artifacts produced from a given command are stored and replayed when possible. If Nx doesn’t find this computation, Nx runs the task, and after it completes, it takes the outputs and the terminal output and stores it locally (and if configured remotely). All of this happens transparently, so you don’t have to worry about it.</p><h2 id="Creating-an-Nx-Workspace-Using-a-React-Preset">Creating an Nx Workspace Using a React Preset</h2><p>Now that you know how Nx works, let’s try it out by building a small application that lists Star Wars characters.</p><p>Start with creating the Nx workspace with a React application using the <code>react</code> preset. </p><pre><code>npx create-nx-workspace sw-org --preset react --appName myapp</code></pre><p>After running this command, you’ll be asked to select a stylesheet format. You can choose the default for this demo. You also have the option to connect your workspace to <a href="https://nx.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nx Cloud</a> if you’d like.</p><p>After you make your selections, this command does the following:</p><ul><li>Generates a new Nx workspace</li><li>Scaffolds out a new React application with modern tooling, including <a href="https://jestjs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jest for unit tests</a>, and <a href="https://www.cypress.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cypress for E2E tests</a>.</li></ul><p>There are other presets available, such as <code>next</code> for <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Next.js</a> projects, and <code>react<span>-</span>express</code> for a workspace with React and Express pre-configured.</p><p>Every Nx workspace has a file structure similar to this:</p><pre><code>myorg/
├── apps/
├── libs/
├── tools/
├── workspace.json
├── nx.json
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.base.json</code></pre><ul><li><code><span><span>/</span><span>apps</span><span>/</span></span></code> contains the application projects. This is the main entry point for each runnable application.</li><li><code><span><span>/</span><span>libs</span><span>/</span></span></code> contains the library projects. Each library defines its external API so that boundaries between libraries remain clear.</li><li><code><span><span>/</span><span>tools</span><span>/</span></span></code> contains scripts that act on your codebase.</li><li><code><span>/</span>workspace<span>.</span>json</code> contains the configuration for each project in your workspace.</li><li><code><span>/</span>nx<span>.</span>json</code> adds extra information about projects, including implicit dependencies and tags that can be used to restrict the ways projects are allowed to depend on each other.</li><li><code><span>/</span>tsconfig<span>.</span>base<span>.</span>json</code> sets up the global TypeScript settings and aliases.</li></ul><p>To serve up the application, enter into the <code>sw<span>-</span>org</code> directory and run the <code>serve</code> command using the Nx CLI:</p><pre><code>nx serve</code></pre><blockquote><p>Note: If you don&#39;t want to install Nx globally, you can use <code>npx nx serve</code> instead.</p></blockquote><p>The initial application page is displayed.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/2EUaKnrpRkLehJempAp06f/a99c92b3282e79e42b16877c98cac1c9/Uploaded_from_Streamlining_a_React_Monorepo"/></p><h2 id="Generating-a-Feature-Library">Generating a Feature Library</h2><p><a href="https://nx.dev/latest/react/structure/library-types#feature-libraries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Generating libraries</a> in an Nx workspace is done by using the <code>generate</code> command with the Nx CLI. Feature libraries are used to display UI to the user, which could including routing information, and could use other libraries such as shared components.</p><p>Create one now by running:</p><pre><code>nx generate lib people</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE</strong> <a href="https://nx.dev/latest/angular/getting-started/console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nx Console</a> also provides a full l GUI to run Nx CLI commands in your editor with native VSCode and WebStorm support.</p><h2 id="Generating-a-Data-Access-Library">Generating a Data Access Library</h2><p>A &#34;data access&#34; library is where functionality for fetching and storing data for a feature exists. So any services necessary to manage the quotes are placed in this library. Throughout building applications, there will be data access libraries across multiple features.</p><p>Create the data access library by running:</p><pre><code>nx generate lib data-access</code></pre><p><strong>NOTE</strong> You can also create your custom generators similar to the <code>library</code> generator inside an Nx workspace. This provides more flexibility to create more standards around your development processes and guidelines.

      <title>4 Authentication Tools That Increase Retail Conversion Rates</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/four-authentication-tools-that-increase-retail-conversion-rates/</link>
      <description>How to decrease abandoned carts by improving the simplicity and security of your user login process.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When consumers create e-commerce accounts, retailers can use their purchasing history to offer a more personalized shopping experience, which can boost <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/personalizing-the-customer-experience-driving-differentiation-in-retail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">retail conversion rates</a> by up to 15%. However, it is tough for retailers to convince people to actually sign up — case in point, <a href="https://baymard.com/lists/cart-abandonment-rate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 2021 DMI survey</a> found that 24% of U.S. shoppers abandoned an order just because they were asked to make an account.</p><p>We <a href="https://images.ctfassets.net/2ntc334xpx65/7o4UAUaHOMHJeV5fmgK9S1/b4c300762c64becf6cef5989046aaf8f/Infograph_2_2x.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surveyed</a> over 8,000 consumers across six global markets (the UK, France, Germany, Australia, Singapore, and Japan) to learn about the login experience they preferred and discovered widespread frustration with standard username/password (UP) login methods and businesses that fail to meet their ease-of-login expectations.</p><p>Our survey found five problems that stop consumers from signing up for an online account:</p><ol start="1"><li>Completing long login or sign-up forms (49%)</li><li>Meeting minimum password requirements (47%)</li><li>Entering private information (46%)</li><li>Creating a new ID and password for every app or online service (43%)</li><li>Verifying their account with one-time passwords (OTP) (23%)</li></ol><p>Such frustrations lead to some of the worst security hygiene offenses, in particular, reuse of passwords across multiple accounts. Our survey found that 85% of international consumers reuse passwords, with 41% of them doing so “frequently or all the time” and 29% “sometimes”.</p><p>We asked consumers about the kind of login experience that would increase their chances of signing up for an account and found that adding certain authentication features would actually encourage them to do so. Our survey results indicated that, when available, consumers are more likely to complete the signup process if given more secure and easy-to-use login experiences.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/24uCeR7yhZbNmMpbFE7v3v/c2245aa707cc9d83b5242357ed06ac39/Passwordless-Authentication-sep1.jpg" alt="Authentication 01"/></p><p>Below are four authentication tools that can improve your retail conversion rate by creating a more streamlined, secure login experience that satisfies users.</p><h2 id="1--Multi-factor-Authentication--MFA-">1. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)</h2><p><a href="https://auth0.com/learn/get-started-with-mfa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MFA</a> requires users to verify their identity in more than one way, which helps reduce the potential for unauthorized access to their data. For instance, a user may submit a password and then have to additionally verify a secondary account or device they own using a link sent to their email address or phone.</p><p>Consumers want to know that companies are protecting their data. In a 2020 survey with 1,000 North American consumers asked about privacy and data collection, management consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Company found that <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">87% of respondents said</a> they “would not do business with a company if they had concerns about its security practices.” MFA helps retailers provide consumers with greater confidence their data is protected because it blocks <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">99.9% of attacks</a>.</p><p>While 49% of our surveyed consumers noted they were more likely to sign up for an online account if a business offered MFA, only 28% of surveyed businesses currently offered it as part of their login process. This discrepancy arises from the perception that the multiple steps in MFA mean extra hassle for both users and the business.</p><p>However, MFA is actually fairly easy to implement — many companies <a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/15793/483340/451-research-report-remote-work-during-covid-19-drives-mfa-adoption" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quickly adopted it</a> when COVID-19 forced them to pivot to a remote workforce in 2020.</p><p><strong>Company use example</strong>: According to <a href="https://auth0.com/case-studies/ecobee/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Christensen</a>, VP of Technology at <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ecobee</a>, the smart device retailer wanted to protect consumers using ecobee’s home monitoring products, so they outsourced MFA implementation. His team was thrilled they were able to bring MFA to customers “without needing to reinvent the wheel.”</p><h2 id="2--Biometrics">2. Biometrics</h2><p><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/what-are-biometrics-the-proscons-of-biometric-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Biometrics</a> uses measurable human traits, characteristics, or behaviors to confirm user identity. Fingerprint scans and facial recognition are two of the most common forms of biometrics, but there’s a growing list that includes options like voice, gait, and even DNA recognition.</p><p>Biometric traits are harder for hackers to fake than usernames and passwords, so they can help mitigate security concerns that could keep consumers from signing up. <a href="https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/security/how-fingerprint-authentication-works.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Consumers</a> also like it because it’s faster than username/password authentication, and they don’t have to struggle with remembering login credentials.</p><p>While 46% of our surveyed consumers responded that they’d be more likely to log in if they could use biometrics, only 21% of the businesses we surveyed currently offered it — the biggest consumer-business gap we found in the study. Taking steps to close the gap between consumer expectations and current business practices will result in a better customer experience and better retail conversion rates.</p><p>Steven Rees-Pullman, SVP, International at Auth0, explains that it can be a <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/businesses-fall-short-of-consumer-expectations-for-login-experiences-auth0-survey-reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“heavy lift”</a> for businesses to develop biometric authentication in-house due to factors like limited bandwidth of IT employees or a lack of expertise with the process. To prevent diverting company resources and adding additional stress on already busy IT teams, some companies are instead choosing to outsource implementation to third-party providers that specialize in identity management and already have <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/mfa/configure-webauthn-device-biometrics-for-mfa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experience with biometrics</a>.</p><p><strong>Company use example</strong>: Consumer use of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft’s</a> biometric authentication tool Windows Hello, which lets users log in with a face, iris, or fingerprint scan instead of a password, jumped from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/17/a-breakthrough-year-for-passwordless-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">69.4% to 84.7%</a> in 2019 alone. Additionally, <a href="https://www.disney.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Disney</a> started experimenting with a <a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2021/04/disney-world-facial-recognition-ks1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">facial recognition system</a> at Walt Disney World’s Magic Kingdom theme park this year and was using <a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2020/10/disney-fingerprint-scanning-kj1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fingerprint scanning</a> to prevent ticket fraud before COVID-19 hit.</p><p><a href="https://auth0.com/learn/social-login/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Social logins</a> use existing login information from a social network provider that allows consumers to access a third-party website account without having to create another one. While the number of social providers <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22422980/tiktok-log-in-sound-kit-app-integration-developers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keeps growing</a>, staple networks include Facebook, Google, and Twitter.</p><p>Consumers prefer social logins to traditional UP authentication because they typically allow them to create and log in to accounts with just one click. As a result, social logins generally <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-use-social-login-to-drive-your-apps-growth/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boost conversion rates</a> by up to 20% — though some companies report seeing <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-impact-does-social-login-have-on-conversion-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as high as 40%</a>. Social logins also provide access to rich user data, allowing you to use more customized, targeted marketing with individual consumers.</p><p>Our survey found there wasn’t a huge gap between consumers and businesses with social logins, with 37% of consumers noting they were more likely to sign up with it and 31% of businesses currently offering it.</p><p>Social logins are typically connected to larger companies with established data privacy measures, but security can be compromised if users are reusing passwords. Martin Gontovnikas, former VP of Marketing at Auth0, says consumers using social logins should <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/social-login-on-the-rise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vary their passwords across platforms</a>, and you can choose to boost the security strength of social logins by combining it with MFA.</p><p><strong>Company use example:</strong> Kevin Ho, VP of Marketing for marketing agency <a href="https://www.wishpond.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WishPond</a>, found that after featuring a social login option more prominently than UP authentication, the company saw an <a href="https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675436270/how-we-improved-sign-up-rates-by-8-5-with-this-simple-test" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5% increase</a> in their conversions.</p><h2 id="4--Passwordless">4. Passwordless</h2><p><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/2ntc334xpx65/3Ew2LXo2UJDQdlSukeQxwq/de57802e6a5da4a58de15ee68b42ccf5/Passwordless-Whitepaper-Auth0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Passwordless</a> authentication is exactly what it sounds like: confirming a consumer’s identity with something different from a password. Outside of biometrics, typical passwordless options include magic links, where a user is sent a link to log in after submitting their email, one-time codes, and push notifications.</p><p>With the average consumer having <a href="https://tech.co/news/average-person-100-passwords#:~:text=According%20to%20new%20research%20from,has%20100%20passwords%20to%20remember!" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">approximately 100 passwords</a>, passwordless authentication reduces potential user frustration with logins. Not having traditional UP authentication also means increased data security, with Verizon noting in its <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021 Data Breach Investigations Report</a> that stolen login credentials are the main way organizations get hacked. Next Move Strategy Consulting published a report <a href="https://www.nextmsc.com/report/passwordless-authentication-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this month</a> predicting that the global passwordless authentication market will grow by 29.1% by 2030.</p><p>Even so, passwordless authentication came in last in our survey in terms of both consumer likelihood to sign up with it (34%) and business use (20%). Traditionally, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/20/why-is-passwordless-authentication-met-with-reluctance/?sh=5a946c366d06" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IT infrastructure</a> at large companies has been set up for UP authentication, so it can be a complex process for businesses to implement passwordless tech on a wide scale.</p><p>According to Cybersecurity Insiders’ 2021 <a href="https://media.fidoalliance.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/The_State_Of_Passwordless_Authentication_2021_Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“The State of Passwordless Authentication”</a> report, many organizations that have chosen to implement passwordless authentication have done so because of its proven security, ease of use, and ability to “help consumer-facing businesses increase revenue.” Microsoft also reported that <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/12/17/a-breakthrough-year-for-passwordless-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 150 million users</a> were using passwordless authentication on Windows in May 2020.</p><p><strong>Company use example:</strong> Kunal Chakraborty, Global Vice President for Customer Experience and Digital at <a href="https://www.grandvision.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GrandVision</a>, the optical retailer, said the company made <a href="https://auth0.com/case-studies/grandvision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“the checkout process as customer-friendly as possible”</a> by having a third-party provider implement passwordless authentication — accounts are created just by clicking a box.

      <title>Backend For Frontend Authentication Pattern with Auth0 and ASP.NET Core</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/backend-for-frontend-pattern-with-auth0-and-dotnet/</link>
      <description>Understand the Backend For Frontend authentication pattern and how it can be implemented in ASP.NET with Auth0.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This article discusses the Backend For Frontend authentication pattern and how it can be used in practice in SPAs implemented with React that use ASP.NET Core 5 as backend. Basic knowledge of the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect is desirable but not required.</p><h2 id="What-Is-the-Backend-For-Frontend-Authentication-Pattern-">What Is the Backend For Frontend Authentication Pattern?</h2><p>As you start looking into the different <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/flows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OAuth flows</a> and the scenarios they cover, client type is one of those relevant aspects mentioned everywhere. The <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OAuth 2.0 specification</a> defines two different client types, public and confidential clients, under <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-2.1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">section #2.1</a>.</p><p>Public clients are those that run in places where secrets could be exposed as part of the source code or if the binaries are decompiled. These usually are single-page apps running in a browser or native apps running in user devices such as mobile phones or smart TVs. </p><p>On the other hand, confidential clients are the ones that can keep secrets in a private store, like, for example, a web application running in a web server, which can store secrets on the backend. </p><p>The client type will determine one or more OAuth flows suitable for the application implementation. By sticking to one of those flows, you can also lower the risks of getting the application compromised from an authentication and authorization standpoint.</p><p>The <strong>Backend For Frontend</strong> (a.k.a BFF) pattern for authentication emerged to mitigate any risk that may occur from negotiating and handling access tokens from public clients running in a browser.  The name also implies that a dedicated backend must be available for performing all the authorization code exchange and handling of the access and refresh tokens. This pattern relies on <a href="https://openid.net/connect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenID Connect</a>, which is an authentication layer that runs on top of OAuth to request and receive identity information about authenticated users.</p><blockquote><p>This pattern does not work for a pure SPA that relies on calling external APIs directly from javascript or a serverless backend (e.g., AWS Lamba or Azure Functions).</p></blockquote><p>The following diagram illustrates how this pattern works in detail:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/7b2OEjgWLrP5EBOnPNK4MH/b9970c5cce10ee594477493785b17efb/BFF-Sequence.png" alt="BFF sequence diagram"/></p><ol start="1"><li>When the frontend needs to authenticate the user, it calls an API endpoint (<code><span>/</span>api<span>/</span>login</code>) on the backend to start the login handshake.</li><li>The backend uses OpenID connect with Auth0 to authenticate the user and getting the id, access, and refresh tokens.</li><li>The backend stores the user&#39;s tokens in a cache.</li><li>An encrypted cookie is issued for the frontend representing the user authentication session.</li><li>When the frontend needs to call an external API, it passes the encrypted cookie to the backend together with the URL and data to invoke the API.</li><li>The backend retrieves the access token from the cache and makes a call to the external API including that token on the authorization header.</li><li>When the external API returns a response to the backend, this one forwards that response back to the frontend.</li></ol><h2 id="Backend-For-FrontEnd-in-ASP-NET-Core">Backend For FrontEnd in ASP.NET Core</h2><p>Visual Studio ships with three templates for SPAs with an ASP.NET Core backend. As shown in the following picture, those templates are ASP.NET Core with Angular, ASP.NET Core with React.js, and ASP.NET Core with React.js and Redux, which includes all the necessary plumbing for using Redux.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/4m19OOAccdvvxPsriVyior/9062c17f8c3a39820932ab0ff2789185/visualstudio-aspnet-templates.png" alt="Available templates for SPA and ASP.NET Core"/></p><p>As part of this article, we will be discussing how to implement this pattern with the ASP.NET Core with React.js template.</p><p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/auth0-blog/bff-auth0-dotnet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this GitHub repository</a> as a reference for the project you are about to build. </p><h3 id="The-structure-of-the-project">The structure of the project</h3><p>Projects created with that template from Visual Studio will have the following folder structure.</p><ul><li><code>ClientApp</code>, this folder contains a sample SPA implemented with React.js. This is the app that we will modify to support the BFF pattern.</li><li><code>Controllers</code>, this folder contains the controllers implemented with ASP.NET Core for the API consumed from the SPA. In other words, it&#39;s the backend.</li><li><code>Pages</code>, this folder contains server-side pages, which are mostly used for rendering errors on the backend.</li><li><code>Startups<span>.</span>cs</code>, this is the file containing the main class where the ASP.NET Core middleware classes are configured as well as the dependency injection container.</li></ul><p>Before modifying any code, we will proceed to configure first our application in Auth0. That configuration will give us access to the keys and authentication endpoints for the OpenID middleware in .NET Core.</p><h2 id="Auth0-Configuration">Auth0 Configuration</h2><p>To start, you need to access your <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Auth0 Dashboard</a>. If you don&#39;t have an Auth0 account, you can <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up for a free one</a> right now!</p><h3 id="Create-an-application-in-the-Auth0-Dashboard">Create an application in the Auth0 Dashboard</h3><p>The first thing we will do is to create a new brand application in the Auth0 Dashboard. An Auth0 application is an entry point for getting the keys and endpoints we will need in our web application.
Go to your dashboard, click on the <em>Applications</em> menu on the left, and then <em>Create Application</em>.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/MTviQ3xdr6MFQQtkMFQ0n/123341f4c3cafaa17da2a8bac62e775e/auth0-dashboard-applications.png" alt="Applications section in the Auth0 Dashboard"/></p><p>The <em>Create Application</em> button will start a wizard to define the configuration of our application. Pick a name for your web application, and select the option <em>Regular Web Applications</em>. Do not confuse your application with a Single Page Web Application. Even if we are going to implement a SPA with React, we will rely on the .NET Core backend to negotiate the ID tokens. When choosing <em>Regular Web Applications</em>, we are telling Auth0 that our application will use the <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/flows/authorization-code-flow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Authorization Code Flow</a>, which requires a backend channel to receive the ID token for OpenID Connect, and that is exactly what we need to get that magic happening in our ASP.NET Core backend.</p><p> <img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/34sDIegR1jupeg8G8tJyjE/8bcef77e2d95415396876b996d8547c6/auth0-dashboard-create-application.png" alt="Creating applications in the Auth0 Dashboard"/></p><p>Once the application is created, go to the <em>Settings</em> tab and take note of the following settings:</p><ul><li>Domain</li><li>Client ID</li><li>Client Secret</li></ul><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/2YsEWLtSCwuUKt8ba2kRSx/e5d403296c36a4c506d87ce7b5dd711f/auth0-app-configuration-settings.png" alt="Auth0 app configuration settings"/></p><p>Those are the ones you will need to configure the OpenID middleware in the web application.</p><h3 id="Configure-the-Callback-URL">Configure the Callback URL</h3><p>The next thing is to configure the Callback URL for our web application. This is the URL where Auth0 will post the authorization code and ID token for OpenID Connect. 
This URL can be added in the Allowed URLs field for our application. For our sample, we will use <a href="https://localhost:5001/callback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://localhost:5001/callback</a>. If you are planning to deploy the application to a different URL, you will also need to ensure it is listed here.</p><h3 id="Configure-the-Logout-URL">Configure the Logout URL</h3><p>The logout URL is where Auth0 will redirect the user after the logout process has been completed. Our web application will pass this URL to Auth0 as part of <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/logout/redirect-users-after-logout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the <code>returnTo</code> query string parameter</a>. The logout URL for your app must be added to the <em>Allowed Logout URLs</em> field under the application settings, or Auth0 will return an error otherwise when the user tries to do a logout. For our sample, we will use <a href="https://localhost:5001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://localhost:5001</a>.</p><h3 id="Create-an-API-in-the-Auth0-Dashboard">Create an API in the Auth0 Dashboard</h3><p>We also need to create an Auth0 API in the Auth0 Dashboard. So, go to the APIs section and click on <em>Create API</em>, as shown in the following picture:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/41FoW31W6boGVYrtkfnyhK/2efc80b19495ecb27699ccc62052f14d/auth0-dashboard-create-api.png" alt="Creating an API in the Auth0 Dashboard"/></p><p>This will open a new window for configuring the API. Configure the following fields under the settings tab in that window.</p><ul><li><strong>Name</strong>, a friendly name or description for the API. Enter <strong>Weather Forecast API</strong> for this sample.</li><li><strong>Identifier</strong> or <strong>Audience</strong>, which is an identifier that the client application uses to request access tokens for the API. Enter the string <code>https<span>:</span><span>/</span><span>/</span>weatherforecast</code>.</li></ul><p>Under the permissions tab, add a new permission <code>read<span>:</span>weather</code> with the description <em>It allows getting the weather forecast</em>. This is the scope that Auth0 will inject in the access token if the user approves it in the consent screen. </p><p>Finally, click on the Save button to save the changes. At this point, our API is ready to be used from .NET Core.</p><h2 id="Configuring-the-ASP-NET-Core-Application">Configuring the ASP.NET Core Application</h2><p>Our application will use two middleware: </p><ul><li>The OpenID Connect middleware for handling all the authentication handshake with Auth0.</li><li>The Authentication Cookie middleware for persisting the authentication session in a cookie also sharing it with the frontend running React.</li></ul><p>Open the Package Manager Console for NuGet in Visual Studio and run the following command:</p><pre><code>Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.Cookies
Install-Package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.OpenIdConnect</code></pre><p>Once the Nuget packages are installed in our project, we can go ahead and configure the middleware in the <code>Startup<span>.</span>cs</code> class under the root folder of the ASP.NET Core project.</p><p>Modify the <code>ConfigureServices</code> method in that class to include the following code.</p><pre><code><span>// BFF/Startup.cs</span>

It also injects the cookie middleware with a few settings that restrict how the cookie can be used on the browsers. In our case, the cookie can only be used under HTTPS (<code>CookieSecurePolicy<span>.</span>Always</code>), it&#39;s not available on the client side (<code>HttpOnly <span>=</span> <span>true</span></code>), and uses a site policy equals to strict (<code>SameSiteMode<span>.</span>Strict</code>). This last one implies the cookie will only be sent if the domain for the cookie matches exactly the domain in the browser&#39;s URL. All these settings help to prevent potential attacks with scripting on the client side.</p><pre><code>options<span>.</span>ResponseType <span>=</span> OpenIdConnectResponseType<span>.</span>CodeIdToken<span>;</span>

The parameter uses the &#34;Auth0&#34; value you passed in the call to <code>AddOpenIdConnect</code> in the <code>Startup</code> class.</li><li>The OIDC handler redirects the user to the Auth0&#39;s <code><span>/</span>authorize</code> endpoint, which displays the <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universal Login page</a>. The user can log in with their username and password, social provider, or any other identity provider.</li><li>Once the user has logged in, Auth0 calls back to the <code><span>/</span>callback</code> endpoint in your application and passes along an authorization code.</li><li>The OIDC handler intercepts requests made to the <code><span>/</span>callback</code> path.</li><li>The handler looks for the authorization code, which Auth0 sent in the query string.</li><li>The OIDC handler calls the Auth0&#39;s <code><span>/</span>oauth<span>/</span>token</code> endpoint to exchange the authorization code for the user&#39;s ID and access token.</li><li>The OIDC middleware extracts the user information from the claims in the ID token.</li><li>The OIDC middleware returns a successful authentication response and sets a cookie that indicates that the user is authenticated. The cookie contains the claims with the user&#39;s information. The cookie is stored so that the cookie middleware will automatically authenticate the user on any future requests. The OIDC middleware receives no more requests unless it is explicitly challenged.</li><li>The React application uses the authentication context to issue an API call to the <code>GetUser</code> API.

      <title>What SMART on FHIR Means for the Future of Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/what-smart-on-fhir-means-for-the-future-of-healthcare/</link>
      <description>SMART on FHIR is poised to transform data interoperability — here&#39;s how it will improve healthcare.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most health systems know that seamless omnichannel customer engagement (a “digital front door”) is essential in order to deliver the personalized, value-based <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/health-care/consumer-health-trends.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthcare today’s consumers expect</a>. In practice, however, implementing this digital front door strategy is challenging for <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2021-02/Use-of-Certified-Health-IT-and-Methods-to-Enable-Interoperability-by-U.S.-Non-Federal-Acute-Care-Hospitals-2019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most healthcare systems</a>, due to the <a href="https://www.chiefhealthcareexecutive.com/view/consequences-of-fragmented-healthcare-information-systems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fragmented nature</a> of healthcare information.</p><p>The Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART) platform promises to solve these data fragmentation challenges by standardizing how patient data is accessed and shared. And given SMART’s inclusion in the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/01/2020-07419/21st-century-cures-act-interoperability-information-blocking-and-the-onc-health-it-certification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">21st Century Cures Act</a>, the platform will become the standard protocol for accessing electronic health records (EHRs) in the near future.</p><p>Below, we explain what SMART means for the healthcare ecosystem and how it will improve both health data interoperability and the value of healthcare technology as a whole.</p><h2 id="What-is-SMART-on-FHIR-">What is SMART on FHIR?</h2><p><a href="https://smarthealthit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SMART</a> is an open-source, standards-based <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-an-api-how-apis-work-for-non-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">API</a> that leverages the <a href="https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-oauth-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OAuth 2.0</a> standard to provide secure, universal access to EHRs. The SMART platform builds on the existing Fast Health Interoperability Resources (hence the name &#34;SMART on FHIR&#34;).</p><p>Together, these two standards contain everything developers need to build applications that will work anywhere within the healthcare ecosystem:</p><ol start="1"><li><strong>Open standards</strong> for protocols for authentication, authorization, and UI integration that define how to build applications with universal access to EHRs</li><li><strong>Open-source tools and libraries</strong> for developers that make it easier to use SMART standards during application development. The platform also offers a free sandbox that helps developers test their apps before deployment</li><li><strong>An application gallery</strong> that highlights all of the existing healthcare applications and software that currently uses SMART on FHIR&#39;s platform</li></ol><p>The original idea behind SMART was first introduced in <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0900411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article</a> in the New England Journal of Medicine back in 2009. With the help of federal funding in 2010, SMART developed into the platform it is today, which is currently used by both <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-api-for-fhir-moves-to-general-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Azure</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>.</p><h2 id="How-SMART-Improves-Healthcare-Interoperability-and-Delivery">How SMART Improves Healthcare Interoperability and Delivery</h2><p>SMART improves healthcare interoperability in the same way standard electrical sockets and plugs simplify the process of powering different devices in your home.</p><p>Today, most EHR databases use a proprietary API (their own unique plug and socket configuration). As a result, tech companies have to build a custom connection to each database in order to access medical data. Not only is this costly, but it also hinders the ability of healthcare providers and patients to access their data with the technology that works best for them.</p><p>SMART, on the other hand, provides a standard, universal API for accessing EHRs. Any technology built with SMART works with any EHR database that uses SMART as well. As a result, healthcare technology becomes interchangeable, allowing health systems and patients to access medical data on the applications that best suit their needs, rather than only the ones that work with the EHR database they use.</p><h2 id="How-Improved-Interoperability-Improves-The-Value-of-Healthcare-Technology">How Improved Interoperability Improves The Value of Healthcare Technology</h2><p>Interoperability is valuable for healthcare tech companies because it &#34;ensures [their] innovations can be broadly understood and developed,&#34; as Dave Pickles, Founder and CTO of The Trade Desk, tells <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/08/interoperability-and-the-future-of-software-development/?sh=2b59504d4767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forbes</a>. And since SMART improves interoperability, it also encourages healthcare technology innovation.</p><p>For example, SMART decouples the protocols for accessing EHRs from a piece of software itself. So it allows healthcare technology companies to improve their products and services without worrying about how it will impact the way patients and providers access their data. The result is faster development of healthcare applications, which improves the quality of the entire marketplace (and care for consumers) as a whole.</p><p>SMART also simplifies app development for tech companies. Developers no longer need to build custom connections to each EHR database — they can develop their apps once using SMART, and those apps will work with any EHR databases built with SMART. As a result, their apps become more useful to a broader audience of health organizations and consumers.</p><h2 id="What-SMART-s-Inclusion-in-the-21st-Century-Cures-Act-Means">What SMART&#39;s Inclusion in the 21st Century Cures Act Means</h2><p>The 21st Century Cures Act (passed in 2016) called for the adoption of a universal API that would &#34;allow individuals to securely and easily access structured electronic health information using smartphone applications.&#34; The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology’s (ONC’s) <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/curesrule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Rule on Interoperability</a> (published in 2020) later named SMART as that universal API.</p><p>For <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/topic/certification-ehrs/about-onc-health-it-certification-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ONC-certified health IT</a> (primarily government applications), this means SMART&#39;s API is now a requirement. However, since the ONC certification program is voluntary for the private sector, SMART&#39;s API isn&#39;t legally required for companies whose technologies are not used in government applications.</p><p>The Centers For Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) also includes policies in their regulations “which require or encourage payers to implement Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to improve the electronic exchange of health care data.” SMART on FHIR is <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Interoperability/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">named as the preferred technical standard</a> for doing so, meaning any health system that accepts Medicare or Medicaid must also adopt SMART.</p><h2 id="SMART-on-FHIR-is-a-Must-For-Healthcare-Providers">SMART on FHIR is a Must For Healthcare Providers</h2><p>Given the benefits, as well as its inclusion in the Cures Act, adopting SMART is practically a necessity for any health system. For this reason, major EHR players like <a href="https://smarthealthit.org/an-app-platform-for-healthcare/who-is-using-smart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epic, Cerner, and Allscripts</a> are already using SMART.</p><p>However, there are only 58 apps listed on <a href="https://apps.smarthealthit.org/apps/featured" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SMART&#39;s App Gallery</a> as of the writing of this article, meaning few companies have incorporated the standard into their tech at this time. As a result, SMART adoption could be a sales advantage for some tech companies.</p><p>Outside of mandates, early adoption of SMART could also help healthcare tech companies ensure their applications become more widely adopted in the long run.

      <title>Testing AWS Chalice Applications</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/testing-aws-chalice-applications/</link>
      <description>A tutorial to learn how to write unit tests and integration tests for REST APIs in AWS Chalice. Additionally, we will see how to measure test coverage.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> In this tutorial, we will learn how to write unit tests and integration tests with Pytest in AWS Chalice applications. We will also learn how to measure test coverage.</p><h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><p><a href="https://aws.github.io/chalice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS Chalice</a> is a Python-based web micro-framework that leverages on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS Lambda</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">API Gateway</a> services. It is used to create serverless applications. The Chalice experience is <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flask</a>-like by way of features like semantics and syntax. For more details on creating and deploying Chalice applications, you can go through the article on <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-create-crud-rest-api-with-aws-chalice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to create CRUD REST API with AWS Chalice</a>.</p><p>When building applications, there is a need to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">test</a> the code to avoid shipping bugs and unstable code. It also saves one a lot of debugging hours and makes deployments less stressful.</p><p>Common forms of tests in software development include:</p><ol start="1"><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unit test</a>: This tests a particular function, component, or logic in the code. This way, edge cases can easily be identified, isolated, and fixed. Unit tests usually involve inspecting the output of a function against a known or expected output.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_testing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Integration Test</a>: examines multiple parts or the entire application in an end-to-end manner. It considers how each function or component works with the other.</li></ol><p>However, Chalice currently provides a test client for just unit tests. Therefore, the integration tests are written in a manner similar to unit tests with no major difference other than the fact that integration tests consist of multiple unit tests.</p><h2 id="Where-to-Write-Tests">Where to Write Tests</h2><p>In Python-based applications, tests are usually housed in <code>test<span>.</span>py</code> files. These are the test files that will import the application logic to be tested.</p><p>Let&#39;s assume we have a simple Chalice application with a folder structure that looks like the following:</p><pre><code>├── app.py
├── .chalice
├── requirements.txt
└── test.py</code></pre><p>However, as the application becomes bigger, a single <code>test<span>.</span>py</code> file would become bulky and can become difficult to work with. Hence, it is necessary to create a folder of tests called <code>tests</code> and then split the tests into multiple test files inside the test folder.</p><p>Now, we&#39;ll need to create a new folder called <code>tests</code> and an empty <code>__init__<span>.</span>py</code> file inside the folder. The <code>__init__<span>.</span>py</code> will allow Python to recognize the test directory as a package that could be run:</p><pre><code><span>mkdir</span> tests <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> tests
<span>touch</span> __init__.py</code></pre><p>Now, let&#39;s create a test file for our application inside the test folder:</p><pre><code><span>touch</span> test_unit.py</code></pre><p>Then, the folder structure will look like this:</p><pre><code>├── app.py
├── .chalice
├── requirements.txt
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_unit.py</code></pre><p>We can then create as many test files as we need in the <code>tests</code> folder.</p><h2 id="How-to-Do-Unit-Tests">How to Do Unit Tests</h2><p>Since the release of v.1.17.0, AWS Chalice has shipped with a test client that serves as a test runner to write tests in Chalice applications. We no longer need to set up boilerplates and logic for testing. We only need to import the test client into our test file.</p><p>Let&#39;s assume we have our Chalice application has an <code>app<span>.</span>py</code> file that looks like the following:</p><pre><code><span>from</span> chalice <span>import</span> Chalice

app <span>=</span> Chalice<span>(</span>app_name<span>=</span><span>&#39;chalice-api-sample&#39;</span><span>)</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>{</span><span>&#39;hello&#39;</span><span>:</span> <span>&#39;world&#39;</span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>Now, we&#39;ll modify the <code>test_unit<span>.</span>py</code> file as follows:</p><pre><code><span>import</span> app
<span>from</span> chalice<span>.</span>test <span>import</span> Client</code></pre><p>In the above code, we have just imported the <code>app<span>.</span>py</code> and the chalice test Client. Let&#39;s add the following test code:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>

<span>def</span> <span>test_index</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>with</span> Client<span>(</span>app<span>.</span>app<span>)</span> <span>as</span> client<span>:</span>
        response <span>=</span> client<span>.</span>http<span>.</span>get<span>(</span><span>&#39;/&#39;</span><span>)</span>

That implies that whenever we run the test, a test environment with resources and environment variables will be set up and then cleaned up after running the test.</li><li>We made a <code><span>GET</span></code> request via HTTP using the <code>client<span>.</span>http</code> attribute.</li><li>We assert that a <code><span>200</span></code> status code is returned in the response with a JSON response body—<code><span>{</span><span>&#39;hello&#39;</span><span>:</span> <span>&#39;world&#39;</span><span>}</span></code>.</li></ol><p>We will install <a href="https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/getting-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pytest</a> runner to run our test:</p><pre><code>pip <span>install</span> pytest</code></pre><p>Then, we will run with the following command:</p><pre><code>py.test tests/test_unit.py</code></pre><p>We should get a response that looks like the following:</p><pre><code><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span> <span>test</span> session starts <span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span>

We will test a request from our app to an endpoint of <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JSONPlaceholder</a> API data service to get a list of dummy posts. Firstly, let us install the Python requests module:</p><pre><code>pip <span>install</span> requests</code></pre><p>Then, let&#39;s add a function inside <code>app<span>.</span>py</code> file to make a <code><span>GET</span></code> request to the <code><span>/</span>post</code> endpoint of JSONPlaceholder and return a list of posts:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>import</span> requests

        <span>return</span> <span>None</span>
<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span></code></pre><p>In the above code, we wrote a function called <code>get_post</code> that makes an HTTP request to the DummyAPI server and returns the response of the request in JSON form.</p><p>So, we&#39;ll add a mock inside the <code>test_unit<span>.</span>py</code> file:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>

    response <span>=</span> app<span>.</span>get_post<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>assert</span> response<span>.</span>ok</code></pre><p>In the above code, we imported the patch function of the mock module. Then, we defined the patch function as a decorator with reference to the project&#39;s <code>request<span>.</span>get</code>. Then, we created a function called <code>test_get_post</code> with a parameter called <code>mock_get</code> to test the <code>get_post</code> function inside the <code>app<span>.</span>py</code> file. If the returned status of <code>mock_get</code> is <code>ok</code>, then a fake request to the JSONPlaceholder is made, after which an assertion of the status code of the response to the request is made. We ensured that the mock acts like it is making a real <code>request<span>.</span>get</code> request to the JSONPlaceholder server, whereas it is a fake request. This allows us to test our code without dependence on the JSONPlaceholder external API server. </p><p>If we run our test again with the following bash command:</p><pre><code>py.test tests/test_unit.py</code></pre><p>We should get an output similar to the following:</p><pre><code><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>=</span> <span>test</span> session starts <span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>=</span>

To accommodate situations when no post is returned when we request for a post from JSONPlaceholder. Therefore, we will add a test that will check when no post is returned.

    <span>assert</span> response <span>==</span> <span>None</span></code></pre><p>In the above file, we asked the test to check if the returned value of the mock <code><span>GET</span></code> request is not <code>ok</code> in the line <code>mock_get<span>.</span>return_value<span>.</span>ok <span>=</span> False</code>. We also asserted that a <code>None</code> response is returned. So, we have been able to handle situations where a post is not returned.</p><p>We can then run the <code>test_unit<span>.</span>py</code> file again as thus:</p><pre><code>py.test tests/test_unit.py</code></pre><p>We will get the following output:</p><pre><code><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>=</span> <span>test</span> session starts <span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>==</span><span>=</span>

These tests are usually written like unit tests, but they involve verifying multiple parts of the application at once. An integration test might require establishing a network connection, setting up a database, etc. These can be configured as fixtures. Fixtures are functions that set up the initial states/environment that you can create in your tests once and use multiple times.</p><p>It is a good habit to separate unit tests from integration tests by putting them in separate folders. Hence, we will create two folders inside the <code>test</code> directory and call them <code>unit</code> and <code>integration</code>, respectively. Then,</p><ul><li>we will move the <code>test_unit<span>.</span>py</code> file into the <code>unit</code> folder.</li><li>also, we will create a new <code>test_integration<span>.</span>py</code> file in the <code>integration</code> folder</li><li>next, we will create a <code>conftest<span>.</span>py</code> file in the <code>test</code> folder to house our fixtures.</li></ul><p>So, the folder structure will look like the following:</p><pre><code>├── app.py
├── .chalice
├── requirements.txt
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── conftest.py
    ├── unit/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── test_unit.py
    │
    └── integration/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── test_integration.py</code></pre><p>To start with, we will create a fixture called <code>app</code>. This fixture will be the instance of our Chalice application. Let&#39;s go to the <code>conftest<span>.</span>py</code> file and change it thus:</p><pre><code><span>import</span> pytest
<span>from</span> chalice <span>import</span> Chalice
<span>import</span> app <span>as</span> chalice_app
<span>from</span> chalice<span>.</span>test <span>import</span> Client


<span>@pytest<span>.</span>fixture</span>

        <span>yield</span> client</code></pre><p>In the code above, we&#39;ve abstracted an instance of our Chalice application as a fixture. We also created a fixture for our test client.</p><p>Going forward, let&#39;s assume that we have set up a REST API for a bookshelf application in the <code>app<span>.</span>py</code> with CRUD endpoints like the following:</p><pre><code><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>

      <title>State Pattern in Python</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/state-pattern-in-python/</link>
      <description>Learn to implement state pattern and finite state machines using Python.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Design patterns</a> are conventional solutions to common challenges in software development using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Object-oriented programming</a>. One of the famous design patterns for developing scalable and flexible software is the state pattern. You&#39;ll learn about the state pattern and how to apply it to improve your software project in this article.</p><h2 id="Finite-State-Machine">Finite State Machine</h2><p>Let&#39;s define a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finite state machine</a> (FSM) before moving on to the state design pattern. It is well known that the concepts of state patterns and finite-state machines have a close relationship. An FSM is something that behaves differently depending on its internal state. In computer programming, the behavior of an object in an application varies depending on its state. A switch and a lightbulb are simple examples of FSM. &#34;ON&#34; and &#34;OFF&#34; are the two possible states of the light bulb. To change the state of the bulb &#39;ON&#39; or &#39;OFF&#39;, simply flip the switch. Transition is the process of moving from one state to another. Transition is affected by several factors. In the case of the light bulb, it is dependent on the input from the switch. The state diagram, which is shown below, graphically depicts the states and transitions.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/6Y4Ljm8KBa45GF54np9a8i/b5bff5c1cf9b5a8ead644a110f9db059/01_bulb_state_diagram.png" alt="light bulb state diagram"/></p><p>We can implement the state machine using any programming language. Depending on a few factors, our code behaves differently. You can implement the preceding light bulb example as follows:</p><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>LightBulb</span><span>:</span>
  _state <span>=</span> <span>&#39;OFF&#39;</span>    <span># initial state of bulb</span>
  
  <span>def</span> <span>onOff</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> switch<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> switch <span>==</span> <span>&#39;ON&#39;</span><span>:</span>
        self<span>.</span>_state <span>=</span> <span>&#39;ON&#39;</span>
    <span>elif</span> switch <span>==</span> <span>&#39;OFF&#39;</span><span>:</span>
        self<span>.</span>_state <span>=</span> <span>&#39;OFF&#39;</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>continue</span>          <span># if we get wrong input</span></code></pre><p>For small systems, such as the one described above, the code appears to be straightforward and simple. However, if there are many states and transitions, our code will get flabby with conditional statements. The code becomes more extensive, and it won&#39;t be easy to maintain the application. If you want to add additional states or transitions to the program, you&#39;ll have to change the entire code base. You can use the <strong>State Design Pattern</strong> in these cases.</p><h2 id="State-Pattern">State Pattern</h2><p>It is a behavioral design pattern. You can use the state pattern to implement state-specific behavior in which objects can change their functionality at runtime. You can use it to avoid using conditional statements when changing an object&#39;s behavior based on its state. In the state pattern, you should <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">encapsulate</a>) different states in separate <code>State</code> classes. The original class keeps a reference to a state object based on its current state rather than using conditional statements to implement state-dependent functionality.</p><h2 id="UML-Diagram">UML Diagram</h2><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/7EXrJIISe60aDo65BUFXgW/caabc74e7fe1d13bc1150ce6baa98edb/02_UML_state_class.png" alt="UML class diagram of state pattern"/></p><p>1) <strong>Context</strong> - it is the original class of our application. It maintains a reference to one of the concrete states on which its behavior depends. It also has a method to modify the internal state.</p><p>2) <strong>State interface</strong> - All supported states share the same state interface. Only the state interface allows <em>Context</em> to communicate with state objects. <em>Context</em> can only communicate with state objects via the state interface.</p><p>3) <strong>Concrete states</strong> - For each state, these objects implement the &#39;State&#39; interface. These are the main objects which contain the state-specific methods.</p><h2 id="How-does-it-work-">How does it work?</h2><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/9jQ2UH5r4b4amneAHwIxG/fa3b9affd7c467bc6513b64cd1362114/03_UML_state_sequence.png" alt="UML sequence diagram of state pattern"/></p><p>Assume the <em>Context</em> is configured with an initial state, <code>concreteStateA</code>.  It behaves according to its initial state. The <em>Context</em> now implements the <code>doSomething</code> method according to <code>concreteStateA</code>. The concrete states should contain a back reference to call back and change <em>Context&#39;s</em> current state object. If a state transition occurs, the <em>Context&#39;s</em> <code>setSate</code> method is invoked, referencing the new state, <code>concreteStateB</code>. The <em>Context</em> changed its internal state and behavior. Now, it uses the <code>concreteStateB</code> to implement the <code>doSomething</code> method. The basic idea is that the states can change the context&#39;s state automatically. As a developer, you can modify the states by using any number of instances of <code>setState</code>.</p><p>If you want to add another state, simply create a new concrete state object without changing the <em>Context</em> of the application.</p><h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2><p>Let&#39;s take a step-by-step look at implementing the state pattern.</p><p>1) Find an existing class that contains state-dependent code, or create a suitable context class.

Try using the state pattern to implement the light bulb example from the Finite state machine.</p><h2 id="Advantages-and-Disadvantages">Advantages and Disadvantages</h2><p>The state pattern, like any other programming concept, has a number of benefits as well as some drawbacks. You can avoid writing massive conditional blocks for switching between states by using the state pattern instead of hard-coding state-specific behavior. It allows you to develop a flexible and maintainable application. You can add new states and transitions to the <em>Context</em> without changing it.</p><p>It&#39;s a good idea to use the state pattern if the logic of each state is complex and the states change frequently. Otherwise, it complicates simple things by bringing a plethora of classes and objects. The state pattern adds another level of indirection by imposing clients to rely on a State object, and it extends the context class to allow State objects to change the state of the <em>Context</em>.</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, you learned how to use the state pattern in Python programming to design state machines. Without using larger conditional blocks to implement state-specific behavior, the state pattern makes the development process a lot easier. You can also add new states that are not dependent on other states, giving your application more flexibility. The state pattern is very similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategy pattern</a>, which alters strategies based on user choices. The main distinction is that concrete states are aware of other states, whereas the strategies do not. Why do we say that states are aware of other states? because each state has to know to which state they should move. For example, the first-floor state knows that they should change to the second-floor state. Another important difference with strategy pattern is that in the case of Strategy pattern, it&#39;s the client, which provides a different strategy to Context, on State pattern, the state transition is managed by Context or State itself. Try to make use of the state pattern in your software to make the development process go more smoothly.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>TinyGo: Good Things Come in Small Packages</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/tinygo-good-things-come-in-small-packages/</link>
      <description>A beginners guide into the world of IoT with TinyGo.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> The concept of coding for IoT devices, CLIs and WebAssembly is not a new concept. However, what if I told you that it is possible to use Golang for all three. <a href="https://tinygo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TinyGo</a> is a specialized project specifically designed and used for development in small places. This article explains the benefits of TinyGo, what it is, and how you can use it. It also provides you with a Golang IoT code example for you to see TinyGo in action.</p><h2 id="What-Is-TinyGo-">What Is TinyGo?</h2><p>TinyGo is Golang&#39;s baby brother. It is a compiler that allows a user to write the Golang code they are familiar with and run it in places people wouldn&#39;t have thought were possible. What this means is that the barriers to entry into some tech spaces are being gradually lowered. I say this because I am writing through experience.</p><h2 id="How-Is-TinyGo-Different-from-Golang-">How Is TinyGo Different from Golang?</h2><p>Out of the box, Golang is a feature-rich, highly-performant, compiled language, which means that Golang is compiled to machine-readable code (those funky <code><span>1</span></code> &#39;s and <code><span>0</span></code> &#39;s everyone talks about).</p><p>In turn, being compiled to machine code allows it to run directly on the hardware — all that CPU/RAM power! Another really cool feature of Golang is that when building a binary of the written program, it includes extensive cross-compatibility for a wide from of different system architectures.</p><p>Once a binary has been built, it can be run on any compatible distribution/architecture, providing it has been specified during the build process. To find the list of supported architectures (after installing Go on your machine), run this command into your terminal: <code>go tool dist list</code>.</p><p>The output will look something like this:</p><pre><code>aix/ppc64
android/386
android/amd64
android/arm
android/arm64
darwin/amd64
darwin/arm64
dragonfly/amd64
freebsd/386
<span>..</span>.</code></pre><p>So, how is TinyGo different? Well, it&#39;s the same Golang you know and love, but TinyGo is a smaller compiler based on <a href="https://llvm.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LLVM</a> technologies. It has essentially cherry-picked a number of important and available libraries and trimmed a lot of the fat from the core language.</p><p>By doing that, TinyGo becomes an even more powerful and efficient language that you can run in unexpected places. As an example of fat that&#39;s been trimmed, the library <code>html<span>/</span>template</code> cannot be imported by TinyGo as it relies upon other dependencies, which in turn are not able to be imported.</p><blockquote><p>To read up on the packages supported by TinyGo, visit the <a href="https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/lang-support/stdlib/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documentation pages</a>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Where-Can-You-Use-TinyGo-">Where Can You Use TinyGo?</h2><h3 id="Use-TinyGo-with-WebAssembly">Use TinyGo with WebAssembly</h3><h4 id="What-is-WebAssembly-">What is WebAssembly?</h4><p>Web development might usually be associated with JavaScript, but this isn&#39;t always the case. WebAssembly is an official W3C standard and allows people to develop applications for the web without using JavaScript.</p><p>I first must stress, WebAssembly is not a replacement for JavaScript but can be an excellent complement. The two technologies can work well together to deliver web content. In one small sentence, WebAssembly is a format for writing code for the web. WebAssembly is designed to be highly performant, which is why a language with a small overhead is preferable.</p><p>WebAssembly allows developers to write code in a familiar language and run it through a web browser for end-users. Through this method, near-native performance is achieved, and the required support is already in your modern browser.</p><p>In essence, you can write your code in TinyGo and pass it through the WASM compiler, which turns that Golang code into machine-readable code. Then, you can run the application through a web browser easily.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/A4oW5u3cr5j5St4Z1bA0o/7714e2411c109a2e74347557be305cc1/01_tiny.png" alt="WebAssembly diagram"/></p><h3 id="Use-TinyGo-to-build-a-CLI">Use TinyGo to build a CLI</h3><h4 id="What-is-a-CLI-">What is a CLI?</h4><p>A Command Line Interface (CLI) is a standardized way for a user to interact textually with a system or application. The first primary use cases of CLIs were back in the 1960&#39;s where users could use a terminal to interact with the operating system. This was a continuous trend throughout the following decades which enabled systems to become more complex and give users more freedom on the computer they are using.</p><h4 id="Why-does-a-CLI-need-to-be-small-">Why does a CLI need to be small?</h4><p>Some CLIs interact with the operating system directly, which in turn means they will need some low-level permissions and a secure library set. Initially, people might think of a C language or Python to accomplish that task. They are established, low-level languages that have been used in some high-profile CLIs in the past.</p><p><em>Golang enters the room</em>.</p><p>However, for those that don&#39;t know, Go is derived from C. In fact, it&#39;s so close that you can call C code from within a Go program — it&#39;s called Cgo.</p><p>In recent years, Go has been the go-to language to create CLIs. Some of the most popular and most used CLIs are written in Go: Docker CLI, Kubernetes CLI (<code>kubectl</code>), GitHub CLI, just to name a few. This has been made possible by the creation of third-party libraries and imports that take care of the complex tasks developers would otherwise have to take care of themselves. </p><p>Second to this is the power hidden under the hood of the language. Go has concurrency in the form of go-routines making asynchronous programming simplistic and a garbage collector helping with memory management. All of these features (and more) help reduce the size and space taken up by an integral program, all working towards keeping programs as performant as possible.</p><p>However, if a small project needs a CLI to be written for it or the CLI is only performing some basic tasks, sometimes these large libraries and imports can be overkill. Unless the end goal is to write a complex, multi-functional CLI like the ones mentioned before, a great number of the available libraries may not even be used, resulting in overhead the project could do without. To keep a CLI small and precise, reducing waste is a top priority. This makes TinyGo a great choice for small CLIs.</p><h3 id="TinyGo-can-power-microcontrollers">TinyGo can power microcontrollers</h3><h4 id="What-is-a-microcontroller-">What is a microcontroller?</h4><p>A microcontroller is usually a single chip on a small circuit board that allows input and output (I/O). A common and well-known example is an Arduino, which is fantastic for home automation and other smaller projects around the house.</p><p>With the IoT boom in recent years, Arduinos have also seen a rise in popularity. The trouble with this is that Arduinos are usually coded in C++. To some, this can be seen as a barrier to entry as it is a complex language, and not everyone wants to learn or use it when alternatives are available.</p><p>When I began to play with IoT, I purchased a bunch of Arduinos, thinking I could do some cool projects. Then I was personally struck with the C++ barrier. Most of my work is either in Node.js or Golang. With this being the case, I took a seat and thought about how I could write the code I know and love to create these cool projects I had in mind. This is where I came across TinyGo.</p><h4 id="How-many-boards-does-TinyGo-support-">How many boards does TinyGo support?</h4><p>TinyGo is a growing project. At the time of writing, TinyGo supports over 60 microcontroller boards. These range from <a href="https://www.espressif.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Espressif boards (ESP&#39;s)</a> to <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/category/851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adafruits</a> and as previously mentioned, Arduinos, opening so many doors for people to begin their journey into IoT whilst coding in a familiar language.</p><blockquote><p>Check the <a href="https://tinygo.org/docs/reference/microcontrollers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">documentation for each microcontroller board supported by TinyGo</a> for more details.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Why-Is-TinyGo-a-Great-Alternative-to-C---and-MicroPython-">Why Is TinyGo a Great Alternative to C++ and MicroPython?</h2><p>I am not going to the language bash. C, Python, and Go are all great languages in their own way. With that being said, there is plenty of room for this project to grow and come to fruition with the right support.</p><p>Golang has significantly grown in popularity over the past few years. It is quickly becoming the de facto choice of language for cloud-native development due to its &#34;first-class&#34; support. In the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#most-popular-technologies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2017 for Most popular technologies</a>, Go entered the list for the first time and only scored 4.4%. In contrast to 2020, only 3 years later, it scored <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages-all-respondents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.8%</a>. Let&#39;s the couple that with Golang being associated with some of the most sought-after skills and top paying salaries worldwide. It is only right to assume this growth will continue.</p><p>In addition, looking at the IoT market, we can see yet another upwards trend. In 2017, Garner forecasted 8.4 billion IoT devices to be connected. Fast-track to 2025, and there is a prediction of up to 30 billion devices being connected. This is a huge leap!

      <title>Best Practices for Flask API Development</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/best-practices-for-flask-api-development/</link>
      <description>Learn how to design and build REST APIs with Python and Flask following best practices.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Python is my favorite programming language. Its adaptability, readability, and coding speed are unique and make <a href="https://livecodestream.dev/post/what-is-python-best-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">python a powerful choice in various projects</a>, from data science projects to scripting and, of course, APIs.</p><p>Python is a popular choice for API development, not only because it is one of the <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most loved programming languages</a>, but also because of its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks that serve that goal, libraries with immense popularity such as <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Django</a>, <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flask</a>, and <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FastAPI</a>.</p><p>But which framework should you use to build your APIs with Python? It’s 100% up to you, but there are important considerations to keep in mind. After all, some of these frameworks are different, even from the ideology.</p><ul><li>Django is an all-inclusive framework. It provides tools and modules for handling API requests, serialization, database connections, automatic admin UI generation, and so much more.</li><li>Flask, on the contrary, is a minimalist framework, it provides only the necessary tools, but it extends its functionality with additional libraries and frameworks. The great part is, you decide exactly what you need for your project, nothing more.</li><li>FastAPI is a relatively new framework. It makes use of newer python features such as type-hints, concurrency handling (with async), and it’s super fast.</li></ul><p>I work a lot with Flask and FastAPI, and I love both. I love the flexibility and adaptability of these frameworks, and for today&#39;s article, we will be focusing on Flask.</p><p>The following tips and practices are the result of research and more than eight years of experience building and shipping production-grade APIs with Python:</p><ul><li>Design your API endpoints with proper names and HTTP verbs</li><li>How to properly structure your application</li><li>Build your documentation from the code</li><li>Testing</li></ul><p><strong>Let’s get started!</strong> 🚀</p><h2 id="Design-Your-API-Endpoints-with-Proper-Names-and-HTTP-Verbs">Design Your API Endpoints with Proper Names and HTTP Verbs</h2><p>An adequately designed API is easy and straightforward for developers to understand. By reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">URI</a> and HTTP verb (more on this later), a developer can pretty much have a good understanding of what to expect to happen when calling a particular method.</p><p>But how does that work? Let’s start with naming URIs. In REST, we called <code>Resource</code> to a first-level data representation. Naming these resources <strong>consistently</strong> throughout your API will turn out to be one of the best decisions for the long term.</p><p>Note that I highlighted consistently in the previous sentence, as it’s a key factor. Sure, there are particular ways to name your resources, and we will cover them, but being consistent is more important to the actual convention you choose.</p><p>Let’s start getting practical by modeling a simple eCommerce website with customers, orders, and a checkout process.</p><p>Our primary resource is <code>customers</code>, which is a collection of the instance <code>customer</code>. With this information, we can identify the collection resource by the URI <code><span>/</span>customers</code> or a single resource by using the URI <code><span>/</span>customers<span>/</span><span>{</span>customerId<span>}</span></code>. Subsequently, we can identify sub-resources such as <code>orders</code>, and we can identify them as <code><span>/</span>customers<span>/</span><span>{</span>customerId<span>}</span><span>/</span>orders</code>, or a single order resource by <code><span>/</span>customers<span>/</span><span>{</span>customerId<span>}</span><span>/</span>orders<span>/</span><span>{</span>orderId<span>}</span></code>.</p><h3 id="Best-practices-naming-resources">Best practices naming resources</h3><ol start="1"><li>Use nouns in their plural form to represent resources, eg:
 <ul><li>✅ Users of a system: <code><span>/</span>users</code>, <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span></code></li><li>✅ User’s playlists: <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span>playlists</code>, <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span>playlists<span>/</span><span>{</span>playlistId<span>}</span></code></li></ul></li><li>Use hyphens “-” to separate words and improve redeability
 <ul><li>✅ <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span><span>-</span>mobile<span>-</span>devices</code></li><li>❌ <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span>mobileDevices</code></li><li>❌ <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span>mobile_devices</code></li></ul></li><li>Use forward slashes “/’ to indicate hierarchy
 <ul><li>✅ <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span>mobile<span>-</span>devices</code></li><li>❌ <code><span>/</span>users<span>-</span>mobile<span>-</span>devices<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span></code></li><li>❌ <code><span>/</span>users<span>-</span>mobile<span>-</span>devices<span>/</span><span>?</span>userId<span>=</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span></code></li></ul></li><li>Use only lowercase letters in URIs
 <ul><li>✅ <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span>mobile<span>-</span>devices</code></li><li>❌ <code><span>/</span>Users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span>Mobile<span>-</span>Devices</code></li></ul></li></ol><p>Now that we understand how to name resources, we need to think about actions. There are methods in our APIs that are procedural by nature and are not related to a specific resource, e.g., checkout, run, play, etc.</p><h3 id="Best-practices-naming-actions">Best practices naming actions</h3><ol start="1"><li>Use verbs to represent actions, e.g.:
 <ul><li>✅ Execute a checkout action: <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span>cart<span>/</span>checkout</code></li></ul></li><li>Same as resources, use hyphens, forward slashes, and lowercase letters.</li></ol><p>One crucial point here is to differentiate between CRUD functions and actions, as both are actions. In REST, CRUD operations, such as Create, Read, Update and Delete, are handled through HTTP verbs and not by the URI.</p><h3 id="But-what-are-HTTP-verbs-or-HTTP-request-methods-">But what are HTTP verbs or HTTP request methods?</h3><p>HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate an action to be performed for a resource (sounds familiar?). The list includes several, but we will be focusing on 5:</p><ul><li><strong>GET</strong>: should be for data retrieval.</li><li><strong>POST</strong>: should be used to create a new resource.</li><li><strong>PUT</strong>: should be used to update information about a specific resource.</li><li><strong>DELETE</strong>: should be used to delete a particular resource.</li><li><strong>PATCH</strong>: should be used to update partial information about a particular resource.</li></ul><h3 id="Example-for-our-eCommerce-website">Example for our eCommerce website</h3><ul><li>✅ <strong>GET</strong> <code><span>/</span>users</code>: lists of all users.</li><li>✅ <strong>POST</strong> <code><span>/</span>users</code>: creates a new user.</li><li>✅ <strong>PUT</strong> <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span></code>: updates a user.</li><li>✅ <strong>DELETE</strong> <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span></code>: deletes a specific user.</li><li>✅ <strong>PATCH</strong> <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span></code>: partially updates a user.</li><li>✅ <strong>GET</strong> <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span>orders</code>: lists of all orders for a particular user.</li><li>✅ <strong>POST</strong> <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span>cart<span>/</span>checkout</code>: runs the checkout process.</li></ul><p>What you shouldn&#39;t do:</p><ul><li>❌ <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span>get<span>-</span>all</code></li><li>❌ <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span>create</code></li><li>❌ <code><span>/</span>users<span>/</span><span>{</span>userId<span>}</span><span>/</span>list<span>-</span>orders</code></li></ul><p>In any form of GET, POST, or another verb.</p><h2 id="How-to-Properly-Structure-Your-Application">How to Properly Structure Your Application</h2><p>I’d like to start this section by saying that there’s no one correct way to structure your application depending on application size, modules, requirements, or even personal preferences. This could vary. However, I’d like to introduce you to how my team structures Flask applications, and we used this setup for multiple production projects.</p><p>You can follow the explanation of the structure in the article, and you can also find this structure ready to use in the <a href="https://github.com/bajcmartinez/flask-api-starter-kit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flask API starter kit on github</a>.</p><pre><code>project/
    api/
        model/
            __init__.py
            welcome.py
        route/
            home.py
        schema/
            __init__.py
            welcome.py
        service
            __init__.py
            welcome.py

    test/
        route/
            __init__.py
            test_home.py
        __init.py

    .gitignore
    app.py
    Pipfile
    Pipfile.lock</code></pre><p>Let’s now break it down and explain each module.</p><p>All the application magic happens inside the API module (<code><span>/</span>api</code>), there, we split the code into 4 main parts:</p><ul><li>The <code>models</code> are the data descriptor of our application, in many cases related to the database model. How each model is defined will heavily depend on the library you use to connect to your database.</li><li>The <code>routes</code> are the URIs to our application, where we define our resources and actions.</li><li>The <code>schemas</code> are the definitions for inputs and outputs of our API, what parameters are allowed, what information we will output. They correlate to our resources, but they are not necessarily the same as our models.</li><li>The <code>services</code> are modules that define application logic or interact with other services or the db layer. Routes should be as simple as possible and delegate all logic to the services.</li></ul><p>Each endpoint in Flask can be defined on its own or by groups called <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/blueprints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blueprints</a>. In my case, I like the grouping Blueprints provide, and I use them for each resource. Let’s take a look at what an example of our welcome route (<code><span>.</span><span>/</span>api<span>/</span>route<span>/</span>home<span>.</span>py</code>) would look like:</p><pre><code><span>from</span> http <span>import</span> HTTPStatus

In this case, our grouping is pretty basic, but we can do much more with grouping, like defining prefixes, resource folders, and more.</p><p>For example if we would like to have our <code>home</code> blueprint always as a nested route of <code><span>/</span>home<span>-</span>service</code>, we could do:</p><pre><code>home_api <span>=</span> Blueprint<span>(</span><span>&#39;api&#39;</span><span>,</span> __name__<span>,</span> url_prefix<span>=</span><span>&#39;/home-service&#39;</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Next we declare one route, but we split it in 2 parts:</p><pre><code><span>@home_api<span>.</span>route</span><span>(</span><span>&#39;/&#39;</span><span>)</span>

In our example, I’m using <a href="https://flask-marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flask-marshmallow</a> serialization library for its purposes.</p><h2 id="Build-Your-Documentation-from-the-Code">Build Your Documentation from the Code</h2><p>You build your API, you shipped to production, and developers are eager to consume it, but how would they know what endpoints are available and how to use them? The simple answer is by reading the documentation.</p><p>The documentation can be built in 2 ways, you can open up an editor and write it “manually”, or you can use the code to generate your documentation. If you like the idea of automatic documentation, you will love <a href="https://swagger.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swagger</a>.</p><p>Swagger is an open-source specification that allows you to describe each element of your API so that any machine or system can interpret it and interact with it. Thanks to this specification, many tools have been developed to provide rich interfaces to make our documentation dynamic and interactive, but also to provide developers with tools to easily generate these swagger files.</p><p>For Flask, there are multiple libraries for automatic Swagger generation, but my favorite is <a href="https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flasgger</a>. Flassger provides annotations and other tools to generate your documentation, and it also provides a pretty web interface where you can see each endpoint, its inputs, and outputs and even run the endpoints directly from the docs.</p><p>Here is an image of it in action:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/3Dz9nOtHkd2JlQxbcCKKKQ/b65d997f2bf20418a7143279e096940b/swagger_demo.png" alt="Swagger demo page"/></p><p>It’s highly configurable and compatible with our serialization library by using an additional library called <a href="https://apispec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">apispec</a>. It’s all pretty easy to set up, but you can also make use of the <a href="https://github.com/bajcmartinez/flask-api-starter-kit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flask starter kit</a>, and you will have it all done for you.</p><p>But once you have it up and running, where is the information taken for the docs? From 2 places:</p><ul><li><p>Remember our swag_from function annotation? There we can provide detailed information about the inputs and outputs</p><pre><code>  <span>@swag_from</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
      <span>&#39;responses&#39;</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
          HTTPStatus<span>.</span>OK<span>.</span>value<span>:</span> <span>{</span>
              <span>&#39;description&#39;</span><span>:</span> <span>&#39;Welcome to the Flask Starter Kit&#39;</span><span>,</span>
              <span>&#39;schema&#39;</span><span>:</span> WelcomeSchema
          <span>}</span>
      <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></li><li><p>We can also use string literals in functions to provide a description for the endpoint, similar to what we did here:</p><pre><code>  <span>def</span> <span>welcome</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
      <span>&#34;&#34;&#34;
      1 liner about the route
      A more detailed description of the endpoint
      ---
      &#34;&#34;&#34;</span></code></pre></li></ul><p>There are many more options and customizations; it’s all well documented on their <a href="https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official docs</a>.</p><h2 id="Testing">Testing</h2><p>If you are like me, perhaps you hate writing tests, but if you are like me, you know it’s worth it. Testing, when done properly, increases efficiency and quality in the long run. They also reassure developers when making changes, refactoring, or building new features on existing systems.</p><p>Building tests shouldn’t be too hard, and it should happen naturally during development. I struggled a lot with it in the past because I’d always first develop the feature, the endpoint, or the function and then write the tests, just to get it done.</p><p>I’m not saying that approach is wrong, but there’s a better way. TDD, or test-driven development, it’s a concept idea where you write tests first, and just then you write the actual code we want to test.</p><p>How does it work? Let’s suppose we need to write a function that will add 2 numbers and return the result; exciting, right?</p><p>With TDD, our approach would be first to write the tests.</p><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>test_answer</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> sum_two_numbers<span>(</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>)</span> <span>==</span> <span>8</span></code></pre><p>Next, we run the tests, and it fails because our function doesn’t even exist yet. So next, we write our function:</p><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>sum_two_numbers</span><span>(</span>num1<span>,</span> num2<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> num1 <span>*</span> num2</code></pre><p>Next, we rerun our tests, and they still fail. Our assertion fails, but why? It turns out that I made a simple mistake. As clumsy as I am, I put a * instead of a +; this would have been very hard to notice without our tests, but thanks god, we have them.</p><p>We fix our function, and now everything runs perfectly.</p><pre><code><span>def</span> <span>sum_two_numbers</span><span>(</span>num1<span>,</span> num2<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    <span>return</span> num1 <span>+</span> num2</code></pre><p>In the exercise we did, it sounds kind of silly, but with more complex functions and code mistakes happen, and having tests first will help a lot; I say that from experience.</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Best practices can be different for different frameworks, problems to solve, or even people, there’s no one way of doing things right, and that’s something I love about programming. However, having basic principles to rely on when designing and developing APIs can help your team, and other developers consume your API products.</p><p>Being consistent in naming, separating concepts in modules or folders in your project, documenting directly from your code, and properly testing are just examples of things that can make your life easier, more productive, and take you to the next level.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed reading this article!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Introduction to Async Programming in C#</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/introduction-to-async-programming-in-csharp/</link>
      <description>Most languages and frameworks support asynchronous programming. But, what is it exactly? Learn about async programming and how to implement it in C#.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You probably already read about asynchronous programming. <code><span>async</span></code> and <code><span>await</span></code> words are used everywhere, no matter which programming language we choose. Talking about .NET framework, and C# in particular, we have some native functions, classes, and reserved words that we can use to implement asynchronous tasks and workflows in our projects.</p><p>In this article, we will talk about synchronism, parallelism, concurrency, and how to implement asynchronous algorithms in our C# applications.</p><h2 id="Synchronous-and-Asynchronous-Tasks">Synchronous and Asynchronous Tasks</h2><p>As a developer, you surely faced scenarios where certain actions or operations took a considerable amount of time to execute. We regularly have to do long-running tasks such as reading a file, calling an API, or downloading a big file. We could wait for one of these tasks to be finished before executing another task. If that&#39;s the case, we say we are working in a &#34;synchronous&#34; way. By doing this, the whole application gets blocked and stops responding until the whole task is completed, and we can move on to a new one.</p><p>In some cases, we don&#39;t have any alternative. If we have Task1 and Task2 that depend on the result of the first action, we will have to wait until Task1 finishes executing to start Task2. But we could have the scenario where the subsequent tasks (or some of them) don&#39;t depend on the result of the previous long-running task. If that&#39;s the case, we have different strategies and approaches that we could take to make our application faster and in a more performant way.</p><p>For example, we could have an application that runs concurrent tasks internally. There is a button and a task executed when it is clicked. Right after the user clicks on the button, the application can trigger a separate thread to run the requested task. In the meantime, the main thread becomes available to execute other actions while the button&#39;s task is executed in the background. Doing this, we keep the UI responsive in case the user wants to interact with it.</p><p>Another scenario would be needing to run multiple copies of a certain group of actions or instructions. An example of this would be uploading many files at the same time. In this case, our application could trigger one thread per file and execute the necessary code inside of them. Doing this, we would be processing the files in a &#34;parallel&#34; way. In a nutshell, here is the difference between the two concepts: concurrency means the application is making progress on more than one task at the same time, while parallelism is about running multiple tasks simultaneously.</p><p>But let&#39;s say we have to read a big file, call an API, and do some complex calculations. There is no dependency between the three tasks, but we need the result of all of them to continue the execution of our application and update the UI. In this case, we could execute our tasks &#34;asynchronously&#34; with the three ones running simultaneously and wait for their result to do the subsequent tasks.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Asynchronous-Programming-">What Is Asynchronous Programming?</h2><p>We could define asynchronous programming as the way of executing programming code in a thread without having to wait for an I/O-bound or CPU-bound task to finish. I/O-bound operations could be file-system accesses, HTTP requests, API calls, or database queries. And CPU-bound operations would be actions like encrypting data, complex calculations, image or document management.</p><p>One of the ideas of asynchronous programming is to divide our logic into <em>awaitable</em> tasks so that we don&#39;t block the execution of our application. We can call an async method and get a task object that represents it. In the meantime, we can do some not related and not dependant work. After we execute those operations, we await the async task, which may already be finished or not. If the execution is finished, we will get the resulting value from the task and use it in the next dependant operations.</p><h3 id="Benefits">Benefits</h3><p>Some of the benefits we have working with asynchronous tasks are:</p><ul><li>We keep the UI of our app responsive.</li><li>We improve the performance of our application.</li><li>We avoid <a href="https://medium.com/criteo-engineering/net-threadpool-starvation-and-how-queuing-makes-it-worse-512c8d570527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thread pool starvation</a>.</li></ul><h3 id="Drawbacks">Drawbacks</h3><p>Although, there are some drawbacks when working with async programming:</p><ul><li>Code gets more complex and harder to maintain.</li><li>There is increased memory allocation, as some objects have to stay alive longer while awaiting other code to be executed.</li><li>It can get hard to find bugs occurring in asynchronous tasks.</li><li>When we&#39;re writing an asynchronous piece of code, all our application code tends to become asynchronous.</li></ul><h2 id="Asynchronous-Programming-Patterns">Asynchronous Programming Patterns</h2><p>To perform asynchronous operations in .NET, we can follow three different patterns:</p><p><strong>Asynchronous Programming Model (APM)</strong>: Let&#39;s say we have two methods, and we name them <code>BeginOperation</code> and <code>EndOperation</code>. After calling <code>BeginOperation</code>, our application can continue executing tasks on the calling thread while the async task is executed on a different thread. For each call to <code>BeginOperation</code>, our app should also call <code>EndOperation</code> method to get the results. In .NET, it can be implemented using <code>IAsyncResult</code>. Let&#39;s see an example of this model:</p><pre><code><span>using</span> <span>System</span><span>;</span>
<span>using</span> <span>System<span>.</span>IO</span><span>;</span>
<span>using</span> <span>System<span>.</span>Threading</span><span>;</span>
<span>public</span> <span>sealed</span> <span>class</span> <span>Program</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>static</span> <span><span>void</span></span> <span>Main</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>{</span>
        <span><span>var</span></span> buffer <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span><span>byte</span></span><span>[</span><span>100</span><span>]</span><span>;</span>
        <span><span>var</span></span> fs <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>FileStream</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;bigFile.txt&#34;</span><span>,</span> FileMode<span>.</span>Open<span>,</span> FileAccess<span>.</span>Read<span>,</span> FileShare<span>.</span>Read<span>,</span> <span>1024</span><span>,</span> FileOptions<span>.</span>Asynchronous<span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>IAsyncResult</span> result <span>=</span> fs<span>.</span><span>BeginRead</span><span>(</span>buffer<span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> buffer<span>.</span>Length<span>,</span> <span>null</span><span>,</span> <span>null</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        <span>// Do other things...</span>

        <span><span>int</span></span> numBytes <span>=</span> fs<span>.</span><span>EndRead</span><span>(</span>result<span>)</span><span>;</span>
        fs<span>.</span><span>Close</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

        Console<span>.</span><span>WriteLine</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;Read {0}  Bytes:&#34;</span><span>,</span> numBytes<span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p><strong>Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP)</strong>: We start an async method that will trigger a <code>Completed</code> event when the task is completed, making the result available to our application. This would be an example of this model:</p><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>ExampleHandler</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>event</span> <span>EventHandler</span> OnTriggerCompleted<span>;</span>

        Console<span>.</span><span>ReadLine</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p><strong>Task-based Asynchronous Pattern (TAP)</strong>: We have an <code>OperationAsync</code> method that returns a <code>Task</code> object, as in the following example:</p><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ClassName</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>public</span> <span>Task</span> <span>OperationAsync</span><span>(</span><span><span>byte</span> <span>[</span><span>]</span></span> buffer<span>,</span> <span><span>int</span></span> offset<span>,</span> <span><span>int</span></span> count<span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>We can await that method, using <code><span>async</span></code> and <code><span>await</span></code> keywords. We will go deeper into this approach in a while.</p><blockquote><p>Keep in mind that <strong>the APM and EAP approaches are legacy models and they are no longer recommended</strong>. Microsoft recommends using the <em>Task-based Asynchronous Pattern</em> to implement async programming in our applications.</p></blockquote><h2 id="Asynchronous-Programming-in-C-">Asynchronous Programming in C#</h2><p>As we mentioned, async programming in C# can be accomplished by implementing the <em>Task-based Asynchronous Pattern</em>. We will have methods that return a <code>Task</code> or <code>Task<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></code> object. Defining those methods as async operations will enable us to await them and keep using the same execution thread to run other operations that are not linked to the awaited task.</p><p>C# provides us two keywords to handle <code>Task</code> objects in an easier way: <code><span>async</span></code> and <code><span>await</span></code>. Adding the keyword <code><span>async</span></code> to a method signature allows us to use the <code><span>await</span></code> keyword inside the method while instructs the compiler to create a state machine to handle the asynchronicity. On the other hand, the <code><span>await</span></code> keyword is used to pause the execution of a method and asynchronously wait for a <code>Task</code> to finish, while the current thread is sent back to the thread pool instead of keeping it in a blocked state. Everything happens in the background, avoiding us to implement and maintain the complexity of thread management and the state of the calls.</p><p>Let&#39;s analyze this piece of code:</p><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>Task<span>&lt;</span>User<span>&gt;</span></span> <span>GetLoggedUserEmailAsync</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span><span>int</span></span> userId <span>=</span> <span>GetId</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span><span>string</span></span> email <span>=</span> <span>await</span> <span>GetEmailAsync</span><span>(</span>userId<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>User</span> user <span>=</span> <span>GetUserByEmail</span><span>(</span>email<span>)</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> user<span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>async</span> <span>Task<span>&lt;</span><span>string</span><span>&gt;</span></span> <span>GetEmailAsync</span><span>(</span><span><span>int</span></span> userId<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>// Do something</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>An async method should return <code><span>void</span></code>, <code>Task</code>, or <code>Task<span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span></code>, where <code><span>T</span></code> is the return data type that we need. Returning <code><span>void</span></code> is normally used for event handlers. The keyword <code><span>async</span></code> enables us to use the command <code><span>await</span></code> within the method so that we can wait for the asynchronous method processing as expected.</p><p>Notice that the methods end with &#34;Async&#34;. Although it is not mandatory, there is a naming convention that an asynchronous method name should end with the word &#34;Async&#34;. This convention aims to make it clear to the consumer of the functionality that the method won&#39;t complete all of its work synchronously.</p><p>In our previous example, <code><span>GetId</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> is called synchronously. When the execution thread encounters the <code><span>await</span></code> keyword on <code><span>await</span> <span>GetEmailAsync</span><span>(</span>userId<span>)</span></code>, it creates a <code>Task<span>&lt;</span>User<span>&gt;</span></code> that contains the remainder of the <code>GetLoggedUserEmailAsync</code> method. This task is executed asynchronously after the <code>Task<span>&lt;</span>string<span>&gt;</span></code> returned by <code>GetEmailAsync</code>. So, the <code>User</code> object is returned from the <code>Task<span>&lt;</span>User<span>&gt;</span></code> created by the <code><span>await</span></code> keyword.</p><h2 id="Asynchronous-Code-in-Action">Asynchronous Code in Action</h2><p>Let&#39;s see a short example to review the concepts previously explained.

The method that triggers the file reading operation is defined as asynchronous, and it&#39;s the one that starts the asynchronous thread reading the text. While the message &#34;A synchronous message&#34; is printed, the reading of the file continues.

      <title>Secure Software Supply Chain with GitHub Security Features</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/secure-software-supply-chain-with-github-security-features/</link>
      <description>Learn what software supply chain is and how to improve security with GitHub security features.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> 
One of the most critical aspects of modern software delivery is security. In the era of open-source projects, it is challenging and not easy to control every vulnerability and make sure that our solution does not use a package with serious vulnerabilities.  Today&#39;s threat to supply chain security is unpatched software. In this article, we will learn how to improve code security with GitHub security features.</p><h2 id="Security-Role-in-the-Software-Supply-Chain">Security Role in the Software Supply Chain</h2><p>Application implementation nowadays looks slightly different than a few years ago. Open-source software has become a standard. Using open-source libraries in different kinds of projects is something normal nowadays, and we do not have to write every part of our application from scratch.</p><p>When using some open-source code or a library, it is worth not forgetting about security aspects. Industry data suggests that 99 percent of codebases contain open-source code. This is a lot! With this fact, we have to remember about dangers related to vulnerabilities and bugs that can lead to bad consequences. Many examples can be provided where an open-source library was used, but then serious vulnerability was discovered, and in the end, there were problems with keeping security at the right level.</p><p>Before we discuss the role of security in the software supply chain, we have to find out what it is. <strong>Software supply chain</strong> is anything that goes into or affects the source code from development through Continuous Integration and Delivery pipelines until it gets deployed into production and used broadly. Any examples? The software supply chain includes information about who wrote a specific fragment of code, which tools were used to apply security scanning, what is the infrastructure used to host our solution, or what dependencies are used.</p><p>When a solution is being developed, often security part is missed or left as the last step in the whole process of the software supply chain. One of the biggest threats to supply chain security nowadays is unpatched software. This is why we should not include security assessment as the last step of our software supply chain. Security should be an ongoing part of software development to make sure that any potential vulnerabilities can be quickly mitigated.</p><p>Keeping an eye on every security aspect can be challenging, especially for developers who are focused on the code implementation rather than scanning and searching for vulnerabilities. Also, it is important to provide security feedback to developers right away so that any potential vulnerabilities are eliminated as quickly as possible.</p><p>In the following, we will focus on the security features available on GitHub to make sure that our software supply chain is more secure.</p><h2 id="The-Sample-Application">The Sample Application</h2><p>To present some of the security features in action, you can use the sample application that is available on <a href="https://github.com/auth0-blog/Globomantics-Games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this GitHub repository</a>. This repository contains a simple web game written as an ASP .NET Core MVC application in .NET 5. We will not focus on the implementation details in this article. Our goal is to discover and understand different security features available on GitHub and see security scanning in action. With this repository, you can try security features on your own. Use the <a href="https://github.com/auth0-blog/Globomantics-Games/tree/for-security-features-testing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code><span>for</span><span>-</span>security<span>-</span>features<span>-</span>testing</code></a> branch as a starting point by running the following command on your machine:</p><pre><code><span>git</span> clone -b for-security-features-testing https://github.com/auth0-blog/Globomantics-Games.git</code></pre><h2 id="GitHub-Security-Features-to-Keep-Secure-Your-Repository">GitHub Security Features to Keep Secure Your Repository</h2><p>GitHub provides a few built-in tools to keep our source code security at the right level. However, we can also integrate third-party tools. Let&#39;s start by discussing GitHub&#39;s built-in security features first.</p><h3 id="Repository-dependency-graph">Repository dependency graph</h3><p>When using open-source libraries in our project, it is sometimes hard to track all dependencies. Of course, we can open our package managers (like NuGet) and see all the open-source packages added to the project. But what about a deeper knowledge about other packages used by the packages we referenced? Confusing and challenging, right? This is where the GitHub repository dependency graph can be helpful. With a dependency graph, we can recursively track all of the dependencies used in the project. </p><p>We can find the dependency graph by opening our repository&#39;s main page on GitHub, under the <em>Insights</em> tab as in the picture below.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/7s3HZp8ib6ApzkU5U6rJg7/80b3b277a0789dce93b8457d2a2b9b14/github-dependency-graph-example.png" alt="GitHub dependency graph"/></p><p>The dependency graph is enabled by default for each repository hosted on GitHub. It can scan common package manifests like:</p><ul><li><code><span>package</span><span>.</span>json</code></li><li><code>requirements<span>.</span>txt</code></li><li><code>packages<span>.</span>config</code></li><li><code><span>.</span>csproj</code> files</li></ul><h3 id="Automated-dependency-scanning">Automated dependency scanning</h3><p>Once we know what dependencies are used in our project, it would be nice to scan them automatically and detect potential vulnerabilities. This is where automated dependency scanning can help. GitHub provides automated dependency alerts (using <a href="https://dependabot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dependabot</a>) that watch dependency graphs. It cross-references the target versions of your project&#39;s dependencies with the versions on known vulnerability lists aggregated in the <a href="https://github.com/advisories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub Advisory Database</a>.</p><p>When a risk is detected, the project is alerted as presented in the picture below.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/4W7rjQeVo8dH6lH51bfRdn/ea2f3f83ebd48ff46c4af4326ae0e1fb/dependency-scanning-example.png" alt="GitHub dependency scanning"/></p><p>This is not enough. To make it easier for developers, once a vulnerability is detected in one of the libraries used, an automatic pull request is created, which contains the upgraded version of that library.</p><p>We can enable the <em>Dependabot alerts</em> and the <em>Dependabot security updates</em> features accessing the <em>Security &amp; analysis</em> section under the <em>Settings</em> tab on GitHub, as in the picture below:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/bwJP4ppPL73UEvIp1r9cD/b9a3883afba99ca0aa4e225c3fb53d1c/dependabot-alerts-configuration.png" alt="GitHub security updates"/></p><h3 id="Secret-scanning">Secret scanning</h3><p>Storing secrets and credentials in any source code repository is a bad practice. When a push is done to a public repository, GitHub scans the content of the commits for secrets and credentials.</p><p>What is more, GitHub detects known types of secrets from different providers like Adobe, Microsoft Azure, Atlassian, Dropbox, and so on.</p><p>When a secret is detected, the repository owner is alerted. The below picture presents the scanning flow.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/3r4yctOqQmbX9K7TEyfKyS/e0697600af24c0de9c62e62cf2f49edd/secret-scanning-example-flow.png" alt="GitHub secret scanning"/></p><p>[<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/secret-scanning-partner-program#how-secret-scanning-works-in-a-public-repository" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Source: GitHub</em></a>]</p><p>Once a new push with a secret embedded in the source code is done, GitHub applies regex scanning to verify if there is any secret with a known pattern. If a secret is detected, GitHub sends the found secret value to a service provider&#39;s verify endpoint. If verification is successful, the secret is revoked and an email alert is sent to the source code repository owner.</p><p>Secret scanning is available for all public repositories and for private repositories owned by organizations where <em>GitHub Advanced Security</em> is enabled. You can read more about <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/developers/overview/secret-scanning-partner-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the secret scanning partner program here</a>.</p><h3 id="Security-policy">Security policy</h3><p>Automated scanning is helpful, but it is also important to provide a way for other developers and people who use/contribute to our project, in general, to report found vulnerabilities. We can facilitate reporting security issues by providing a <code><span>SECURITY</span><span>.</span>md</code> file in the repository&#39;s <code>root</code>, <code>docs</code>, or <code><span>.</span>github</code> folders. This file provides guidance on how to report vulnerability and contact the repository owner or which versions are supported with security updates. Providing guidance through this file can speed up the resolution of critical issues. When someone creates an issue in our repository, they will see a link to our project&#39;s security policy.</p><p>The following picture shows the document you can find in our sample project:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/37g2XyZ40VmAOoxWCaoSob/ed480113688b023108dcf774e14e9aaa/security-policy-document.png" alt="GitHub security policy"/></p><p>By convention, the <code><span>SECURITY</span><span>.</span>md</code> file lives in the root of our GitHub repository. There is no default template for security policy. However, we should try to put at least our contact information and explain how reported security issues can be verified. The security policy file is part of <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">default community health files</a> on GitHub, so it means that we have to name it exactly in this way: <code><span>SECURITY</span><span>.</span>md</code>.</p><h3 id="Automated-code-scanning">Automated code scanning</h3><p>With <a href="https://github.com/features/actions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub Actions</a>, we can enable automated code scanning so that each time a new merge is done, our code will be scanned. With code scanning enabled, we can analyze and find security vulnerabilities and errors in the code hosted in our GitHub repository.</p><p>GitHub provides a built-in code scanning tool called CodeQL, but we can integrate other third-party tools, of course. Adding code scanning is useful to help prevent developers from introducing any new security problems into the source code. Code scanning can also help improve our code quality.</p><p>At a high level, CodeQL is an analysis engine used by developers to automate security checks, and by security researchers to perform variant analysis. In the following section, we will discover how to enable code scanning with CodeQL and what configuration options are available. To learn more about CodeQL, <a href="https://codeql.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out the official documentation</a>. </p><h2 id="Repository-Code-Scanning-with-CodeQL">Repository Code Scanning with CodeQL</h2><p>When using CodeQL, our source code is treated as data. Security vulnerabilities, bugs, and other errors are modeled as queries that can be executed against databases extracted from source code. There are three main steps in CodeQL analysis:</p><ol start="1"><li><em>Preparation</em>, preparing the code by creating a CodeQL database.</li><li><em>Analysis</em>, running CodeQL queries against the database.</li><li><em>Interpretation</em>, interpreting the query results to check if any vulnerabilities or code bugs were found.</li></ol><p>CodeQL can be used to scan many different languages like C++, C#, Java, or Phyton. We can use multiple queries when CodeQL scanning is done. To make it easier, we can use <a href="https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/creating-codeql-query-suites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">query suites</a>. CodeQL query suites are <code><span>.</span>qls</code> files that allow us to pass multiple queries to CodeQL without having to specify the path to each query file individually.</p><p>In the following, we are going to see how to use the <em>Security and Quality</em> query suite to detect bugs and security issues in the source code.</p><p>To enable CodeQL scanning, we open the <em>Security</em> section and select <em>Code scanning alerts</em>. Then we click the <em>Setup this workflow</em> button within the <em>CodeQL Analysis</em> item.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/2dyxIKUmdQ8IfK0SZlxEST/fc4fd8563df833edb5c862731cb0bd32/codeql-setup.png" alt="GitHub security policy"/></p><p>Now, replace the default code of the workflow with the following.</p><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>&#34;Build and scan project with CodeQL&#34;</span>

Now, let&#39;s discuss its structure.</p><p>First of all, we can decide when to run the scanning. In our case, the scanning is executed once a pull request is created to merge changes into the <code>main</code> branch. In the <code>jobs</code> section, we declare a runner environment specified by <code>runs<span>-</span>on</code>. By specifying the permission within a job definition, you can configure a different set of permissions for the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/authentication-in-a-workflow#about-the-github_token-secret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code><span>GITHUB_TOKEN</span></code></a> for each job, if required. You can read more about job permissions in the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official documentation</a>.</p><p>In the <code>strategy</code> section, we can declare the languages for which scanning should be applied in the project. In our case, we want to scan for the C# language. We declare the languages in the <code>matrix</code> section. With <code>fail<span>-</span>fast</code> set to <code><span>false</span></code>, we avoid breaking the whole workflow if scanning fails for one of the declared languages.</p><p>In the <code>steps</code> section, there are the steps of the full process:</p><ol start="1"><li><em>Checkout repository</em>, to checkout project&#39;s code for scanning.</li><li><em>Initialize CodeQL</em>, to initialize CodeQL scanning for the languages declared in the <code>matrix</code> section. In the <a href="https://github.com/auth0-blog/Globomantics-Games/tree/main/.github/workflows/codeql" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>config<span>-</span>file</code></a> section, we can provide a path to the <code>codeql<span>-</span>config<span>.</span>yml</code> file where we declare the query suites which to use during the scanning. In this case, we use the <code>security<span>-</span>and<span>-</span>quality</code> query suite. The <code>codeql<span>-</span>config<span>.</span>yml</code> file is not mandatory, but it helps to keep the CodeQL scanning script more readable. We can also use this file to disable the default queries and to specify which directories to scan during the analysis.</li><li><em>Autobuild</em>, to build source code.</li><li><em>Perform CodeQL Analysis</em>, to perform the analysis and publish the report.</li></ol><p>Here is the content of the <code>codeql<span>-</span>config<span>.</span>yml</code> file:</p><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>&#34;Security and Quality&#34;</span>

<span>queries</span><span>:</span>
  <span>-</span> <span>name</span><span>:</span> Security and Quality
    <span>uses</span><span>:</span> security<span>-</span>and<span>-</span>quality</code></pre><p>Once the scanning is completed, we can check the report under the <em>Security</em> tab in the <em>Code scanning alerts</em> section:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/4vrcomaZxQHXWWRAxL0evU/bf5028ce02c9da560b855c108f28eca8/codeql-analysis-result-example.png" alt="CodeQL Analysis result"/></p><p>In the report above, we can see a recommendation to check if the variable is null first and then try to access it instead of catching a <code>NullReferenceException</code>. With CodeQL, we can discover many different security issues and get hints on how to improve our code quality and eliminate potential bugs. I recommend learning more about CodeQL analysis by reading the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/secure-coding/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official documentation</a>.</p><h2 id="License-Compliance-Management">License Compliance Management</h2><p>When talking about open-source software, it is important to remember about license compliance. There are many different types of licenses, and we have to carefully verify them before we use an open-source library in one of our projects. The most commonly used open-source licenses are:</p><ul><li>GNU General Public License (GPL)</li><li>The Apache License</li><li>MIT License</li><li>GNU Less General Public License (LGPL)</li></ul><p>For instance, GPL is a copyleft license. Using a copyleft license means that software products containing an open source copyleft license must be released with the same copyleft license. So, if we use a GPL-licensed library in our software, we cannot distribute it with an MIT license, for example.</p><p>MIT is a permissive license. Software licensed under the MIT license can be used and modified without limits —  as long as a copy of the original MIT license and a copyright notice are added to it.</p><p>So, we have to be careful in this case because this can be problematic when we want to commercialize our software product.</p><p>GitHub does not provide a license scanning feature by default. Third-party tools can be used to set up license scanning. For example, <a href="https://snyk.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snyk</a> is one of these third-party tools. With <a href="https://snyk.io/product/open-source-license-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Snyk Open Source License Compliance Management</a>, we can scan our project and verify what licenses are used in the libraries we use.</p><p>Snyk license scanning is available in the paid plan, but a 14 days trial version is also available. Once we sign in to <a href="https://app.snyk.io/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">app.snyk.io</a> using a GitHub account, we can select which project we would like to scan. In our case, let&#39;s continue using Snyk without granting direct permissions to the repository on GitHub. We will see how to connect GitHub to the Snyk API in a while. So, let&#39;s click <em>Continue without permissions</em> as presented below:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/2A2DFxw6sExHnkNarFmWhf/6a976312ba2f07f2ad55de49ad18b73e/snyk-setup-page.png" alt="Snyk setup"/></p><p>In the next section, we provide the URL to our public repository on GitHub. In our case, it is <a href="https://github.com/Daniel-Krzyczkowski/Globomantics-Games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/auth0-blog/Globomantics-Games)</a>. Then, let&#39;s click the <em>Import 1 repository</em> button. Once we are signed in, we can activate the 14 days trial by clicking the <em>Start free trial</em> button. </p><p>At this point, let&#39;s click the gear icon in the right top corner of the Snyk website. From the left bar, we have to switch to <em>Licenses</em>. This is where we can see the list of all available licenses discovered in our project once the Snyk license scanning is applied.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/57l8aP1R9XKBS0omyVJZje/55e437274f187016d4a2b6d227adf2ee/snyk-detected-licenses.png" alt="Snyk license scanning"/></p><p>As we can see in the picture above, we can assign different levels of severity to specific license types (<code>None</code>, <code>Low</code>, <code>Medium</code>, or <code>High</code>). Let&#39;s select the <code>Apache<span>-</span><span>2.0</span></code> license from the list. We can add instructions on what should be exactly verified when this type of license is found in our project. Notice that <em>Severity</em> is set to <code>Medium</code>.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/5PgRmN2iL2QbATBMRD0iN/4ad13bdd82078dc048ad688b95a81c16/apache-license-snyk.png" alt="Apache license in Snyk"/></p><p>Now, to enable Snyk scanning on our code, we need to obtain an access token from Synk and store it under the <em>Secrets</em> section on GitHub. So, let&#39;s click the avatar in the right top corner, and from the list, select <em>Account settings</em>. Under the <em>Auth Token</em> section, let&#39;s click <code>Click to show</code> to display the token. Finally, let&#39;s copy the token so that we can use it in the GitHub Actions workflow responsible for the license scanning.</p><p>Back on GitHub, we click the <em>Secrets</em> tab and select <em>Secrets</em>. We paste the token obtained from Snyk by using  the <em>New repository secret</em> button. Once the secret is saved, it should be displayed on the list.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/DOmT8mdLi0bfEPL06C5ei/3be9cc44abfd0909589e16fc95f49196/snyk-token-secret-on-github.png" alt="Snyk token configuration on GitHub"/></p><p>Now it is time to add the Snyk scanning workflow using GitHub Actions. Under the <code><span>.</span>github<span>/</span>workflows</code> folder (the same where we put <code>codeql<span>-</span>analysis<span>.</span>yml</code> file for CodeQL scanning), we have to place the <a href="https://github.com/auth0-blog/Globomantics-Games/blob/main/.github/workflows/snyk-license-scanning.yml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>snyk<span>-</span>license<span>-</span>scanning<span>.</span>yml</code></a> file with the following content:</p><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> <span>&#34;Build and scan project with Snyk&#34;</span>

        <span>sarif_file</span><span>:</span> snyk.sarif</code></pre><p>Let&#39;s discuss its structure. We want to execute the scanning when a push to the <code>main</code> branch occurs. In the <code>jobs</code> section, we declare a runner environment specified by <code>runs<span>-</span>on</code>. In the <code>steps</code> section, there are a few required steps:</p><ol start="1"><li><em>Checkout repository</em>, to checkout project&#39;s code for scanning.</li><li><em>Setup .NET</em>, which includes restoring dependencies with the <code>dotnet restore</code> command, then <code>dotnet build</code> to build project, and <code>dotnet test</code> to run tests if they exist in the solution.</li><li><em>Run Snyk to check for vulnerabilities</em>, which communicates with the Snyk API to apply the code scanning. Notice that we have to fill <code><span>SNYK_TOKEN</span></code> with the value we put in the <code>Secrets</code> section. There are also a few arguments: 
<ul><li>The <code><span>--</span>sarif<span>-</span>file<span>-</span>output<span>=</span>snyk<span>.</span>sarif</code> argument provides the name of the file which contains the scanning report.</li><li>The <code><span>--</span>file<span>=</span><span>.</span><span>/</span>src<span>/</span>web<span>-</span>game<span>/</span>Globomantics<span>.</span>sln</code> argument provides the path to the project/solution.</li><li>The <code><span>--</span>severity<span>-</span>threshold<span>=</span>medium</code>- parameter is used to report alerts with severity <code>Medium</code> and above.</li></ul></li><li><em>Upload result to GitHub Code Scanning</em>, which is responsible for uploading the scanning result so that we can see it under the <em>Security</em> tab.</li></ol><p>Once we push any changes to the <code>main</code> branch, the scanning will be triggered. Let&#39;s check the scanning report shown below:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/2lM81Cue8ALxnT6u9sFDUs/48b9c563e78651709486ce66c97d5b43/snyk-license-scanning-result.png" alt="License scanning report"/></p><p>As we can see above, the <code>Apache<span>-</span><span>2.0</span></code> license was found in one of the libraries we use: <code>Serilog</code>. Once we click on the alert, we can see the details shown below:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/7MCT0ERLSfTmqB3ztLalum/0a3209ecfbeb15549b351938e2e5b10e/snyk-license-scanning-details.png" alt="License scanning details"/></p><p>We can see that the <code>Serilog</code> library uses <code>Apache<span>-</span><span>2.0</span></code> license, and we included this package in the <code>Globomantics<span>.</span>CloudGame</code> project using the NuGet package manager. The reason why we see this alert is the fact that we set the <code><span>--</span>severity<span>-</span>threshold</code> parameter to <code>Medium</code>. In this case, we will be alerted whenever there is a library used in our project with the license for which we set the severity to <code>Medium</code> in the Snyk configuration.</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we discovered how to enable and use GitHub security features to improve code security and software supply chain.

      <title>What Is LGPD? A Business Guide To Brazil&#39;s Data Protection Law</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-lgpd-a-business-guide-to-brazils-data-protection-law/</link>
      <description>LGPD carries implications for businesses beyond Brazil’s borders. Here’s what execs need to know.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais (LGPD or General Personal Data Protection Law) is Brazil’s data protection and privacy law that is closely modeled on the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. LGPD was passed by the National Congress of Brazil on July 10, 2018, in an effort to unify and enhance 40+ data privacy instruments within the country into a single piece of legislation. LGPD went into effect on September 18, 2020. Like the GDPR, the law impacts global organizations beyond Brazil’s borders.</p><p>The extent to which LGPD applies to your organization will depend on the specific nature of your business, so you should always seek skilled legal counsel to help you navigate compliance requirements. However, if your organization does business in Brazil or collects/processes the data of any individual within Brazil, you should familiarize yourself with LGPD’s requirements (summarized below) to understand what impact these regulations may have on you.</p><div><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M22 11.08V12a10 10 0 11-5.93-9.14"></path><path d="M22 4L12 14.01l-3-3"></path></svg><p><strong>Important Information</strong><br/><b></b></p><p>The following information is not intended as legal advice, and readers should consult with their attorneys about matters of compliance.<br/> </p></div><h2 id="Why-LGPD-Was-Passed">Why LGPD Was Passed</h2><p>LGPD was passed to demonstrate and protect individuals’ right to privacy. Despite Brazil being <a href="https://www.launchwaymedia.com/blog/brazil-latin-americas-technology-leader" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Latin America’s technology leader</a> and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/it-investments-in-brazil-surpass-world-average/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the top 10 tech markets</a> in the world, its data protection laws have failed to keep pace with this technological growth. As a side-effect of that rapid growth, Brazil has experienced a number of recent <a href="https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/brazil-reaches-towards-cybersecurity-maturity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-profile data breaches</a>. LGPD establishes a clear requirement for organizations to implement controls that protect individuals’ personal data, with the end goal of reducing the impact of breaches on individuals.</p><p>In addition to introducing privacy regulations, the LGPD also established a separate national authority, the Autoridade Nacional de Proteção de Dados (ANPD or National Data Protection Authority in English), which is responsible for enforcing the law, including issuing penalties and fines. The creation of the ANPD was originally vetoed by President Jair Bolsonaro but later reinstated via <a href="https://www.mondaq.com/brazil/data-protection/818496/provisional-measure-no-86918-creates-the-brazilian-data-protection-authority-and-amends-several-articles-of-the-brazilian-general-data-protection-law" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">executive order</a> in August of 2020.</p><h2 id="Who-LGPD-Applies-To">Who LGPD Applies To</h2><p>LGPD applies to any organization (or individual) regardless of size, industry, public or private status, or country of residence.</p><p>Any legal entity or natural person processing data collected from persons in Brazil (“data controller”) is subject to LGPD if:</p><ul><li>The data collected/processed is about people in Brazil.</li><li>The processing is carried out <strong>inside Brazil;</strong> or</li><li>The processing is for the purposes of offering and selling goods or services to individuals in Brazil.</li><li>The processing is of personal data collected within Brazil.</li></ul><h3 id="Exceptions">Exceptions</h3><p>There are some limited exceptions to the applicability of LGPD. Exceptions include situations where the data is being collected and/or processed:</p><ul><li>By a natural person for private and non-commercial purposes.</li><li>For journalistic, artistic, or academic purposes, regardless of who does the collecting.</li><li>For the purposes of national security, defense, or public safety.</li><li>For investigating and prosecuting criminal offenses.</li><li>If the personal data originates in other countries and only passes through Brazil without any processing being carried out.</li></ul><h2 id="LGPD-Includes-a-Broad-Definition-of-Personal-Data">LGPD Includes a Broad Definition of Personal Data</h2><p><a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/brazilian-data-protection-law-lgpd-english-translation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LGPD defines</a> personal data broadly as any information that could be used to identify an individual. This includes any information that could be combined with other information to identify an individual. That means information such as email, IP addresses, phone numbers, geolocation, and credit card numbers can all be considered personal information under LGPD.</p><h3 id="Sensitive-Personal-Data">Sensitive Personal Data</h3><p>Brazil has a culturally and racially diverse population. Like Europe’s GDPR, LGPD recognizes that additional protections are sometimes needed to protect individuals against discrimination. These potentially higher-risk attributes are defined as “sensitive personal data” under LGPD and include:</p><ul><li>Health information</li><li>Genetic information</li><li>Sexual information</li><li>Medical information</li><li>Biometric characteristics</li><li>Racial or ethnic origin information</li><li>Political affiliations</li><li>Religious affiliations</li></ul><h2 id="LGPD-Compliance-Obligations">LGPD Compliance Obligations</h2><p>LGPD is a significant enhancement and consolidation of Brazil’s previous data privacy laws, and the changes will affect organizations in every industry. Below are some of the key compliance considerations businesses will need to consider.</p><h3 id="1--Define-and-Document-Lawful-Basis-for-Processing-Personal-Data">1. Define and Document Lawful Basis for Processing Personal Data</h3><p>LGPD requires every organization that collects or processes personal data to have at least one of the following legally acceptable reasons for doing so, as well as to document those reasons for auditing purposes.</p><ul><li><strong>Consent from an individual to process their data.</strong> Any individual over the age of 18 can consent to the processing of their personal data.</li><li><strong>To follow applicable regulatory requirements and public policies.</strong> Organizations can collect and process data if it is required in order to follow laws and regulations that apply to them.</li><li><strong>For the purpose of conducting a study or research.</strong> Research is a legal basis for personal data processing, as long as organizations take reasonable steps to anonymize that data.</li><li><strong>To fulfill a contractual agreement.</strong> Processing an individual&#39;s personal data is acceptable if you’ve signed a contract with that individual to deliver goods or services and need to process their data to provide it to them.</li><li><strong>Legal proceedings.</strong> Personal data may be processed for the sake of a court case, arbitration, or other legal proceedings.</li><li><strong>To protect the life or physical safety of an individual or a third party.</strong> For example, national security is a legally acceptable reason to process personal data.</li><li><strong>To protect an individual’s health in healthcare procedures.</strong> For example, it’s acceptable to process personal data to ensure you’re not putting a patient at risk during surgery.</li><li><strong>For the legitimate interests of your organization or a third party.</strong> Your organization’s interests are a legal basis for processing personal data, as long as those interests do not conflict with the rights, freedoms, or interests of an individual.</li><li><strong>For the sake of protecting an individual’s credit.</strong> Protecting an individual’s credit is an acceptable basis for processing data, as long as that processing is done in accordance with the provisions laid out in other relevant legislation in addition to LGPD.</li></ul><h3 id="2--Honor-the-Privacy-Rights-of-Individuals">2. Honor the Privacy Rights of Individuals</h3><p>Like GDPR, LGPD provides individuals with several rights that they can request organizations to recognize and uphold at any time. Organizations must have internal procedures and processes in place to respond to requests from individuals who exercise these rights, which include:</p><ul><li><strong>Confirmation of processing.</strong> Individuals have the right to confirm whether their personal data has been or is being processed.</li><li><strong>Access to personal data.</strong> Individuals may request access to any of their personal data that an organization processes.</li><li><strong>Data portability.</strong> Individuals may request that their personal data be transferred to another service or product provider, as long as that request is in accordance with other national regulations, doesn’t compromise any commercial or industrial secrets, and the data hasn’t already been anonymized.</li><li><strong>Rectification of inaccurate information.</strong> Individuals may request that inaccurate, outdated, or incomplete personal data be corrected or updated.</li><li><strong>Anonymization, blocking, or deletion of data.</strong> Individuals can request that unnecessary or excessive personal data, or personal data processed in a non-compliant manner, be anonymized, blocked, or deleted.</li><li><strong>Deletion of data.</strong> Individuals may request to have their personal data deleted at any time where processing is based on consent.</li><li><strong>Right to be informed.</strong> Individuals have the right to be informed about third parties granted access to their personal data. Individuals also have the right to be informed regarding their right to refuse consent.</li><li><strong>Withdrawal of consent.</strong> Individuals have the right to revoke their consent to process or collect data at any time.</li><li><strong>Review of automated decisions.</strong> Individuals have the right to request the review of decisions solely based on automated processing that affects their interests, including profiling.</li><li><strong>Filing complaints.</strong> Individuals may file a complaint against an organization with the ANPD if they feel that any of these rights have been violated.</li></ul><h3 id="3--Appoint-a-Data-Protection-Officer--DPO-">3. Appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO)</h3><p>The LGPD requires every organization under its jurisdiction to appoint a data protection officer (DPO) to be their point person for data protection efforts. The DPO does not have to be an individual person; a committee can provide this service, as can an outside consultant. The DPO is responsible for ensuring that the organization takes appropriate action to protect personal data and for communicating with end-users and government authorities on matters related to data privacy. The identity and contact information of the DPO must be available to the public (preferably on your website).</p><h3 id="4--Prepare--Inventory--and-Conduct-Data-Protection-Impact-Assessments--DPIA-">4. Prepare, Inventory, and Conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA)</h3><p>To comply with LGPD, you must document the types of data you’re collecting, the methods used, along the steps taken to secure that data. You must also identify potential risks and document what you’ve done to mitigate them. Every organization that falls under LGPD’s jurisdiction should have these records on hand to show to a regulator upon request.</p><h3 id="5--Follow-Data-Security-Requirements-and-Data-Breach-Notification-Protocols">5. Follow Data Security Requirements and Data Breach Notification Protocols</h3><p>Organizations must implement adequate organizational and technical controls in order to secure personal data from unauthorized access, deletion, alteration, sharing, or processing. In the event that a breach occurs that presents a risk or causes damage to individuals, organizations must notify the ANPD and individuals affected by the breach within a reasonable time period and include the following information:</p><ul><li>The type of personal data that was exposed and the individuals affected</li><li>The risks associated with the exposure of that data</li><li>The security measures in place to protect personal data (unless sharing this information would disclose industrial or commercial secrets)</li><li>What your organization is doing to mitigate the effects of the breach on the individuals at risk</li></ul><p>The ANPD may require an organization to take further steps, such as alerting the media about the breach or taking specific steps to mitigate the effects of the breach on affected individuals. These actions are assessed on a case-by-case basis.</p><h3 id="6--Implement-Privacy-by-Design">6. Implement Privacy by Design</h3><p>Like GDPR, LGPD requires organizations under its jurisdiction to design their data processing systems and procedures so that privacy is the default setting (the approach known as privacy by design) rather than adding privacy controls to those systems as an afterthought. Organizations should also be prepared to demonstrate the effectiveness of their data protection measures to the ANPD, as an audit could be conducted at any time.</p><h3 id="7--Comply-with-Cross-Border-Data-Transfer-Requirements">7. Comply with Cross-Border Data Transfer Requirements</h3><p>LGPD allows organizations to transfer protected personal data outside of Brazil if the laws of the country the data is transferred to provide adequate protection for that data. Adequacy of protection is determined by the ANPD. In the event that the protections offered by the receiving country are deemed inadequate by the ANPD, transfers may still be allowed if <a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/brazilian-data-protection-law-lgpd-english-translation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">certain conditions</a> are met.</p><h2 id="Penalties-for-Non-Compliance">Penalties for Non-Compliance</h2><p>Under LGPD, penalties for non-compliance are assessed by the ANPD and can include fines of up to 2% of a company’s annual revenue to a maximum of 50 million Brazilian reais per violation (approximately €7.5 million or $9M USD at the time of writing). The ANPD also has the authority to block access to or delete personal data from related databases and to partially or fully prohibit data processing activities in the event that a violation occurs. Additionally, the LGPD provides individuals with the right to seek civil damages for violations of their privacy, meaning organizations could face legal action from consumers in addition to fines assessed by regulators.</p><h2 id="Go-Beyond-Compliance">Go Beyond Compliance</h2><p>Regulations like LGPD and GDPR are landmark steps toward the protection of individuals’ right to privacy. But their similarities should also serve as a wake-up call to organizations everywhere that data privacy will require a lot more than plugging in a new set of controls for their existing systems in the future.</p><p>Instead, businesses should look to build privacy functionality into their systems from the outset, considering the well-being of the end-user rather than just the legal requirements. Not only will this help them earn the <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/do-you-care-about-privacy-as-much-as-your-customers-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trust of consumers</a>, but it will also likely simplify the process of complying with new regulations as they emerge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>State Management in Svelte Applications</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/state-management-in-svelte-applications/</link>
      <description>A tutorial on how to use the Svelte state management store to manage state in Svelte applications.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> As a Front-end developer, one of the most crucial skills to possess is how to manage state in your applications. The ability to synchronize application state with data changes and manage shared state amongst different components is a strong requirement in building modern frontend applications. Several state management libraries have been developed with certain frameworks having a de-facto state management library that they naturally work well with (e.g., <a href="https://redux.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Redux</a> for <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reactjs</a>).</p><p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to perform state management in <a href="https://svelte.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Svelte</a> applications using Svelte&#39;s built-in state management <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/writable-stores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stores</a>.</p><h2 id="What-We-ll-Build">What We&#39;ll Build</h2><p>In this tutorial, you will be implementing state management in a shopping cart built with Svelte. You will begin with a pre-built e-commerce application that sells different types of wares. However, this application is not yet complete, as its shopping features for adding products to the cart and managing cart items have not been implemented. Using the Svelte store, you will be adding the following features to the application:</p><ul><li>Load the products from a central state store</li><li>Add items to the shopping cart</li><li>Display items added to the shopping cart</li><li>Calculate the total price of items in the cart</li><li>Increase and decrease the quantity of the items in the cart</li><li>Remove items from the cart</li></ul><h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><p>There are a few requirements to follow along with this exercise:</p><ul><li><a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Node.js</a> installed on your system. You can visit the website and install a suitable version for your operating system <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</li><li>Basic knowledge of <a href="https://svelte.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Svelte</a> and using <a href="https://svelte.dev/tutorial/nested-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Svelte components</a>.</li></ul><p>With all these in place, you can proceed with the exercise.</p><h2 id="Cloning-the-Demo-E-commerce-Project">Cloning the Demo E-commerce Project</h2><p>To begin, you will clone the starting point for the project and run it. Run the following command to clone a copy of the e-commerce project unto your machine:</p><pre><code><span>git</span> clone --single-branch --branch base-project https://github.com/coderonfleek/svelte-store</code></pre><p>Once you have the project on your system, go into the root of the project and install the dependencies with the following commands:</p><pre><code><span>cd</span> svelte-store
<span>npm</span> <span>install</span></code></pre><p>With all dependencies installed, you can then run the project using the following command:</p><pre><code><span>npm</span> run dev</code></pre><p>This command will boot up a local development server at <a href="http://localhost:5000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>http<span>:</span><span>/</span><span>/</span>localhost<span>:</span><span>5000</span></code></a>.

      <title>The 7 Most Common Types of Cybersecurity Attacks in 2021</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/the-7-most-common-types-of-cybersecurity-attacks-in-2021/</link>
      <description>Learn which cybersecurity tactics and tools will help you combat today&#39;s common cyberattacks.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With more people working remotely or online post-2020, the <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/493198-fbi-sees-spike-in-cyber-crime-reports-during-coronavirus-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FBI reports</a> that cybercriminals are quadrupling the number of cyberattacks they use to disrupt online activities. Research also shows the impact to organizations and their users from a single successful cyberattack is growing each year.</p><p>For example, in 2017, nearly <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273550/data-breaches-recorded-in-the-united-states-by-number-of-breaches-and-records-exposed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>197 million records</em></a> were exposed due to data breaches. In 2020, that number <a href="https://pages.riskbasedsecurity.com/hubfs/Reports/2020/2020%20Year%20End%20Data%20Breach%20QuickView%20Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grew to 37 billion</a>, even though the overall number of data breaches had decreased. And IBM reports that the costs are growing for organizations that fall victim to these attacks in countries like the United States, where the average cost of a data breach grew from $7.91M to $8.64M between <a href="https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/861MNWN2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2018</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2020</a>.</p><p>Many of the methods cybercriminals use to breach organizations rely on human error. Even your sharpest employees can become your greatest weakness if they click on a malicious link without realizing it. However, other cyberattacks exploit gaps in your <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-data-security/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data security</a> efforts to gain access to sensitive data.</p><p>Below are seven of the most common cyberattacks your organization will face in 2021 and the ways to protect yourself against the data breaches they have the potential to cause.</p><h2 id="1--Malware-Attacks">1. Malware Attacks</h2><p>Malware refers to many different types of malicious software designed to infiltrate, spy on, or create a backdoor and control an organization’s systems or data. This includes ransomware, worms, trojans, adware, and spyware. <a href="https://monstercloud.com/blog/2020/03/23/coronavirus-alert-ransomware-attacks-up-by-800/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Experts report</a> that malware usage is up almost 800% since early 2020.</p><p>Malware has the potential to cause major data breaches and severely disrupt business operations. Microsoft was the victim of a major ransomware attack, where WannaCry <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took advantage of a weak spot in their operating system</a> and displayed the following message to banks, health care providers, manufacturers, and other businesses across the globe:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/1eCk2eoRxo2dlqfakT2rLF/3d36517813cea24b63b795f7fe3a256c/Uploaded_from_The_7_Most_Common_Types_of_Cybersecurity_Attacks_in_2021" alt="image.png"/>
</p><p><i><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/cybercrime/2017/05/wanacrypt0r-ransomware-hits-it-big-just-before-the-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a></i></p><p>To regain access to their computers, along with any files that hadn’t been backed up, businesses had to pay a ransom to the creators of the WannaCry program in <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>.</p><p>Malware is typically downloaded unwittingly by clicking a malicious link or by tricking a user into thinking they&#39;re downloading something legitimate when they’re not.</p><h3 id="How-to-Protect-Against-Malware-Attacks">How to Protect Against Malware Attacks</h3><p>Teaching your employees how to spot suspicious links and pop-ups that could contain malware will help reduce the chance that it could infect your systems.</p><p>Additional ways to protect against malware include keeping your operating systems up to date to ensure known security gaps are patched and using anti-virus software. For example, the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/equifax-breach-no-excuse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Equifax</a> data breach could have been prevented had a known patch been installed in time.</p><h2 id="2--Phishing-Attacks">2. Phishing Attacks</h2><p>Phishing attacks attempt to steal information from users or trick them into downloading malware by sending malicious emails or text messages (SMS) that look like real requests but are, in fact, a Scam. Here’s a Dropbox email asking users to verify their email address that’s actually a phishing attack:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/2ISbM89J8qjqwVy4kUpgOf/a1b52597302c386ee8381bfd6f6948d9/Uploaded_from_The_7_Most_Common_Types_of_Cybersecurity_Attacks_in_2021" alt="image.png"/> 
</p><p><i><a href="https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/locky-returns-via-spam-dropbox-themed-phishing-attacks-a-10250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Source</a></i></p><p>According to <a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/2020/results-and-analysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verizon’s 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report</a>, phishing attacks are the most common cause of data breaches globally and have been the root cause of notable instances of cybercrime in the last decade.</p><p>The cybercriminals who breached the AP News Twitter account and falsely <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-21508660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tweeted</a> that the White House was under attack used a targeted phishing attack (spear-phishing) to gain access to the account, as did the bad actors who leaked sensitive emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-phishing-email-that-hacked-the-account-of-john-podesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before the 2016 election</a>.</p><h3 id="How-to-Protect-Against-Phishing-Attacks">How to Protect Against Phishing Attacks</h3><p>The best way to protect your organization against phishing attacks is to educate your employees on how to spot a questionable email or text message. The training programs below can help you do this:</p><ul><li><em>Digital Defense’s</em> <a href="https://www.digitaldefense.com/professional-services/secured-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>SecurED training program</em></a></li><li><em>Inspired eLearning’s</em> <a href="https://inspiredelearning.com/security-awareness/awareness-c-suite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Security Awareness</em></a></li></ul><p>Additionally, CSO has compiled a list of resources that can help you train your teams to spot phishing attacks <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3225471/please-dont-send-me-to-cybersecurity-training.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><h2 id="3--Distributed-Denial-of-Service-Attacks">3. Distributed Denial of Service Attacks</h2><p>Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks disrupt the traffic to a website, application, server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic from compromised computer networks (<a href="https://usa.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/botnet-attacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">botnets</a>) that prevents real users from accessing it. In 2018, GitHub experienced the largest DDoS attack ever when it was hit with 1.35 terabits of traffic per second and was <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/github-ddos-memcached/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offline for almost 20 minutes as a result</a>.</p><p>DDoS attacks are common and increased by 50% in 2020 compared to 2019, with a large surge occurring in early 2020 during the pandemic, according to security company <a href="https://securelist.com/ddos-attacks-in-q3-2020/99171/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kaspersky</a>.</p><h3 id="How-to-Protect-Against-DDoS-Attacks">How to Protect Against DDoS Attacks</h3><p>DDoS attacks are tricky to identify because they’re often hard to distinguish from legitimate traffic. Some <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">methods of protecting against DDoS attacks</a> include blocking all traffic for a short period of time, rate-limiting traffic to a website, using a web application firewall to detect suspicious traffic patterns, or scattering traffic across a network of servers to reduce the attack’s impact.</p><h2 id="4--Man-in-the-Middle-Attacks">4. Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h2><p>Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks are when bad actors spy on or intercept communication between you and your users or employees. MitM attacks are most commonly used to steal personal or company information or to redirect that information to another destination or in espionage situations, such as when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/04/how-russian-spies-bungled-cyber-attack-on-weapons-watchdog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Russian hackers</a> attempted to breach the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).</p><p>MitM attacks are <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3340117/what-is-a-man-in-the-middle-attack-how-mitm-attacks-work-and-how-to-prevent-them.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not the most common cyberattack</a> because many of the same objectives can be achieved using malware. However, MitM attacks do present a threat for organizations because they’re often hard to spot and because <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201215005287/en/Upwork-Study-Finds-22-of-American-Workforce-Will-Be-Remote-by-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more employees are working remotely</a> post-2020.</p><p>For example, fake WiFi networks are <a href="https://hackernoon.com/a-hacker-intercepted-your-wifi-traffic-stole-your-contacts-passwords-financial-data-heres-how-4fc0df9ff152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easy to deploy</a> in public places like coffee shops where remote employees often work. People often connect to these networks without realizing it, allowing bad actors to spy on them while they use the network.</p><h3 id="How-to-Protect-Against-MitM-Attacks">How to Protect Against MitM Attacks</h3><p>End-to-end encryption protocols like <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transport Layer Security</a> (TLS) are the best way to protect against MitM attacks. Additionally, requiring your employees to use a VPN to access company networks over public WiFi will ensure that any information shared during their session remains private, regardless of whether the network belongs to a bad actor or if their coffee shop’s WiFi is simply unsecured.</p><h2 id="5--Credential-Stuffing-Attacks">5. Credential Stuffing Attacks</h2><p><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-credential-stuffing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credential stuffing</a> is a type of brute-force cyber-attack where bad actors use stolen usernames and passwords from one data breach to access user accounts at another organization.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/1WPDZfXKzHLheBp0XbP2em/6769d8d365597a77b9de207e48c303d8/Uploaded_from_The_7_Most_Common_Types_of_Cybersecurity_Attacks_in_2021" alt="image.png"/></p><p>Credential stuffing is possible because, statistically, <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_security_infographic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">65% of all people</a> reuse the same password across multiple accounts. As a result, credential stuffing attacks are one of the <a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/resources/reports/dbir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most common</a> causes of data breaches globally.</p><h3 id="How-to-Protect-Against-Credential-Stuffing-Attacks">How to Protect Against Credential Stuffing Attacks</h3><p>The best way to protect against credential stuffing attacks is by either implementing <a href="https://auth0.com/passwordless/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passwordless authentication</a> or <a href="https://auth0.com/multifactor-authentication" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multi-factor authentication</a> (MFA). Passwordless authentication prevents bad actors from using stolen credentials by eliminating them altogether, while MFA requires bad actors to verify their identity in one or more ways in addition to the stolen credentials they’re using to log in.</p><h2 id="6--Password-Spraying-Attacks">6. Password Spraying Attacks</h2><p>Password spraying is also a type of brute-force attack where bad actors attempt to guess a user’s password from a list of common passwords like “123456” or “password.”</p><p>Like credential stuffing, password spraying is quite common. For example, Verizon’s 2020 Data Breach Report showed that over <a href="https://enterprise.verizon.com/content/verizonenterprise/us/en/index/resources/reports/2020-data-breach-investigations-report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">80% of all hacking-related data breaches</a> involved brute-force methods like password spraying.</p><h3 id="How-to-Protect-Against-Password-Spraying-Attacks">How to Protect Against Password Spraying Attacks</h3><p>Password spraying attacks can be prevented by using passwordless authentication or MFA, just like credential stuffing attacks can be. However, you can also reduce the risk and impact of a data breach via password spraying by following the <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/dont-pass-on-the-new-nist-password-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NIST Password Guidelines</a>, which are considered the best password standards in the world.</p><h2 id="7--Mobile-Device-Attacks">7. Mobile Device Attacks</h2><p><a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/content/dam/tfb/pdf/T-Mobile-for-Business-2020-Workplace-Mobility-Report.pdf?icid=TFB_TMO_P_TFBFTRWRKS_7LCBNVDVYBXY27WF321599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Many organizations are working to increase the mobility</a> of their workforce because it improves operational efficiency and productivity. However, cybercriminals are well aware of this fact and are targeting mobile devices more frequently <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/mobile-malware-attacks-are-booming-in-2019-these-are-the-most-common-threats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year</a> over <a href="https://www.mcafee.com/content/dam/consumer/en-us/docs/2020-Mobile-Threat-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year</a> with a variety of attacks on this list, which puts organizations at risk for a data breach through more devices than before.</p><p><a href="https://blog.lookout.com/lookout-trident-pegasus-enterprise-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pegasus attack</a> on Apple’s iOS software is a prime example. Pegasus infected iPhones through phishing text messages that asked recipients to click on a link inside the text message. Clicking the link triggered the installation of spyware capable of monitoring people through their camera and microphone. And once infected, users had their login credentials stolen from WhatsApp, Gmail, and other sensitive communication applications.</p><h3 id="How-to-Protect-Against-Mobile-Device-Attacks">How to Protect Against Mobile Device Attacks</h3><p>Protecting your organization against mobile security threats requires a strong enterprise mobility management (EMM) program, as well as mobile device management (MDM) tools that help you protect any company data that may be on your employees’ personal or work devices. Identity and access management tools like multi-factor authentication can also help secure any work applications that contain sensitive information from unauthorized access.</p><h2 id="Create-Additional-Layers-of-Security-at-the-Login-Stage">Create Additional Layers of Security at the Login Stage</h2><p>The impact of many cyberattacks on this list (as well as <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://auth0.com/resources/whitepapers/state-of-security-identity-report&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1624045583510000&amp;usg=AOvVaw0jtWJoRiARLi1pwCySdu1J" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others that many companies face</a>) can be mitigated or prevented with strong authentication protocols.</p><p>First and foremost, this means good password policies and sound employee education. However, taking the next step to <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://auth0.com/login-security&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1624045583512000&amp;usg=AOvVaw2FeIurZ9Qr026LNUW7RDFZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">secure login procedures</a> with security functionality like multi-factor authentication, <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/attack-protection/brute-force-protection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brute-force protection</a>, or passwordless authentication can add a new dimension of safety to your system.</p><p>Auth0 makes it easy to build secure authentication for the right people without compromising on user experience — <a href="https://auth0.com/resources/videos/platform-introduction-video-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn more about Auth0’s platform here</a>.</p><div><h2 id="About-Auth0">About Auth0 </h2><p>Auth0’s modern approach to identity enables organizations to provide secure access to any application, for any user.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year, WWDC came with a bunch of new features and updates. Maybe one of the most expected was the introduction of the new concurrency system by using async/await syntax. This is a huge improvement in the way that we write asynchronous code. </p><h2 id="Before-Async-Await">Before Async/Await</h2><p>Imagine that we are working on an app for a grocery store and, we want to display its list of products. We are probably going to have something like this:</p><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span><span>_</span> completion<span>:</span> @<span>escaping</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>Product</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>}</span>

<span>var</span> products <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>Product</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
fetchProducts <span>{</span> <span>[</span><span>weak</span> <span>self</span><span>]</span> products <span>in</span>
    <span>guard</span> <span>let</span> strongSelf <span>=</span> <span>self</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>}</span>
    strongSelf<span>.</span>products<span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span>contentsOf<span>:</span> products<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>A pretty standard and well-known code using completion blocks. Now suppose that the grocery store has, once in a while, some kind of offers for some products (e.g., &#34;Take 2, pay 1&#34;). And, we want to hold a list with these offers. Let&#39;s adjust our code by creating a new function to retrieve a String with the promotion text, given a specific product.</p><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span><span>_</span> completion<span>:</span> @<span>escaping</span><span>(</span><span>[</span><span>Product</span><span>]</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>}</span>
<span>func</span> <span>getOffer</span><span>(</span><span>for</span> product<span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> @<span>escaping</span><span>(</span><span>String</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Void</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>}</span>

<span>typealias</span> <span>ProductOffer</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span>productId<span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>,</span> offer<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span>
<span>var</span> products <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>Product</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>var</span> offers <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>ProductOffer</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

fetchProducts <span>{</span> <span>[</span><span>weak</span> <span>self</span><span>]</span> products <span>in</span>
    <span>guard</span> <span>let</span> strongSelf <span>=</span> <span>self</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>for</span> product <span>in</span> products <span>{</span>
        strongSelf<span>.</span>products<span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span>product<span>)</span>

        <span>getOffer</span><span>(</span><span>for</span><span>:</span> product<span>.</span>id<span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>[</span><span>weak</span> <span>self</span><span>]</span> offerText <span>in</span>
            <span>guard</span> <span>let</span> strongSelf <span>=</span> <span>self</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>}</span>
            <span>let</span> productOffer <span>=</span> <span>ProductOffer</span><span>(</span>productId<span>:</span> product<span>.</span>id<span>,</span> offer<span>:</span> offerText<span>)</span>
            strongSelf<span>.</span>offers<span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span>productOffer<span>)</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>We only have two nested closures for a simple feature, and you can see that our code starts to get a little messed up.</p><h2 id="Async-Await">Async/Await</h2><p>From Swift 5.5 onwards, we can start using async/await functions to write asynchronous code without using completion handlers to returns values. Instead, we are allowed to return the values in the return object directly.</p><p>To mark a function as asynchronous, we only have to put the keyword <strong>async</strong> before the return type.</p><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> async <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>Product</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>}</span>
<span>func</span> <span>getOffer</span><span>(</span><span>for</span> product<span>:</span> <span>Int</span><span>)</span> async <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>String</span> <span>{</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>This is much easier and simple to read, but the best part comes from the caller&#39;s side. When we want to use the result of a function marked as <strong>async,</strong> we need to make sure that its execution is already completed. To make this possible, we need to write the <strong>await</strong> keyword in front of the function call. By doing this, the current execution will be paused until the result is available for its use.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> products <span>=</span> await <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

<span>for</span> product <span>in</span> products <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> offerText <span>=</span> await <span>getOffer</span><span>(</span><span>for</span><span>:</span> product<span>.</span>id<span>)</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>!</span>offerText<span>.</span><span>isEmpty</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> productOffer <span>=</span> <span>ProductOffer</span><span>(</span>productId<span>:</span> product<span>.</span>id<span>,</span> offer<span>:</span> offerText<span>)</span>
        offers<span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span>productOffer<span>)</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Although, if we want to execute other tasks while the async function is being executed, we should put the keyword <strong>async</strong> in front of the variable (or let) declaration. In this case, the <strong>await</strong> keyword will need to be placed in front of the variable (or let) where we are accessing the result of the async function.</p><pre><code>async <span>let</span> products <span>=</span> <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>// Do some work</span>
<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span>await products<span>)</span></code></pre><h3 id="Parallel-Asynchronous-Functions">Parallel Asynchronous Functions</h3><p>Now imagine that in our app, we want to fetch products by category—for example, just the frozen products. Let&#39;s go ahead and make the adjustments to our code.</p><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>ProductCategory</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> frozen
    <span>case</span> meat
    <span>case</span> vegetables
    <span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>func</span> <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span>fromCategory category<span>:</span> <span>ProductCategory</span><span>)</span> async <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>Product</span><span>]</span> <span>{</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>}</span>

<span>let</span> frozenProducts <span>=</span> await <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span>fromCategory<span>:</span> <span>.</span>frozen<span>)</span>
<span>let</span> meatProducts <span>=</span> await <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span>fromCategory<span>:</span> <span>.</span>meat<span>)</span>
<span>let</span> vegetablesProducts <span>=</span> await <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span>fromCategory<span>:</span> <span>.</span>vegetals<span>)</span></code></pre><p>This is ok, but the code will run in serial mode,  which means that we won&#39;t start fetching the meat products until the frozen products are retrieved. Same for the vegetables. Remember, we write the <strong>await</strong> keyword if we want to pause our execution until the function completes its work. However, in this particular scenario, we could start fetching the three categories at the same time, running in parallel.</p><p>In order to accomplish this, we need to write the <strong>async</strong> keyword in front of the var (or let) declaration and use the <strong>await</strong> keyword when we want to use it.</p><pre><code>async <span>let</span> frozenProducts <span>=</span> await <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span>fromCategory<span>:</span> <span>.</span>frozen<span>)</span>
async <span>let</span> meatProducts <span>=</span> await <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span>fromCategory<span>:</span> <span>.</span>meat<span>)</span>
async <span>let</span> vegetablesProducts <span>=</span> await <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span>fromCategory<span>:</span> <span>.</span>vegetables<span>)</span> 

<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>

<span>let</span> products <span>=</span> await <span>[</span>frozenProducts<span>,</span> meatProducts<span>,</span> vegetablesProducts<span>]</span></code></pre><h3 id="Error-handlers">Error handlers</h3><p>Our fetching functions might have some errors that make it impossible to return the expected data values. How do we handle this in our async/await context?</p><p>We have a couple of options. The first one is to return the well-known Result object.</p><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> async <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>[</span><span>Product</span><span>]</span><span>,</span> <span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>}</span>

<span>let</span> result <span>=</span> <span>try</span> await <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>switch</span> result <span>{</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>.</span><span>success</span><span>(</span><span>let</span> products<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>// Handle success</span>
    <span>case</span> <span>.</span><span>failure</span><span>(</span><span>let</span> error<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>// Handle error</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Another one is to use the try/catch approach.</p><pre><code><span>func</span> <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> async <span>throws</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>[</span><span>Product</span><span>[</span> <span>{</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span><span>}</span>
<span>.</span><span>.</span><span>.</span>
<span>do</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> products <span>=</span> <span>try</span> await <span>fetchProducts</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// Handle the error</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>The main benefit that we had when using the Result type was to improve our completion handlers. In addition to that, we got a cleaner code at the moment we used the result, being able to switch between success and failure cases.</p><p>On the other hand, the use of throw errors adds extra readability in the function&#39;s definition because we only need to put the result type that the function will return. The errors handling is hidden in the function&#39;s implementation.</p><h3 id="Asynchronous-Sequences">Asynchronous Sequences</h3><p>Let&#39;s say that we have a requirement to load a list of products from some .csv file. A traditional way to do this is to load all the lines at once and then start processing them. But, what happens if we want to start doing some work as soon as we have one of the lines available? We can now do this using an asynchronous sequence.</p><pre><code><span>let</span> url <span>=</span> <span>URL</span><span>(</span>string<span>:</span> <span>&#34;http://www.grocery.com/products.csv&#34;</span><span>)</span>
<span>for</span> <span>try</span> await <span>in</span> url<span>.</span>lines <span>{</span>
    <span>// Do some work</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Using this new feature also allows us to handle this particular case (reading a file) in a simpler way than before. You can check this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24581517/read-a-file-url-line-by-line-in-swift" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stackoverflow discussion</a> to see how we had to do this and see the advantages that this approach has over the previous one.</p><h3 id="Async-Await-vs--Completion-Handlers">Async/Await vs. Completion Handlers</h3><p>As we saw in the previous sections, the use of async/await syntax comes with a lot of improvements in contrast with using completion blocks. Let&#39;s make a quick recap.</p><h4 id="Advantages">Advantages</h4><ul><li>Avoid the Pyramid of Doom problem with nested closures</li><li>Reduction of code</li><li>Easier to read</li><li>Safety. With async/await, a result is guaranteed, while completion blocks might or might not be called.</li></ul><h4 id="Disadvantages">Disadvantages</h4><ul><li>It&#39;s only available from Swift 5.5 and iOS 15 onwards.</li></ul><h2 id="Actors">Actors</h2><p>Take a look at the following example, just a simple Order class in which we will be adding products and eventually make the checkout.</p><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Order</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>var</span> products <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>Product</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>var</span> finalPrice <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

    <span>func</span> <span>addProduct</span><span>(</span><span>_</span> product<span>:</span> <span>Product</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        products<span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span>product<span>)</span>
        finalPrice <span>+</span><span>=</span> product<span>.</span>price
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>If we are in a single-thread application, this code is just fine. But what happens if we have multiple threads that can access our order&#39;s final price? </p><ol start="1"><li>We are on the product list and add some specific products to our order. The app will call the <strong>addProduct</strong> function.</li><li>The product is added to our order&#39;s product list</li><li>Before the final price gets updated, the user tries to checkout.</li><li>The app will read the final price of our order</li><li>The <strong>addProduct</strong> function completes and updates the final price. But the user already checkout and paid less than they should.</li></ol><p>This problem is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Data Races</strong></a> when some particular resource could be accessed from multiple parts of the app&#39;s code.</p><p>Actors, also introduced in Swift 5.5 and iOS 15, resolve this problem for us. An Actor is basically like a class but with a few key differences that make them <em>thread-safe</em>:</p><ul><li>Only allow accessing their state by one task at a time</li><li>Stored properties and functions can only be access from outside the Actor if the operation is performed asynchronously.</li><li>Stored properties can&#39;t be written from outside the Actor.</li></ul><p>On the downside:</p><ul><li>Actors do not support inheritance</li></ul><p>You can think about the Actors like a similar solution of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">semaphores</a>) concept.</p><p>To create one, we just need to use the <strong>actor</strong> keyword.</p><pre><code>actor <span>Order</span> <span>{</span>
    
    <span>var</span> products <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>Product</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
    <span>var</span> finalPrice <span>=</span> <span>0</span>

    <span>func</span> <span>addProduct</span><span>(</span><span>_</span> product<span>:</span> <span>Product</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        products<span>.</span><span>append</span><span>(</span>product<span>)</span>
        finalPrice <span>+</span><span>=</span> product<span>.</span>price
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>And we can create an instance using the same initializer syntax as structures and classes. If we want to access the final price, we must do it using the keyword await (because outside the actor&#39;s scope, we are only allowed to access the properties asynchronously).</p><pre><code><span>print</span><span>(</span>await order<span>.</span>finalPrice<span>)</span></code></pre><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Definitely <strong>async/await</strong> brings to the table an easier way to write asynchronous code, removing the need to use completion blocks. In addition, we get more readable and flexible code if our application starts scaling up. </p><p>However, the minimum iOS deployment target will be an entry barrier for most of us unless you start a project from scratch, in which case is highly recommended to wait until the official release of iOS 15 + Xcode 13 + Swift 5.5  to take full advantage of the new concurrency system.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>See how easy it is to bootstrap a CRUD API with Spring Initializr, build it with Spring Boot and Kotlin, and secure it with Auth0.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> In this article, you’ll learn how to quickly build a RESTful API using the Spring Boot framework and the Kotlin programming language. You’ll then use Auth0 to secure the API so that only authorized parties can use its key functions. You can find the final code for the project developed throughout this article in <a href="https://github.com/AccordionGuy/HotSauces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this GitHub repository</a>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Look for the 🌶 emoji if you’d like to skim through the content while focusing on the build and execution steps.</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="Spring-Framework--Spring-Boot--and-Kotlin--An-Overview">Spring Framework, Spring Boot, and Kotlin: An Overview</h2><p>Before we start building the project, let’s look at the frameworks and language you’ll use.</p><h3 id="Spring-Framework">Spring Framework</h3><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/6WdgKiAbhNyVIQWDECzf48/fc4dd3f38700ba0f9a143bdaee8c9479/spring_icon.png" alt="Spring Framework icon"/></p><p><a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring Framework</a>, often shortened to just “Spring”, is a popular open source application framework for the Java platform. It’s built on the principle of <a href="https://dzone.com/articles/understanding-inversion-of-control-and-dependency" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inversion of control</a>, whose name implies that control of a Spring application is the opposite of how program control works in traditional applications. Instead of your code directing the application and calling on functionality from a library, the framework directs the application and calls on functionality from your code.</p><p>This approach makes it possible to write an application as a collection of components, with the connections between them maintained by Spring. Spring provides a lot of ready-built components called <em>dependencies</em> that provide functionality that applications commonly require. The end result is a system for building applications that are modular, flexible, quicker to write, and easy to maintain.</p><p>Spring is often described — especially by Java developers, who’ve grown used to working with unwieldy frameworks — as lightweight. It provides a set of built-in often-needed capabilities such as MVC, caching, messaging, security, and data access. It significantly reduces the amount of code you have to write and lets you focus on the functionality specific to your application.</p><p>While Spring is often used for web and server-based applications, it’s a general application framework and it can be used to write desktop and mobile applications as well.</p><h3 id="Spring-Boot">Spring Boot</h3><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/17rXel2g1r2rxiGkpeHNSy/dd64d06b65c7e095b6bcdeffecbd0a9f/spring_boot_icon.png" alt="Spring Boot icon"/></p><p><a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring Boot</a> is a framework built on top of Spring that simplifies Spring development. It does this by enforcing an <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-Opinionated-Framework" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opinionated</a> approach to Spring application development through <a href="https://facilethings.com/blog/en/convention-over-configuration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“convention over configuration”</a>, the use of default setups that applications are likely to use, and a standardized application structure created by a generator that goes by the decidedly “Web 2.0” name of <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring Initializr</a>. Thanks to this “it just works” approach, it’s the fastest way to develop applications with the Spring framework.</p><h3 id="Kotlin">Kotlin</h3><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/1lE1Sn0pHAIa082QVEhJ0f/b4c6184a9387900f457d260d6e0aeb38/kotlin_icon.png" alt="Kotlin icon"/></p><p><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotlin</a> is part of the wave of programming languages that appeared in the 2010s, which includes <a href="https://dart.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dart</a>, <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Go</a>, <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rust</a>, and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Swift</a>. These languages have a number of common traits including their own takes on object-oriented programming from the lessons of the 1990s and functional programming from the lessons of the 2000s, inferred strong static typing, and meteoric rises in popularity (all of them are in <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TIOBE’s index of popular programming languages</a>, and all of them except Kotlin are in the top 20).</p><p>As a programming language designed by <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a company that makes developer tools</a>, Kotlin is unique in its origin. It was designed to be an <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/comparison-to-java.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improvement on Java</a>, with many of the language features of <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scala</a> (but faster compile times) and with the power and convenience that comes from interoperability with Java and the Java platform. It has grown to become the preferred language for Android app development; as of July 2021, <a href="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/stories?linkId=94116374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">80% of the top 1,000 apps in Google Play were written in Kotlin.</a> According to JetBrains’ <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>State of Developer Ecosystem 2020</em> report,</a> Kotlin is also making serious inroads into web and enterprise development territory.</p><p>Since Spring and Spring Boot are based on the Java platform, you can use them to build applications using any JVM-based programming language, including Kotlin. If Java’s verbosity is bringing you down, or if you’re an Android developer who wants to write the back end for your app but don’t want to switch languages, Spring and Spring Boot development in Kotlin is for you!</p><h2 id="What-You-ll-Build--A-Hot-Sauce-API">What You’ll Build: A Hot Sauce API</h2><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/5VZbuSuMi49Zp9x0bmAK7b/fdd5ca6bac1efdd66ce9e5984e62b0ae/a-hot-sauce-api.jpg" alt="A Hot Sauce API (A tray of hot sauce bottles, viewed from above))"/></p><p>You’ll build an API that acts as a catalog of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_sauce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot sauces</a>.

<span>)</span></code></pre><p><code>HotSauce</code> is a Kotlin <strong><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/data-classes.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data class</a></strong>, whose job is to hold data. Data classes are all properties and no methods — or at least no <em>explicitly</em> defined methods, anyway. The compiler automatically provides a handful of “behind the scenes” methods to data classes, including <code><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code>, <code><span>hashCode</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code>, and <code><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code>.</p><p>Kotlin classes, data classes included, have a constructor built into the class header. This constructor, called the <strong>primary constructor</strong>, takes its parameters in the parentheses that follow the class name. <code>HotSauce</code>, like many data classes, is just a class header and primary constructor, and nothing else.</p><p>Even though there isn’t much to the class, it uses some annotations to pull in a lot of extra functionality:</p><ul><li><code>HotSauce</code> is annotated with <code>@Entity</code>, which informs the Java Persistence API (JPA, one of the dependencies that you added in Spring Initializr) that its instances will be persisted in the database.</li><li>The <code>id</code> property is annotated with both <code>@Id</code> and <code>@GeneratedValue</code>, which makes sense, as it will map to the <code>id</code> field in the corresponding database table.</li><li>The <code>@Lob</code> annotation is short for “large object”. It’s being used to annotate the <code>description</code> and <code>url</code> properties because they could contain strings longer than 256 characters. By default, JPA maps <code>String</code>s in entities to the <code><span>VARCHAR</span><span>(</span><span>256</span><span>)</span></code> type in the database; marking a <code>String</code> as <code>@Lob</code> tells JPA to map it to the <code><span>TEXT</span></code> type instead.</li></ul><p>If you’re new to Kotlin, make note of the keywords in the class’ property declarations:</p><ul><li><code>val</code> is short for “value” and declares a constant. A hot sauce’s <code>id</code> value shouldn’t be changed after it’s been created, so we’re declaring it with <code>val</code>.</li><li><code><span>var</span></code> is short for “variable” and that’s what it declares. All the other class properties should be editable, so we’re declaring them with <code><span>var</span></code>.</li></ul><p>You might be wondering about assigning the value <code><span>0</span></code> to <code>id</code>, which is a constant:</p><pre><code>@Id @<span>GeneratedValue</span><span>(</span>strategy <span>=</span> GenerationType<span>.</span><span>AUTO</span><span>)</span>
val id<span>:</span> Long <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></code></pre><p>The line <code>val id<span>:</span> Long <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span></code> might make you think that every hot sauce will have an unchangeable <code>id</code> set to <code><span>0</span></code>. As a constant, the value of <code>id</code> can’t be changed by any code that <em>you</em> write, but the <code>@GeneratedValue</code> annotation allows Spring to use <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reflection.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reflection</a> to get around that limitation and assign a unique <code>id</code> value for every sauce. Every modern application framework incorporates “magic” like this; I’ve found that it’s simplest just to know where such instances are and to accept them.</p><p>With <code>HotSauce</code> defined, you have a <strong>model</strong> that represents hot sauces in the real world. By annotating it with <code>@Entity</code>, you’ve specified that instances of <code>HotSauce</code> should be converted into <strong>entities</strong> — that is, instances that have been saved to a database.</p><p>It’s time to set up something to save <code>HotSauce</code> instances.</p><h3 id="Adding-Data-Access-with-a--CrudRepository-">Adding Data Access with a <code>CrudRepository</code></h3><p>The <a href="https://deviq.com/repository-pattern/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Repository pattern</a> provides a layer of abstraction between an application’s models and the system used to store data. A repository provides a collection-style interface to the models, with methods for retrieving the whole collection, retrieving a specific item, and adding, editing, and deleting items. The repository insulates the models from the usual database concerns, such as connecting with it, setting up a reader, or worrying about things like cursors.</p><p>Spring provides a number of repository interfaces. In this project, you’ll use the <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>CrudRepository</code></a> interface to act as the intermediary between <code>HotSauce</code> and the H2 database (another one of the dependencies you added in Spring Initializr) as shown below:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/2CCk6CDxAKOrF7RJ6F05nw/8a14bb24936eaa0efc2364a31cb551bc/repository-pattern.png" alt="Repository Pattern"/></p><p>In this exercise, the underlying data store is the H2 in-memory database. The Repository pattern makes it so that changing the database doesn’t require you to make any changes to <code>HotSauce</code>, and Spring’s inversion of control architecture makes it so that such a change doesn’t even require a change to the <code>CrudRepository</code>.</p><p>🌶 Create a new file named <strong>HotSauceRepository.kt</strong> in the <strong>/src/main/kotlin/com/auth0/hotsauces/</strong> directory:</p><pre><code><span>// /src/main/kotlin/com/auth0/hotsauces/HotSauceRepository.kt</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>The code is considerably less complex than it could be, thanks to some annotations which take care of a lot of tedious REST work:</p><ul><li><code>HotSauceController</code> is annotated with <code>@RestController</code>, which informs Spring Web (yet another one of the dependencies that you added in Spring Initializr) that this class is a REST controller and that it should include the necessary underlying REST functionality.</li><li><code>HotSauceController</code> is also annotated with <code>@<span>RequestMapping</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;/api/hotsauces&#34;</span><span>)</span></code> which means that every method in the class that responds to a request responds to requests whose endpoint ends with <code>api<span>/</span>hotsauces</code>.</li><li>Any method annotated with <code>@<span>GetMapping</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> responds to <code><span>GET</span></code> requests. If <code>@<span>GetMapping</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> takes a parameter, it means that it responds to requests whose endpoint begins with that parameter. Parameters in braces (<code><span>{</span></code> and <code><span>}</span></code>) are variable parameters.</li><li>Any method annotated with <code>@<span>PostMapping</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code>, <code>@<span>PutMapping</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code>, and <code>@<span>DeleteMapping</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> is similar to a method annotated with <code>@<span>GetMapping</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> except that they respond to <code><span>POST</span></code>, <code><span>PUT</span></code>, and <code><span>DELETE</span></code> requests respectively.</li></ul><p>Every method in the class returns a <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/spring-response-entity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>ResponseEntity</code></a> object, which represents a complete HTTP response, complete with status code, headers, and body.</p><p>Take a look at each of these methods to see what kind of <code>ResponseEntity</code> they return. Sometimes, they’ll simply return an HTTP status code, as is the case with <code><span>deleteHotSauce</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code>, which returns either <code><span>NO_CONTENT</span></code> if the hot sauce was found and deleted or <code><span>NOT_FOUND</span></code> if the hot sauce requested for deletion was not in the database. Other methods may return a more complex <code>ResponseEntity</code>, such as <code><span>getHotSauce</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code>, which returns an <code><span>OK</span></code> status code and a <code>HotSauce</code> object if the given <code>id</code> matches a hot sauce in the database.</p><p>You may have noticed the <code>@RequestParam</code> annotations in the signature of the <code><span>getAll</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> method. These map the parameters in the HTTP GET query string to <code><span>getAll</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code>’s parameters. The first annotation declares that value in <code>brandname</code> query parameter is mapped to the <code><span>getAll</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> method’s <code>brandNameFilter</code> parameter, that <code>brandname</code> is an optional query parameter, and if it isn’t used, its value should default to the empty string. The other <code>@RequestParam</code> annotations work in a similar manner.</p><h3 id="Initializing-the-database">Initializing the database</h3><p>You could run the app right now and it would work.

                    mustard and spice flavours. This would be great on jerk chicken, or Indian food! But then, WHAM!

                    the heat right away, but others can take a few minutes for the full impact to set in. The heat can
                    last up to 20 minutes, creating a perfect match between very high heat and amazing flavor. Try it
                    on all your favorite foods - wings, chili, soups, steak or even a sandwich in need of a major kick.

                    yet again collaborated with an Ontario craft brewery, this time from their home town of Thunder Bay.
                    Made with the help of Sleeping Giant Brewery’s award winning Beaver Duck session IPA, this sauce has
                    a boldly pronounced fruitiness and a bright but savoury vibe from start to finish.

<span>}</span></code></pre><p>This class has a couple of annotations:</p><ul><li><code>DataLoader</code> is annotated with <code>@Component</code>, which marks it so that Spring will autodetect the class when it’s needed. Since the code in this class references the application’s instance of <code>HotSauceRepository</code>, this class will be instantiated when an instance of <code>HotSauceRepository</code> is created.</li><li>The <code><span>loadData</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> method is annotated with <code>@PostConstruct</code>, which specifies that it should be called as soon as the class has been initialized. This annotation is often used to populate databases when a Spring application is launched.</li></ul><h4 id="Kotlin-Extensions">Kotlin Extensions</h4><p>This class also makes use of a handy Kotlin feature: <strong><a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Extensions</a></strong>. These are properties or functions that can be added to classes to extend their capabilities without having to access their code.</p><p>At the beginning of the class, you added an extension to the <code>String</code> class:</p><pre><code><span>fun</span> String<span>.</span><span>trimIndentsAndRemoveNewlines</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>trimIndent</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;\n&#34;</span><span>,</span> <span>&#34; &#34;</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>This adds the method <code><span>trimIndentsAndRemoveNewlines</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> to the <code>String</code> class, which removes indentations and newline characters from multiline strings. The assignments to each hot sauce’s <code>description</code> property is done using multiline strings (which are delimited with triple-quotes — <code><span>&#34;&#34;</span>&#34;</code>) to make the code easier to read.</p><h4 id="What-s-With-the-Numbers-">What’s With the Numbers?</h4><p>You may have noticed that some of the numbers in the code contain underscore characters, such as on this line of code for the final sauce in the list:</p><pre><code>heat <span>=</span> <span>669_000</span></code></pre><p>Kotlin — like some other languages, including Python, Ruby, and Swift — ignores undescore characters in numbers. This allows you to use them the way we typically use “separator characters” to make numbers easier to read.</p><p>For example, in the U.S., we tend to write the number for “one million” as <strong>1,000,000</strong>, which is easier to read than 1000000. In India, the preference is to write this number as <strong>10,00,000</strong>, and in some countries in Europe, it’s <strong>1.000.000</strong>. By allowing the underscore as the grouping character for numbers and ignoring it, Kotlin lets you group digits in numbers as you see fit.</p><h2 id="Trying-Out-the-API">Trying Out the API</h2><p>You’re now ready to take the API for a trial run!</p><p>🌶 Run the application by opening a terminal if you’re on macOS of Linux or opening PowerShell if you’re on Windows), navigating to the the application’s directory, and entering the following command:</p><pre><code>./gradlew bootRun</code></pre><p>This command was included in the set of files that Spring Initilizr generated. It sets Gradle in motion, causing it to download any needed plugins and dependencies, after which it launches the application.</p><p>When it starts, you’ll see a lot of status messages. Eventually, they’ll end with this:</p><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> :bootRun</code></pre><p>If you don’t see an error message and the last line of the output is <code><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>bootRun</code>, it means that the project is running properly and listening to <strong>localhost:8080</strong> for incoming requests. You can now start making API calls.</p><h3 id="Is-this-thing-on-">Is this thing on?</h3><p>One of the dependencies that you included when setting up this project with Spring Initializr was Spring Boot Actuator. This automatically adds a number of endpoints to your application that let you monitor and interact with it.</p><p>Let’s use Actuator’s <code>health</code> endpoint to get client-side confirmation that your application is up and running.</p><p>🌶 <strong>If you’re on macOS or Linux,</strong> enter this into Terminal:</p><pre><code><span>curl</span> <span>&#34;http://localhost:8080/actuator/health&#34;</span></code></pre><p>🌶 <strong>If you’re on Windows,</strong> enter this into PowerShell:</p><pre><code>Invoke<span>-</span>RestMethod <span>&#34;http://localhost:8080/actuator/health&#34;</span></code></pre><p>macOS and Linux users should see this response...</p><pre><code><span>{</span><span>&#34;status&#34;</span><span>:</span><span>&#34;UP&#34;</span><span>}</span></code></pre><p>...while Windows users should see this:</p><pre><code>status

All its endpoints are available to anyone with the URL and the ability to send HTTP requests.</p><p>Suppose that we want to allow only authorized applications to have access to the endpoints of the API that allow accessing, adding, editing, and deleting hot sauces. The remaining endpoints — the test endpoint and the one that reports the number of hot sauces — can remain generally available.</p><p>You’ll use Auth0 to secure the API’s CRUD endpoints, but before that happens, let’s take a look at how API authentication works.</p><h3 id="The-Nightclub-Metaphor">The Nightclub Metaphor</h3><p>There’s no shortage of essays and articles on the internet that try to explain API authentication. Let’s make it a little more fun and easier to grasp way by using The Nightclub Metaphor!</p><p>A number of nightclubs have a two-step process to control who gets in and who doesn’t. First, there’s an initial phase where the club-goer goes to a window and shows some ID...</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/6oCWbsxHYlaAJXpelHJOS1/6d7fd315a5bb60f932be7c765f198106/mclovin_drivers_license.png" alt="A fake ID"/></p><p>...and if the ID passes inspection, the club-goer is given something that’s easy to see in a nightclub environment. Often, it’s a wristband:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/3antgKjLDw9hqJ93J97thU/7199be675a2da2164ab71fc4532831ad/wristbands.png" alt="Club wristbands"/></p><p>The wristband is visible permission — an <em>access token</em> — that the club-goer wearing it has been cleared to enter the club. In order to be let into the club, the club-goer has to show their wristband to the bouncers guarding the entrance.</p><p>The better-run nightclubs change their wristbands every night. One night, it’ll be blue, and on the next night, it’ll be a different color. This prevents club-goers from reusing the previous night’s wristband to get in.</p><p>API security with Auth0 works in a similar way:</p><ul><li><strong>Showing ID at the window:</strong> You first assemble a set of credentials, which you submit to Auth0’s servers to obtain an access token.</li><li><strong>Showing your wristband to the bouncers:</strong> When accessing an API endpoint that requires authorization, you include the access token as part of your request. The API communicates with Auth0 to validate the access token, and if it’s valid, provides the response to your request.</li><li><strong>Changing wristbands every night:</strong> Like the wristbands at the better-run nightclubs, access tokens aren’t valid forever. By default, Auth0 access tokens expire 24 hours after they’re issued.</li></ul><p>It’s time to secure the API. This needs to be done both on the Auth0 side as well as in the application.</p><h2 id="Setting-Up-API-Authentication-on-the-Auth0-Side">Setting Up API Authentication on the Auth0 Side</h2><h3 id="Registering-the-API">Registering the API</h3><p>The first step in setting up API authentication is to register it.</p><p>🌶 Log into Auth0.</p><blockquote><p>If you don’t have an Auth0 account yet, go ahead and <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up for a free one.</a> You’ll find it useful for prototyping logins and API security in your projects.</p></blockquote><p>🌶 Once you’ve logged in, <a href="https://manage.auth0.com/?&amp;_ga=2.55268258.821728906.1599742219-782382229.1597890849#/apis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">navigate to the <em>APIs</em> page</a>...</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/48uwB1BEZbrHDz9zzeRWxO/4add50dd5a0b7317b991fd3fe1a413da/apis.png" alt="Auth0 dashboard APIs page"/></p><p>🌶 ...and click the <strong>Create API</strong> button located near the upper right corner of the page.

These classes enable the application to make use of Auth0’s OAuth2 authorization.</p><p>Since these classes don’t directly have anything to do with the application’s main functionality, they’re often put into their own directory.</p><p>🌶 Create a new directory, <strong>security</strong>, as a subdirectory of <strong>/src/main/kotlin/com/auth0/hotsauces/</strong>.

The entire concept of design patterns revolves around <em>classes</em> and <em>objects</em>. The design patterns are more high-level solutions for commonly occurring problems. They are like the blueprint to solve a specific problem. They are not confined to a single programming language. You can use design patterns in any programming language that supports object-oriented programming; the process will be the same while the syntax changes.

There are several types of design patterns, including <strong>Creational</strong>, <strong>Structural</strong>, and <strong>Behavioral</strong> patterns. Creational patterns are about different ways to create objects that increase the flexibility of our code. Structural patterns are about relations between the objects, making larger structures flexible using objects and classes. Behavioral patterns are about effective communications and interactions between objects.</p><h2 id="Strategy">Strategy</h2><p><strong>Strategy Pattern</strong> is a design pattern that enables our application to select algorithms at runtime, making our application flexible. The original book on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">design patterns</a> written by <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?GangOfFour" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GoF</a> states that &#34;Strategy pattern intends to define a family of algorithms, <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/strategy-design-pattern-in-python/shorturl.at/rHJR7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">encapsulates</a> each one, and
make them interchangeable.&#34; More specifically, it lets you define a set of algorithms that are interchangeable according to some factors at runtime. Strategy Pattern falls under the category of behavioral design patterns as it enables an algorithm&#39;s behavior to be selected at runtime.</p><h2 id="Usage">Usage</h2><p>While developing software applications, you may have a few alternatives to accomplish something in your code. Depending on your client choices, data sources, or other factors, you want to do something different without changing the code. You often tend to define algorithms using conditional statements for different situations in the main class of the code. But it is not an elegant way of writing better code. It makes the main class of your code quite long, and it becomes too hard to maintain the application.</p><p>In situations like these, the strategy pattern is an ideal solution. The strategy pattern suggests you define classes, called <em>strategies</em>, for your algorithms of different situations. The strategy is referenced inside the main class, called <em>context</em>, and the code works according to that situation. The context does not select an appropriate strategy for the case. Instead, the client passes the desired strategy to the context.</p><p>For example, if you have a chess application, you can select the difficulty level between easy, medium, or hard. The computer chooses an algorithm according to the level you choose. It is one of the best examples where the strategy pattern is used.</p><p>Strategy pattern follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open/close principle</a>; a software application is open for extension but closed for modification. It means you can add any number of additional strategies without modifying the main class. It makes your code more flexible and easy to maintain.</p><h2 id="UML-Diagrams">UML Diagrams</h2><p>The following is the UML diagram of the Strategy pattern.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/21fvYspoS3Voqv7pKyDE4E/e89c3e5f81d51b3d15a436cd81e795f7/02_UML-Strategy.jpg" alt="UML Strategy"/></p><ol start="1"><li><strong>Context</strong> — It is the primary class of our application. It maintains a reference to one of the concrete strategies.</li><li><strong>Strategy</strong> — Strategy interface is common to all supported strategies. Context can communicate with other strategies only through the strategy interface.</li><li><strong>ConcreteStrategies</strong> — These are the classes that implement the algorithm using the Strategy interface.</li></ol><h2 id="Implementation">Implementation</h2><p>Let&#39;s see the step-by-step process of implementing a strategy pattern.</p><ol start="1"><li>You should first identify algorithms you want to execute as concrete strategies in the primary class.</li><li>Define the <em>context</em> (primary class) and add a reference to the strategy, a method to set the strategy, and another method to execute the strategy.

You can build flexible and maintainable software applications using the strategy pattern. You can switch between algorithms at runtime according to the user&#39;s decision without changing the code. But if your code only has a couple of algorithms, there is no need to use strategy. It just makes your code look complex with numerous classes and objects. The Strategy pattern can work as an alternative for conditional statements for selecting the behavior of the application. But the potential drawback of strategy pattern is that the users must know how strategies differ from each other to select what they need. So it would be best if you use the strategy pattern only when the variation in behavior of the application is relevant to the users. So try to make your software applications flexible using the strategy pattern.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Developer Day Helps Developers Build the Future of Identity</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/developerday-helps-developers-build-the-future-of-identity/</link>
      <description>What is Developer Day? Developer Advocate, Ben Dechrai, explores the lineup and shares his thoughts from a delegate&#39;s perspective.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You’ve probably heard by now that <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/developers-explore-okta-auth0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Okta and Auth0 have joined forces</a>. As a developer advocate for Auth0, I’m really excited to see how we can combine our forces to make identity even better for the developer community.</p><p>You might not be aware that I’m a huge fan of creating events that directly address the needs of developer communities. From the first conference I ran in 2004 to the user group meetings that are still going to this day, you can imagine my excitement when I heard we (Auth0 and Okta) were going to run an online event together!</p><p>This time, members of my team are taking the lead, so I&#39;ll be in the same boat as many of you experiencing Developer Day as it happens, so I thought it might be helpful to share my thoughts on the event and what I’m looking forward to the most.</p><p>Hit up the <a href="http://community.auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a> if I miss something that’s important to you — there’s so much for everyone, I’m sure you’ll help others out too.</p><h2 id="What-Is-Developer-Day-">What Is Developer Day?</h2><p><a href="https://www.okta.com/developerday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Developer Day</a> creates a space for all developers to discover how the identity space is evolving, learn best practices in privacy and security, and gain insights from developer experiences. It brings speakers from across these sectors right to your desktop, and best of all — it’s free!</p><blockquote><p>Speaking of free, did you know you can also <a href="https://auth0.com/signup" data-amp-replace="CLIENT_ID" data-amp-addparams="anonId=CLIENT_ID(cid-scope-cookie-fallback-name)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up for a free Auth0 account</a> at any time? Why not try it out today?</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/12g1Ga4gP8X04Xn0H0nnFt/5b4ae4b06847a028d9a784a46ec48b26/cassidy-alyssa-kapehe.png" alt="Developer Day speakers Cassidy Williams, Alyssa Miller, and Kapehe"/></p><p>More specifically, it’s a one-day, single-track, virtual event, and while I’m proud to see some of my colleagues’ names in the speaker list, the lineup also features the likes of <strong>Cassidy Williams</strong> (Director of Developer Experience at Netlify), <strong>Alyssa Miller</strong> (Hacker, Researcher, and Security Advocate), and <strong>Kapehe</strong> (Developer Relations at Sanity.io, and yes, you might remember she used to <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/authors/kapehe-jorgenson/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">work at Auth0</a> too).</p><h2 id="What-Can-I-Learn-">What Can I Learn?</h2><p>The first place I tend to go when looking at an event is the agenda, and skimming over this one, we’re in for a breadth and depth of information.</p><p>The keynote is where the day’s journey starts, and Alyssa’s <strong>updates from the world of cyber security</strong> are sure to offer a great insight that sets the foundation for the day. I’m a huge advocate for helping all developers understand security principles and states of play. Even if you never have to deal with part of it yourself, you’ll always benefit from knowing why something is done and how you’re being protected.</p><h2 id="From-APIs-to-IoT--Live-Demos-and-Security-Fundamentals">From APIs to IoT: Live Demos and Security Fundamentals</h2><p>From there, we meander down a path from securing Python APIs to securing your Home Automation and IoT devices. Personally, I’m a sucker for anything IoT-related, so I’ll be paying attention to this one.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/hd4kE3aQJFlX45nvwu3xF/6496580a2a7c7da50a6591f781035097/aaron-vittorio.png" alt="Developer Day speakers Aaron Parecki and Vittorio Bertocci"/></p><p>Having grown up on YouTube videos (okay, I’m not that young...) about identity from both Aaron Parecki (or as I like to call him, Mr OAuth, but don’t tell him I told you) and Vittorio Bertocci (the man whose identity knowledge is dwarfed only by his magnificent hair), what better than a talk from both of them? The talk will not only cover where we’ve come from, but what the future of OAuth has in store for us.</p><h2 id="Advanced-Topics-like-Verifiable-Credentials-and-Integration-with-Third-Parties">Advanced Topics like Verifiable Credentials and Integration with Third Parties</h2><p>But identity isn’t just about logging in and loading your glamour shot from Gravatar. I just recently learned about verifiable credentials, and wow - it’s such a powerful concept with so many use cases, I just can’t even! The topic deserves its own article, but one example is around payments, and Uchi Uchibeke’s talk is going to be fascinating, to be sure.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/71FxWB7JqseFrDM9mF63Go/bd98bfcda1f9662b1c7de0bfab486599/uchi.png" alt="Developer Day speaker Uchi Uchibeke"/></p><p>Uchi is flanked by demos on integrating Auth0 with NextJS for securing your webapps and Okta with Kong for securing continuous integration, delivery, and deployment. I think this highlights that the team who worked on the agenda really put a lot of thought into the balance between talks that can have immediate benefit to us developers, as well as enough advanced topics to keep our creative juices flowing.</p><p>Talking of immediately applicable information, if you want to learn how to validate REST API authentication and authorization, the JFrog talk is for you.</p><h2 id="Authentication-in-Gaming-and-Extended-Realities">Authentication in Gaming and Extended Realities</h2><p>If you thought the IoT talk was a bit out of the box, the Gaming and XR talk might just be in a whole other room! Not literally. I mean — it’s a virtual event. There aren’t any rooms. There aren’t any boxes either, for that matter. I digress.</p><p>I won’t admit to being a huge gamer. I load up Poly Bridge 2 every now and then. Does Minesweeper count? One thing I do know, though, is that the authentication experience in games can be awful, and when you get into any extended reality (XR), well. Let’s not go there.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/2REEADn8ARvYmok2WNAt5O/9185928ac397dced701f3cb2d252e4b9/nick.png" alt="Developer Day speaker Nick Gamb"/></p><p>We’ll let Okta&#39;s Nick Gamb go there instead, as he tells us about the propensity for this industry to be targeted by hackers. Follow his advice, and maybe we can all keep playing in the knowledge that our Minedimes are safe. (See — I told you I’m not a huge gamer.)</p><h2 id="Adding-Pixie-Dust-to-Enhance-Security">Adding Pixie Dust to Enhance Security</h2><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/2tBAGZHtBlb4Dt1P21WzAS/2cd4c6438265b64c39bb39b89e6945b9/milecia.png" alt="Developer Day speaker Milecia McGregor"/></p><p>With two talks left for the day, I’m personally keen to catch Milecia McGregor from Mediavine talk about pixies! Stop it, autocorrect. PKCE! While most SDKs magically hide away much of the implementation, it’s still worth understanding how authentication flows work and how they can be improved. The most common OAuth flow is debatably the Authcode flow, but PKCE makes it even better! Come along to find out how. I’ll be at the front taking notes.</p><h2 id="Closing-Keynote">Closing Keynote</h2><p>It’s a packed event — thank goodness there are a couple of breaks during the day — and we finish with a closing keynote from Cassidy Williams. The agenda teases us with the mere existence of this session, and perhaps we’ll find out more before the event. In any case, I’ll not be missing it.</p><p>Tell us in the <a href="http://community.auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a> what you’re looking forward to the most, and I hope to see some of you in the chat room on the day!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Here’s Something New for You: Identity OS</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/here-s-something-new-for-you-identity-os/</link>
      <description>Introducing the new way to think about and build identity</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Authentication has become so much more than just a login box.</p><p>Sure, that’s still what consumers see when they are eagerly clicking towards whatever pizza, handbag, or Playstation pre-sale link they want to get to ASAP.</p><p>But it’s the expectation around what is happening when they click that has increased. Consumers demand the convenience of a seamless login but also want to know that their card details are secure and that their identity is protected against any breaches of privacy.</p><p>In the past, it was about trade-offs. But consumers don’t expect trade-offs, so that’s why we wanted to develop an identity operating system that lets everyone —  from IT teams to devs — build authentication that works now and with whatever the future throws at it.</p><p>Okay, So That’s Why We Need a New Way, but...</p><h2 id="What-Is-an-Identity-OS-">What Is an Identity OS?</h2><p>The Auth0 identity operating system (identity OS) is a cloud-native, adaptable platform for development teams. Built with extensible building blocks, the Auth0 identity OS enables organizations to manage the complexities of today’s identity management while also prioritizing the security, privacy, and convenience of their end-users. </p><p>Striking the perfect balance among these priorities requires identity to integrate a myriad of different services and creates a significant integration hurdle. Identity ecosystem operators can now manage these complex integration needs with the flexibility of full-spectrum code (pro-code, low-code, and no code solutions). </p><p>Customizing to the requirements of different development teams removes their need to focus on identity infrastructure when building differentiated applications. This level of adaptability is a huge benefit for enterprises that are confronted with converging use cases and managing the eroding lines between identity for employees, business partners, and consumers.</p><p>Sounds good, but...</p><h2 id="What-s-the-Three-Benefits-I-Should-Really-Care-About-">What’s the Three Benefits I Should Really Care About?</h2><h3 id="1--It-s-all-about-adaptability">1.

With the explosion of consumer-friendly services made possible through digital applications, consumer expectations are constantly changing. That beautiful Netflix UX is what they expect from everything (even public sector services these days are stepping their game up). So the Auth0 identity OS is built to be as adaptable as your business needs to be, without forcing you into clunky legacy features that you will take years to strip out.</p><h3 id="2--We-re-living-in-a-modular-world">2.

      <title>Deployment Strategies In Kubernetes</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/deployment-strategies-in-kubernetes/</link>
      <description>Learn what are the different deployment strategies available in Kubernetes and how to use them.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> In this article, we will learn what are the deployment strategies while deploying containers using Kubernetes container-orchestration system. At the end of this article, we will have learned how to do deployment using different ways in Kubernetes cluster. If you find this topic interesting, keep reading! 
The code for this tutorial is available here on <a href="https://github.com/akhil90s/auth0/tree/main/Deployment%20Strategies%20In%20Kubernetes/Declarative%20Templates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Github</a></p><h2 id="Quick-Introduction-to-Kubernetes">Quick Introduction to Kubernetes</h2><p>With containerization gaining popularity over time and revolutionizing the process of building, shipping, and maintaining applications, there was a need to effectively manage these containers. Many container orchestration tools were introduced to manage the lifecycle of these containers in large-scale systems.</p><p>Kubernetes is one such orchestration tool that takes care of provisioning and deployment, allocation of resources, load balancing, service discovery, providing high availability, and other important aspects of any system. With this platform, we can decompose our applications into smaller systems (called microservices) while developing; then, we can compose (or orchestrate) these systems together while deploying. </p><p>The adoption of cloud-native approach has increased development of applications based on microservice architecture. For such applications, one of the biggest challenges organizations face is deployment. Having a proper strategy in terms of deployment is necessary. In Kubernetes, there are different ways to release an application; it is necessary to choose the right strategy to make your infrastructure reliable during an application deployment or update. For instance, in a production environment, it is always required to ensure that end-user shouldn&#39;t experience any downtime. In Kubernetes orchestration, right strategy ensures proper management of different versions of container images. To sum up, this article will mainly be around the different deployment strategies in Kubernetes.</p><h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><p>To follow along with this article, we will need some previous experience with Kubernetes. If new to this platform, kindly check out the <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/kubernetes-tutorial-step-by-step-introduction-to-basic-concepts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Step by Step Introduction to Basic Kubernetes Concepts</a> tutorial. There, you can learn everything you need to follow the instructions here. We would also recommend going through the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes documentation</a> if and when required.</p><p>Besides that, we will need kubectl, a Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool that will enable us to control your cluster from a terminal. If you don&#39;t have this tool, check the instructions on the <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/kubernetes-tutorial-step-by-step-introduction-to-basic-concepts/#Installing.Kube.Control..kubectl." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Installing Kube Control (kubectl)</a>.We will also need a basic understanding of Linux and YAML.</p><h2 id="What-Is-A-Deployment-In-Kubernetes-">What Is A Deployment In Kubernetes?</h2><p>A Deployment is a resource object in Kubernetes that defines the desired state for our program. Deployments are declarative, meaning that we don&#39;t dictate how to achieve the state. Instead, we declare the desired state and allow the Deployment-controller to automatically reach that end goal in the most efficient way. A deployment allows us to describe an application&#39;s life cycle, such as which images to use for the app, the number of pods there should be, and the way in which they should be updated.</p><h2 id="Benefits-Of-Using-Kubernetes-Deployment">Benefits Of Using Kubernetes Deployment</h2><p>The process of manually updating containerized applications can be time consuming and tedious. A Kubernetes deployment makes this process automated and repeatable. Deployments are entirely managed by the Kubernetes backend, and the whole update process is performed on the server side without client interaction.</p><p>Moreover, the Kubernetes deployment controller is always monitoring the health of pods and nodes. It replaces a failed pod or bypass down nodes, ensuring continuity of critical applications.</p><h2 id="Deployment-Strategies">Deployment Strategies</h2><h3 id="Rolling-Update-Deployment">Rolling Update Deployment</h3><p>The rolling deployment is the default deployment strategy in Kubernetes. It replaces pods, one by one, of the previous version of our application with pods of the new version without any cluster downtime. A rolling deployment slowly replaces instances of the previous version of an application with instances of the new version of the application.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/LxDl5amQZC2znii0JLZuw/87f42c35b5ba35ac1550f572d23ba943/01_rolling-deployment.jpg" alt="Alt text"/></p><p>When using the RollingUpdate strategy, there are two more options that let us fine-tune the update process:</p><ol start="1"><li><p><strong>maxSurge</strong>: 
The number of pods that can be created above the desired amount of pods during an update. This can be an absolute number or percentage of the replicas count. The default is 25%.</p></li><li><p><strong>maxUnavailable</strong>: 
The number of pods that can be unavailable during the update process. This can be an absolute number or a percentage of the replicas count; the default is 25%.</p></li></ol><p>First, we create our <em>rollingupdate.yaml</em> deployment template. In the template below, we set <em>maxSurge</em> to 2 and <em>maxUnavailable</em> to 1.</p><pre><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> apps/v1

          <span>image</span><span>:</span> hello<span>-</span>world<span>:</span>nanoserver<span>-</span><span>1709</span></code></pre><p>We can then create the deployment using the kubectl command.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl apply <span>-</span>f rollingupdate<span>.</span>yaml</code></pre><p>Once we have a deployment template, we can provide a way to access the instances of the deployment by creating a Service. Note that we are deploying the image <em>hello-world</em> with version <em>nanoserver-1709</em>. So in this case we have two labels, &#39;name= <em>web-app-rollingupdate-strategy</em>&#39; and &#39;version=<em>nanoserver-1709</em>&#39;. We will set these as the label selector for the service below. Save this to &#39;<em>service.yaml</em>&#39; file.</p><pre><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> v1
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> Service

    <span>version</span><span>:</span> nanoserver<span>-</span><span>1709</span>
  <span>type</span><span>:</span> LoadBalancer</code></pre><p>Now creating the service will create a load balancer that is accessible outside the cluster.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl apply <span>-</span>f service<span>.</span>yaml</code></pre><p>Run <em>kubectl get deployments</em> to check if the Deployment is created. If the Deployment is still being created, the output should be similar to the following:</p><pre><code>$ kubectl <span>get</span> deployments

<span>NAME</span>                             <span>READY</span>   <span>UP</span><span>-</span><span>TO</span><span>-</span><span>DATE</span>   <span>AVAILABLE</span>   <span>AGE</span>

The output should be similar to this:</p><pre><code>$ kubectl <span>get</span> deployments

The output should be similar to this:</p><pre><code>$ kubectl <span>get</span> rs

The created ReplicaSet ensures that there are three Pods running. The output should be similar to the below.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl <span>get</span> pods

Then update the image of the existing running deployment using the kubectl command.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl <span>set</span> image deployment<span>/</span>rollingupdate<span>-</span>strategy web<span>-</span>app<span>-</span>rollingupdate<span>-</span>strategy<span>=</span>hello<span>-</span>world<span>:</span>nanoserver<span>-</span><span>1809</span> <span>--</span>record</code></pre><p>The output is similar to the below.</p><pre><code>deployment<span>.</span>apps<span>/</span>rollingupdate<span>-</span>strategy image updated</code></pre><p>We are now deploying the image <em>hello-world</em> with version <em>nanoserver-1809</em>. So, in this case, we will have to update the labels in the &#39;<em>service.yaml</em>&#39;. The label will be updated to &#39;version=<em>nanoserver-1809</em>&#39;. We will run the below kubectl command again to update the service so that it can pick new pods running on the newer image.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl apply <span>-</span>f service<span>.</span>yaml</code></pre><p>To see the rollout status run the kubectl command below.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl rollout status deployment<span>/</span>rollingupdate<span>-</span>strategy

deployment <span>&#34;rollingupdate-strategy&#34;</span> successfully rolled out</code></pre><p>After the rollout is successful, we can view the Deployment by running the command <em>kubectl get deployments</em>. The output is similar to this:</p><pre><code>$ kubectl <span>get</span> deployments

<span>NAME</span>                             <span>READY</span>   <span>UP</span><span>-</span><span>TO</span><span>-</span><span>DATE</span>   <span>AVAILABLE</span>   <span>AGE</span>

We can use it to check how our deployment is doing. The command, by default, waits until all of the Pods in the deployment have been started successfully. When the deployment succeeds, the command exits with return code zero to indicate success. If the deployment fails, the command exits with a non-zero code.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl rollout status deployment rollingupdate<span>-</span>strategy

Waiting <span>for</span> deployment <span>&#34;rollingupdate-strategy&#34;</span> rollout to finish<span>:</span> <span>0</span> <span>of</span> <span>3</span> updated replicas are available…
Waiting <span>for</span> deployment <span>&#34;rollingupdate-strategy&#34;</span> rollout to finish<span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>of</span> <span>3</span> updated replicas are available…
Waiting <span>for</span> deployment <span>&#34;rollingupdate-strategy&#34;</span> rollout to finish<span>:</span> <span>2</span> <span>of</span> <span>3</span> updated replicas are available…

deployment <span>&#34;rollingupdate-strategy&#34;</span> successfully rolled out</code></pre><p>If the deployment fails in Kubernetes, the deployment process stops, but the pods from the failed deployment are kept around. On deployment failure, our environment may contain pods from both the old and new deployments. To get back to a stable, working state, we can use the rollout undo command to bring back the working pods and clean up the failed deployment.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl rollout undo deployment rollingupdate<span>-</span>strategy

deployment<span>.</span>extensions<span>/</span>rollingupdate<span>-</span>strategy</code></pre><p>Then we will verify the status of the deployment again.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl rollout status deployment rollingupdate<span>-</span>strategy

deployment <span>&#34;rollingupdate-strategy&#34;</span> successfully rolled out</code></pre><p>In order for Kubernetes to know when an application is ready, it needs some help from the application. Kubernetes uses readiness probes to examine how the application is doing. Once an application instance starts responding to the readiness probe with a positive response, the instance is considered ready for use. Readiness probes tell Kubernetes when an application is ready, but not if the application will ever become ready. If the application keeps failing, it may never respond with a positive response to Kubernetes. </p><p>A rolling deployment typically waits for new pods to become ready via a readiness check before scaling down the old components. If a significant issue occurs, the rolling deployment can be aborted. If there is a problem, the rolling update or deployment can be aborted without bringing the whole cluster down.</p><h3 id="Recreate-Deployment">Recreate Deployment</h3><p>In recreate deployment, we fully scale down the existing application version before we scale up the new application version. In the below diagram, Version 1 represents the current application version, and Version 2 represents the new application version. When updating the current application version, we first scale down the existing replicas of Version 1 to zero and then concurrently deploy replicas with the new version.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/1FVQm06ERSn67QJkI2zlfj/49ef78e46445aa7e6a7e54349e85e2b7/02_recreate-deployment.jpg" alt="Alt text"/></p><p>The below template shows deployment using the recreate strategy: First, we create our <em>recreate</em> deployment by saving the following yaml to a file recreate.yaml</p><pre><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> apps/v1

Downtime is not an issue for applications that can handle maintenance windows or outages. However, if there is a mission-critical application with high service level agreements (SLAs) and availability requirements, choosing a different deployment strategy would be the right approach. Recreate deployment is generally used in the development stage by the developers as it is easy to set up, and the application state is entirely renewed with the new version. What&#39;s more, we don&#39;t have to manage more than one application version in parallel, and therefore we avoid backward compatibility challenges for data and applications. </p><h3 id="Blue-Green-Deployment">Blue-Green Deployment</h3><p>In a blue/green deployment strategy (sometimes also referred to as red/black), the blue represents the current application version, and green represents the new application version. In this, only one version is live at a time. Traffic is routed to the blue deployment while the green deployment is created and tested. After we are finished testing, we then route traffic to the new version.</p><p>After the deployment succeeds, we can either keep the blue deployment for a possible rollback or decommission it. Alternatively, it is possible to deploy a newer version of the application on these instances. In that case, the current (blue) environment serves as the staging area for the next release.</p><p>This technique can eliminate downtime as we faced in the recreate deployment strategy. In addition, blue-green deployment reduces risk: if something unexpected happens with our new version on Green, we can immediately roll back to the last version by switching back to Blue. There is instant rollout/rollback. We can also avoid versioning issues; the entire application state is changed in one deployment.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/5vHYgyomFFI2h4okBQyUTH/98d685900acef7c6c1abdea444b947e1/03_blue-green.jpg" alt="Alt text"/></p><p>The Blue-Green deployment is expensive as it requires double the resources. A proper test of the entire platform should be done before releasing it to production. Moreover, handling stateful applications is hard.</p><p>First, we create our <em>blue</em> deployment by saving the following yaml to a &#39;blue.yaml&#39; file:</p><pre><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> apps/v1

          <span>image</span><span>:</span> hello<span>-</span>world<span>:</span>nanoserver<span>-</span><span>1709</span></code></pre><p>We can then create the deployment using the kubectl command.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl apply <span>-</span>f blue<span>.</span>yaml</code></pre><p>Once we have a deployment template, we can provide a way to access the instances of the deployment by creating a Service. Note that we are deploying the image <em>hello-world</em> with version <em>nanoserver-1809</em>. So in this case we have two labels, &#39;name= <em>blue-deployment</em>&#39; and &#39;version=<em>nanoserver-1709</em>&#39;. We will set these as the label selector for the service below. Save this to <em>service.yaml</em> file.</p><pre><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> v1

          <span>image</span><span>:</span> hello<span>-</span>world<span>:</span>nanoserver<span>-</span><span>1809</span></code></pre><p>Note that image <em>hello-world:nanoserver-1809</em> tag-name has changed to 2. So we have made a separate deployment with two labels, name= <em>green-deployment</em> and version=<em>nanoserver-1809</em>.</p><pre><code>$ kubectl apply <span>-</span>f green<span>.</span>yaml</code></pre><p>To cut over to the <em>green</em> deployment, we will update the selector for the existing service. Edit the service.yaml and change the selector version to <em>2</em> and name to <em>green-deployemnt</em>. That will make it so that it matches the pods on the <em>green</em>&#34; deployment.</p><pre><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> v1
<span>kind</span><span>:</span> Service

All users will receive the update at the same time, although existing sessions will be allowed to finish their work on the old instances. Hence the stakes are a bit higher than everything should work once we initiate the change. It also requires allocating more server resources since we will need to run two copies of every pod.</p><p>Fortunately, the rollback procedure is just as easy: We simply have to flip the switch again, and the previous version is swapped back into place. That&#39;s because the old version is still running on the old pods. It is simply that traffic is no longer being routed to them. When we are confident that the new version is here to stay, we should decommission those pods.</p><h3 id="Canary-Deployment">Canary Deployment</h3><p>The canary update strategy is a partial update process that allows us to test our new program version on a real user base without a commitment to a full rollout. Similar to blue/green deployments, but they are more controlled, and they use a more progressive delivery where deployment is in a phased approach. There are a number of strategies that fall under the umbrella of canary, including dark launches or A/B testing.</p><p>In canary deployment, the new version of the application is gradually deployed to the Kubernetes cluster while getting a very small amount of live traffic (i.e., a subset of live users are connecting to the new version while the rest are still using the previous version).In this approach, we have two almost identical servers: one that goes to all the current active users and another with the new features that gets rolled out to a subset of users and then compared. When no errors are reported and the confidence increases, the new version can gradually roll out to the rest of the infrastructure. In the end, all live traffic goes to canaries, making the canary version the new <em>production version</em>.</p><p>The below picture shows the most straightforward and simple way to do a canary deployment. A new version is deployed to a subset of servers.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/4thRldlIQuLdnmwSjEcmIq/85ed566fcaa6038e74de978112a79df0/06_canary-deployment-1.jpg" alt="Alt text"/></p><p>While this happens, we watch how the upgraded machines are doing. We check for errors and performance problems, and we listen for user feedback. As we grow confident in the canary, we continue installing it on the rest of the machines until they are all running the latest release.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/4dsHDsWT30QXUL17T0uphC/5048ee861491e78ae2baa43682446a83/07_canary-deployment-2.png" alt="Alt text"/></p><p>We have to take into account various things when planning a canary deployment:</p><ol start="1"><li><strong>Stages</strong>: how many users will we send to the canary at first, and in how many stages.</li><li><strong>Duration</strong>: how long will we plan to run the canary? Canary releases are different, as we must wait for enough clients to be updated before we can assess the results. This can happen over several days or even weeks.</li><li><strong>Metrics</strong>: what are the metrics to record to analyze progress, including application performance and error reports? Well-chosen parameters are essential for a successful canary deployment. For instance, a very simple way to measure deployment is through HTTP status codes. We can have a simple ping service that returns 200 when the deployment is successful. It will return server end error (5xx) if there is an issue in the deployment.</li><li><strong>Evaluation</strong>: what criteria will we use to determine if the canary is successful</li></ol><p>A canary is used in scenarios where we have to test a new functionality typically on the backend of our application. Canary deployment should be used when we are not 100% confident in the new version; we predict we might have a low chance of failure. This strategy is usually used when we have a major update, like adding a new functionality or experimental feature.</p><h2 id="Summary-K8s-Deployments-Strategies">Summary K8s Deployments Strategies</h2><p>To sum up, there are different ways to deploy an application; when releasing to development/staging environments, a recreate or ramped deployment is usually a good choice. When it comes to production, a ramped or blue/green deployment is usually a good fit, but proper testing of the new platform is necessary. If we are not confident with the stability of the platform and what could be the impact of releasing a new software version, then a canary release should be the way to go. By doing so, we let the consumer test the application and its integration into the platform. In this article, we have only scratched the surface of the capabilities of Kubernetes deployments. By combining deployments with all the other Kubernetes features, users can create more robust containerized applications to suit any need.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> This article demonstrates the use of LocalStack and how it can simulate many of the AWS services locally. We will use Spring Cloud Messaging to create a publisher-subscriber sample application. We will use Amazon SNS and SQS to do that.</p><p>The sample app can be found <a href="https://github.com/maniish-jaiin/spring-cloud-messaging-sample" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><h2 id="Spring-Cloud-Messaging-With-AWS-and-LocalStack">Spring Cloud Messaging With AWS and LocalStack</h2><h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3><p>With an ever-growing demand for cloud services, Spring provides amazing support to integrate with Cloud providers and relevant services. <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-aws" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring Cloud for Amazon Web Services</a> is one such project that makes it easy to integrate with AWS services using familiar Spring APIs.</p><p>In this article, we will look into a simple application that acts as a message producer and a consumer using Amazon SNS and SQS. On top of that, we will not create an AWS account or use AWS services directly from AWS. We will instead use LocalStack, which will allow us to create AWS resources locally.</p><p>The sample app can be found <a href="https://github.com/maniish-jaiin/spring-cloud-messaging-sample" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><h3 id="Pre-requisites-">Pre-requisites:</h3><ol start="1"><li>Basic knowledge of AWS, <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AWS CLI</a>, and related services like Amazon SQS.</li><li>Basic knowledge of <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Java 11</a> and Spring Boot <code><span>2.4</span><span>.7</span></code>.</li><li><a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker</a> and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker Compose</a> for the setup.</li></ol><h2 id="Introduction-to-Amazon-SNS-and-SQS">Introduction to Amazon SNS and SQS</h2><h3 id="Amazon-SNS">Amazon SNS</h3><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon SNS</a> is an acronym for Simple Notification Service. It provides developers with the highly scalable, cost-effective, and flexible capability to publish messages from an application and send them to other applications. It follows the pub-sub architecture to deliver messages from publishers to the subscribers. It is a highly decoupled service that can be linked to a variety of sources. It can be used to publish emails, messages to SQS, SMS, etc.</p><p>The Publisher (e.g., CloudWatch Alarm, S3 events, SNS, Micro-service) publishes the message on a Topic which is then published to all the Subscribers (web servers, email addresses, Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda)  of that particular topic.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/35P87aEWHIcpTOQxYTGWbz/03840ff6c13fdc4a94552ec8188c131e/sns_architecture.jpg" alt="SNS Architecture"/></p><h3 id="Amazon-SQS">Amazon SQS</h3><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon SQS</a> is an acronym for Simple Queue Service, and the names convey a lot as it is really simple to use as it is a fully managed service from AWS. It follows similar messaging semantics of the producer putting a message on the queue and consumer reading from it.</p><p>Once consumed, the message has to be deleted from the queue. Deleting is important because SQS assumes that processing can fail. To prevent that, after the consumer receives a message, it is hidden from the queue for a defined period of time, and after that, if it is not deleted, the message shows up in the queue again.</p><p>Both SNS and SQS are fully managed lightweight, easy-to-use APIs. You can use Amazon SQS and SNS to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications and improve reliability.</p><h3 id="Introduction-to-LocalStack">Introduction to LocalStack</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/localstack/localstack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LocalStack</a> is an open-source mock of the real AWS services. It provides a testing environment on our local machine with the same APIs as the real AWS services. We switch to using the real AWS services only in the integration environment and beyond. There are plenty of reasons to use LocalStack, few out of which are more important than others, such as:</p><ol start="1"><li>The ability to play with AWS services without interacting with AWS. All developers love to get their hands dirty, and what better way to learn something than to try. Localstack allows you to play with S3, SQS, DynamoDB, SNS, and the list goes on.</li><li>The ability to test the applications in the local dev environment. You can write integration tests for your application using LocalStack, driving down your costs and increasing the confidence in your code.</li></ol><h3 id="Spring-Cloud-Messaging-app-linked-to-LocalStack">Spring Cloud Messaging app linked to LocalStack</h3><p>Spring Cloud AWS provides <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon SQS</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon SNS</a> integration that simplifies the publication and consumption of messages. It reduces a lot of boilerplate code and does the heavy lifting for configuring and SNS and SQS. Let&#39;s set up a Spring boot project with support for SNS and SQS.</p><h4 id="Setting-up-Spring-Boot-app">Setting up Spring Boot app</h4><p>Let us first create a Spring Boot project with the help of the <a href="https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&amp;language=java&amp;platformVersion=2.4.5.RELEASE&amp;packaging=jar&amp;jvmVersion=11&amp;groupId=io.pratik&amp;artifactId=springcloudsqs&amp;name=springcloudsqs&amp;description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20cloud%20sqs&amp;packageName=io.pratik.springcloudsqs&amp;dependencies=web,lombok" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spring boot Initializr</a>, and then open the project in our favorite IDE. Select Maven project and Java language. Last but not least, select Spring boot version <code><span>2.4</span><span>.7</span></code>. Fill in the project metadata and click generate.</p><p>For Spring Cloud, We need to configure Spring Cloud AWS BOM in our <code>pom<span>.</span>xml</code> file using this dependencyManagement block:</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>dependencyManagement</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

      <title>Node 16 Support Now Available in Actions</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/node-16-support-now-available-in-actions/</link>
      <description>Starting Aug 4, 2021, we are rolling out Node 16 as the default runtime for Actions.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As our next-generation extensibility platform, designed to replace Rules &amp; Hooks, our plan is to support every current and long-term supported Node version through Actions exclusively. </p><p>We recently introduced Node 16 support in Actions. Node 16 is the <em><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current version published by Node</a></em>. This version does not introduce any breaking changes.  </p><h2 id="What-Does-This-Mean-for-Our-Developers-">What Does This Mean for Our Developers?</h2><p>We will continue to support Node 12 through the Long Term Support (LTS) end coming in April 2022 for all of our extensibility products - Actions, Rules, and Hooks.  However, we encourage developers to stay current in their Node version for security and compliance purposes.  </p><h3 id="Developers-using-Actions">Developers using Actions</h3><p>All new Actions will be set to the Node 16 runtime by default. However, you do not need to migrate every Action immediately to Node 16.  </p><p>Unlike Rules and Hooks, Actions is designed to run actions of varying Node runtimes side by side. With Actions, you no longer need to migrate all code to a single, tenant-level Node runtime. Existing Actions can be upgraded to Node 16 by creating and <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/actions/manage-versions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deploying a new version</a> to Node 16. If needed, existing Actions built on Node 12 can be upgraded to Node 16 and reverted to Node 12.</p><h3 id="Developers-using-legacy-extensibility-products">Developers using legacy extensibility products</h3><p>Our legacy extensibility products (Rules and Hooks) will continue to support Node 12. Node 16 will only roll out to Actions.</p><p>We strongly encourage developers using Rules and Hooks to migrate to Actions, wherever possible, to start taking advantage of the greatly <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/introducing-auth0-actions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">improved developer experience</a> that comes with Actions, such as an industry standard VS Code style editor, typescript, draft mode, version control, improved secret management, an expanded library of NPM modules, and more. </p><p>For developers using Node 8, if there are Rules and Hooks that cannot be immediately migrated to Actions Node 16, at a minimum, update your code to Node 12.

      <title>Adding Auth0 RBAC Authorization to a Ktor API</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/adding-auth0-rbac-authorization-to-a-ktor-api/</link>
      <description>Learn how to add Auth0 RBAC authorization to Ktor HTTP API endpoints</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the previous post, we created an Auth0 API to represent the Ktor HTTP API and an Auth0 application to allow the frontend application to authenticate users. This allowed us to query the backend API from the frontend application with a valid access token. We also updated the backend API to require a valid access token for the <code><span>protected</span></code> and <code>admin</code> endpoints.</p><p>In this post, we&#39;ll complete the journey by enabling Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC) within Auth0 and restrict access to the <code>admin</code> endpoint in our backend API to those users with the correct permissions.</p><h2 id="RBAC-and-permissions">RBAC and permissions</h2><p>We start by enabling RBAC within our Auth0 API.</p><p>Under the <strong>Settings</strong> tab in the API, switch the <strong>Enable RBAC</strong> and <strong>Add permissions in the Access Token</strong> sliders to the on the setting. Doing so will ensure a <code>permissions</code> claim is added to the access token with any scopes that have been assigned to the logged-in user.</p><p>A detailed discussion on why scopes should not be used to grant permissions is presented in the post <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/on-the-nature-of-oauth2-scopes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">On The Nature of OAuth2&#39;s Scopes</a>. The summary is that a scope constrains the actions that an OAuth client <em>may</em> attempt to perform on behalf of a user, but <em>does not</em> imply that the user has the permission to access any particular resource.</p><p>This has some subtle but significant implications on the claims returned in an Auth0 access token.</p><p>Without enabling the RBAC settings, any scope requested by the OAuth client and consented to by the user will be returned in the <code>scope</code> claim. It doesn&#39;t matter if that scope has been assigned to the user or not - it is returned regardless. It is then the responsibility of the OAuth resource server to allow or deny access to a given resource based on the user&#39;s identity and the action being performed.</p><p>When RBAC is enabled, only scopes that have been requested by the client, <em>and</em> consented to by the user, <em>and</em> assigned to a user will be returned in the <code>scope</code> claim. In this scenario, the resource server can assume the absence of a scope means the client did not request it, the user did not consent to it, or it has not been assigned to the user, and so can quickly deny access.</p><p>By adding the <code>permissions</code> claim, each scope assigned to the user is calculated and included in the access token. The <code>permissions</code> claim is populated without asking for consent from the user, which supports more traditional RBAC style applications, where clients have delegated all the permissions of their users, and the users don&#39;t pick and choose scopes with each login.</p><p>Our sample application will make use of the scopes in the <code>permissions</code> claim to determine access to the API.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/4ZpaxCFDvKa7It8aToFSBP/06e7bd6600e3146032475a399a0d068a/01_build-a-ktor-api-pt-3.png" alt="RBAC"/>
<em>Enabling RBAC and permissions in the access token.</em></p><p>Under the <strong>Permissions</strong> tab, define a new <strong>Permission (Scope)</strong> of <code>read<span>:</span>admin<span>-</span>messages</code> and a <strong>Description</strong> of <strong>The ability to access the admin endpoint</strong>. Click the <strong>Add</strong> button to save the new permission:</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/1DJaaadYXA4vGKV9i9R8LK/4564b6449b1b1d190f2345638431b92d/02_build-a-ktor-api-pt-3.png" alt="API"/>
<em>Creating an API permission.</em></p><h3 id="Creating-the-role">Creating the role</h3><p>We now create a role to hold the permissions required by our API.

    <span>return</span> <span>null</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>We then define a second authentication mechanism called <code>auth0<span>-</span>admin</code> requiring the permission <code>read<span>:</span>admin<span>-</span>messages</code> in order to pass validation:</p><pre><code>    <span>install</span><span>(</span>Authentication<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

By embedding the permissions assigned to a user in the <code>permissions</code> scope and verifying the presence of a known permission for any queries to the <code>admin</code> endpoint, we can be sure that only authorized users can access the restricted endpoints in our HTTP API.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>The consumer speaks — how readiness to scale wins the security and privacy battle for the customer</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you sped through your digital road map during the pandemic and are looking to fill security and privacy gaps right now, go back and check out my earlier posts:</p><ul><li><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/accelerated-your-road-map-go-fix-workforce-and-app-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Accelerated Your Road Map? Go Fix Workforce and App Security</a></li><li><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/workforce-and-app-privacy-have-changed-so-should-you" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Workforce and App Privacy Have Changed, So Should You</a></li></ul><p>This post is about making the shift from reaction to preparation so that you are ready for the next moment that requires speed – and set up to scale.</p><h2 id="Find-Your-Balance">Find Your Balance</h2><p>In all of these posts, we mention speed and imply pressure. There is always going to be a business reason to get an app to market as quickly as possible. You will discover vulnerabilities that require your immediate attention. And regulations will set deadlines for you. </p><p>So there is always going to be more you could do to improve security for your customers, your business, and the rest of the internet. Even for veteran security professionals, the pandemic was a reminder that we still need to pick and choose priorities. If you have an internal security team, lean into their expertise. Give them the time and space to guide you on priorities. Listen to their assessments of risk and let them set a pace that works for your business.</p><p>Longer-term security and privacy improvements can have big payoffs. Like the previous posts, these things require action. You’re also going to need to support your existing security team or create one. By support, I mean backing conversations about risks with budget for tools, external vendors, and hiring internal talent.</p><p>If you don’t currently have security or privacy teams, we’ll cover a bit of advice on what to look for as well.</p><h2 id="Consumers-Expect-and-Deserve-Strong-Security-and-Privacy">Consumers Expect and Deserve Strong Security and Privacy</h2><p>Let’s also set some context.</p><p>There was a time when businesses leaned heavily into just shipping the product. Speed often won over security or privacy.</p><blockquote><p>Consumers are telling us that time is over.</p></blockquote><p>In a <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent global survey</a>, McKinsey found that 87% of consumer respondents said security practice concerns would mean they wouldn’t do business with a company, and 71% would stop doing business if it gave away sensitive data without their permission. </p><blockquote><p>The more secure and private app is now the one that keeps and attracts customers. </p></blockquote><h2 id="Security--Longer-Term-Planning">Security: Longer-Term Planning</h2><p>If you’re looking to make a dramatic improvement in your cybersecurity, these best practices will help get you there.</p><ul><li><strong>Increase pen test frequency.</strong> Penetration testing (pen testing) includes hiring an external vendor to test your application and site for vulnerabilities and provide you with a report cataloged by severity. Many companies do this once a year and call it good. In today’s evolving threat environment, that’s not enough. If you can up your pen testing to every quarter — and take action on what you learn — you’ll see a big increase in security. Adding a pen test after every major operating system upgrade, library update, or major code push will do even more.</li><li><strong>Improve your software development life cycle (SLDC).</strong> Many shops are still doing security after the product is completely coded, but this creates an automatic security backlog that can not only slow getting your product to market it can put pressure on your execs to allow unnecessary risks into the wild. Involving security and privacy teams as software is being developed allows them to raise questions that influence architecture before burning hours of engineering time. Few people like to put hours and hours into something only to have to take it apart, so your devs are rarely pleased to see this analysis tacked on at the end of the SLDC., which leads me to my next point.</li><li><strong>Encourage ownership and collaboration between devs and security.</strong> How you introduce the idea of static and dynamic code analysis as well as overall participation of security in the SLDC matters. Explaining that humans are fallible, so all code is going to have vulnerabilities, and there are going to be remote code executions (RCEs) is a good place to start. As a dev, they don’t want RCEs creating headaches, and they don’t want to get paged and work nights because problems have been discovered and exploited. You can encourage ownership by asking your dev team to review the security team handling analyses. Ultimately, this can go a long way towards establishing security-dev collaboration, leading to apps that get to market more securely as well quickly.</li><li><strong>Create a golden image.</strong> A <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-hardened-images/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">golden Image</a>is a single machine image that has been tested and hardened. When there is an operating system or library update, the AMI gets updated and tested. This allows you to see how your customers might be impacted before you push that patch update out to thousands of users. It also provides an approved starting point for new business units or apps. The time it takes to create and maintain this image pays off in protected services and reduced downtimes. Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_(computing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardened</a>) images also increases reliability and consistency.</li></ul><h2 id="Hiring-Security-Talent">Hiring Security Talent</h2><p>Security can seem like an area that is purely technical — and your team does need to have a deep understanding of your product and how it works, but sooner or later, a human is going to touch or use your product. Strong security talent needs to understand human behavior from bad actors to customers. Your chief information security officer (CISO) also needs to be able to explain technical risks and benefits to non-technical executive teams.</p><p>There’s a cybersecurity talent shortage globally. According to an International Information System Security Certification Consortium (ISC)² <a href="https://www.isc2.org/Research/Workforce-Study#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a>, that shortage shrank slightly during the pandemic, from 4 million open jobs in 2019 to 3.1 million. You’re going to need to compete for talent.</p><p>Your new CISO also needs to understand your industry because threats are often industry-specific. Here are some questions to ask your hiring team when considering a potential candidate:</p><ul><li>Are they passionate about not only security but also your company?</li><li>Do they have experience in your industry? If not, how adept are they at cross-applying knowledge?</li><li>Areas of expertise? If you need them to be a generalist, do they understand how to source third-party support (and are you willing to fund that support)?</li><li>Do they welcome diversity?</li><li>Do they contribute to open source security?</li><li>Do they regularly attend and speak at conferences?</li><li>Can they explain the business case for your product?</li></ul><h2 id="Privacy--Longer-Term-Planning">Privacy: Longer-Term Planning</h2><p>Consumers are demanding a secure and contextual private experience — and we’re seeing regulators back them up with a variety of data privacy regulations.</p><p>&#34;<em>By industry, consumers are most comfortable sharing data with providers in healthcare and financial services, though no industry reached a trust rating of 50 percent for data protection,</em>” notes <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/risk/our-insights/the-consumer-data-opportunity-and-the-privacy-imperative" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">McKinsey</a>.</p><p>This isn’t one of those things that is going away, says Auth0’s Vice President of Privacy Lucy McGrath. Globally, we’re seeing consumer groups becoming more vocal about data privacy concerns and violations with filings against companies like <a href="https://www.beuc.eu/publications/consumer-groups-file-complaint-against-whatsapp-unfairly-pressuring-users-accept-its/html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">What’sApp</a>. </p><p>“<em>Data privacy is going to continue to evolve with consumers’ awareness and expectations,</em>” says Lucy. “<em>To adapt, companies are going to have to think beyond just meeting the bare minimum of legal requirements. They need to ask themselves hard questions about what protections are appropriate given the context and the humans you’re interacting with and work through the answers. We need to be building proactive privacy programs that reflect these data privacy conversations. Creating consumer trust requires listening and deliberate action.</em>”</p><p>Start with these questions:</p><ul><li>Have I taken the time to understand the relationship my digital properties (app, site) create with my customers? How do I want them to feel at login? What about as they continue through my app or site?</li><li>Am I encouraging or discouraging trust by how I gather consent and data?</li><li>Have I created a transparent customer experience (CX) with clear consent and options?</li><li>If I am really honest with myself, do I need to change something? Do I really need this data?</li><li>Who are my customers? What does privacy mean to them in the context of my services?</li><li>Do I have appropriate basic security and data governance processes in place?</li><li>Have I invested extra resources and time to protect the most sensitive/high-risk data such as health, financial, religious, or sexual orientation information?</li><li>Do I have any customers in regulated jurisdictions such as the European Union (EU) or California? If so, when was the last time I checked in with my legal counsel to make sure I’m in line with current requirements?</li></ul><h2 id="Provide-Cues-for-Safety-and-Trust">Provide Cues for Safety and Trust</h2><p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/apple-app-privacy-labels/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple’s nutrition labels for data privacy</a> make good on efforts that have been around since the 2010s. If your new app is going to be in the App Store, Apple requires that you report publicly on data you’re using to track your customers, data linked to them, and data gathered but not linked to them. Even though Apple is relying on app developers to self-report, the labels increase consumer awareness and expectation, says Lucy. Given Apple’s size ($274.5 billion reported revenue in 2020 makes it the world’s largest company), these nutrition labels signal that data privacy is now an everyday consumer concern.</p><p>“<em>Businesses who don’t respond could miss out</em>”, says Lucy. “<em>The threats of data privacy fines and unhappy customers are real, but so is the opportunity to create customer experiences (CX) that drive brand loyalty. The entire tech industry is coming together to work on these data privacy challenges. Companies that act on the side of the consumer stand out.</em>”</p><h2 id="Hiring-Data-Privacy-Talent">Hiring Data Privacy Talent</h2><p>Like security, data privacy professionals need to understand and express the intersection of humans and technology. They need to be able to communicate risks and benefits across an entire organization, with an emphasis on engineering, marketing, and senior leadership. Critical and analytical thinking, empathy, and consideration of different motivations and perspectives are key. Technical knowledge around privacy laws can be taught, but an ability to engage, listen and understand the context of the business and their customers is essential. Privacy isn’t “done” by privacy professionals - they support all parts of the business to build privacy protections into their individual business processes.</p><p>Lucy recommends that you ask candidates questions to show how they think about privacy issues in the context of the businesses in which they work. Examples of such questions include: </p><ul><li>How would you demonstrate the value of good privacy practices to the chief financial officer (CFO)?</li><li>How do you respond to the statement: privacy slows the business down?</li><li>What can you do to support developers to integrate privacy controls into their development lifecycle?</li><li>Provide examples of when you have translated legal obligations into plain English requirements that the business can implement?</li><li>Which company does privacy well? Why? How would you implement similar standards here?</li><li>What are the key privacy risks that need to be prioritized? What actions are required to mitigate these risks?</li></ul><h2 id="You-re-Helping-Make-the-Internet-Safer">You’re Helping Make the Internet Safer</h2><p>Thank you for checking out this series.

You can check out our earlier posts in this series for details, but here, we wanted to look more closely at how we were able to help two companies within the region.</p><h2 id="Naranja---From-Leading-Credit-Card-Issuer-in-Argentina--To-Complete-Consumer-Ecosystem">Naranja — From Leading Credit Card Issuer in Argentina, To Complete Consumer Ecosystem</h2><p><a href="https://auth0.com/case-studies/naranja/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fintech leader Naranja</a> has been providing credit cards to the Argentinian market for over 30 years. In that time, they’ve grown to cover over 5 million customers by keeping those customers’ needs their top priority. As they grew, Naranja also began to integrate additional verticals into their business model. Pretty soon, they were offering payment services, financing, travel, media, and other services beyond their credit card programs.</p><p>As they added these verticals, Naranja’s head of engineering Javier Voos soon realized they would need to consolidate their identity solution to cover all aspects of their growing ecosystem. He knew that in order to continue putting the customer experience first, they would need to find the right IDaaS provider that would be able to scale along with their planned expansion.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqouiuVk07Q&amp;feature=emb_imp_woyt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">link to video</a></p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kqouiuVk07Q" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" itemprop="author"><p>“The main idea behind the Naranja ecosystem is to provide the best experience to our customers, making sure that our digital platform provides all the resources that an online business needs for success, and hence support the ecosystem evolution.”</p><p>Javier Voos</p><p>Head of Engineerin</p><p>Naranja</p></div><p>Voos’ priority was to find a platform that provided secure APIs for identity so they could focus their expansion efforts on B2B services alongside their expanded consumer offerings.

They’ll be able to shop, pay, and track delivery all in one place.</p><p>Juan Manuel Mingo, former WABI Business Manager, sums up the hurdle they faced when it came to identity and customer authentication, “We had different platforms with different user registration processes,” he says. “Our aim was to unify all the user registration of the different platforms in order to get a better user experience and to have a more organized user database.” The disjointed customer experience was the first thing WABI knew they would have to solve before they could continue growing and expanding their e-commerce ecosystem. </p><div itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Person" itemprop="author"><p>“Our endgame is that you enter the ecosystem through Wabi.

      <title>A Complete Guide to Lombok</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/a-complete-guide-to-lombok/</link>
      <description>Let’s see everything you should know to start using Project Lombok. We will have a look at how to integrate it into your IDE and use it to avoid boilerplate code.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Java is a great but verbose language. You may be ending up writing many lines of code even to achieve the most common goals. Plus, it definitely involves repetitive code, like getters and setters. This leads to a huge amount of boilerplate and avoidable code. Not only does this add nothing to the business logic of your application, but writing it is an unnecessarily boring and time-consuming process. This is why you should start employing tools and libraries to make you more productive by avoiding this. That’s where Lombok comes into play!</p><p>This Java library provides you with several annotations aimed at avoiding writing Java code known to be repetitive and/or boilerplate. Project Lombok works by plugging into your build process. Then, it will auto-generate the Java bytecode into your <em>.class</em> files required to implement the desired behavior, based on the annotations you used. Thus, each annotation offered by Project Lombok allows you to skip writing methods and logic you would like to avoid, like constructors, equals, and hash code functions. This will save you a lot of time and let you focus on the business logic of your project. Plus, you will be able to keep your codebase smaller, cleaner, and easier to be read and maintained.</p><p>First, we will see what Project Lombok is and how it works. Then, we will study the most common and relevant Lombok’s annotations, understanding what the most important ones are, where, and how to use them. Next, it will be time to see how to integrate it in your IDE (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Integrated Development Environment</a>) and why you should not be afraid of using it.</p><h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2><p>This is the list of all the prerequisites to replicate the examples that will be shown next:</p><ul><li>Java &gt;= 1.8</li><li>Gradle &gt;= 4.x or Maven 3.6.x</li><li>Project Lombok &gt;= 1.18.20</li></ul><h2 id="What-is-Lombok">What is Lombok</h2><p><a href="https://projectlombok.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Lombok</a> (from now on, <em>Lombok</em>) is an annotation-based Java library that allows you to reduce boilerplate code. Lombok offers various annotations aimed at replacing Java code that is well known for being boilerplate, repetitive, or tedious to write. For example, by using Lombok, you can avoid writing constructors with no arguments, <code><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code>, <code><span>equals</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code>, and <code><span>hashCode</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> methods by simply adding a few annotations. The magic happens during the compile-time when the library injects the bytecode representing the desired and boilerplate code into your <em>.class</em> files. Plus, as we will see, the library can be plugged into your IDE, letting you have the same experience as if you had written all the boilerplate code yourself.</p><p>You can easily install Lombok by adding <a href="https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.projectlombok/lombok/1.18.20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>lombok</code></a> to your dependencies.
If you are a <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/gradle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gradle user</a>, add these two lines to the dependencies section of your <code>build<span>.</span>gradle</code> file:</p><pre><code>compileOnly <span>&#39;org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.20&#39;</span>
annotationProcessor <span>&#39;org.projectlombok:lombok:1.18.20&#39;</span></code></pre><p>While if you are a <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/maven" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maven user</a>, add the following dependency to your <code>pom<span>.</span>xml</code> file:</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>dependency</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
      <span><span><span>&lt;</span>groupId</span><span>&gt;</span></span>org.projectlombok<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>groupId</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

To see examples and get more support, click on each annotation and visit its page on the <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lombok official documentation</a>.</p><h3 id="---Getter---https---projectlombok-org-features-GetterSetter------Setter---https---projectlombok-org-features-GetterSetter-"><a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>@Getter</code></a>, <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/GetterSetter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>@Setter</code></a></h3><p>When a field is annotated with <code>@Getter</code> and/or <code>@Setter</code>, Lombok will automatically generate the default getter and/or setter, respectively. The default implementation for getters simply takes care of returning the annotated field. Similarly, the default implementation for setters takes one parameter of the same type as the annotated field and simply sets it with the received value. When a field called <code>value</code> is annotated with both <code>@Getter</code> and <code>@Setter</code>, Lombok will define a <code><span>getValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> (or <code><span>isValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> if the field is <code>boolean</code>), and a <code><span>setValue</span><span>(</span><span>)</span></code> method. The generated getter/setter method will be <code><span>public</span></code>, unless a particular <code>AccessLevel</code> is specified. The allowed <code>AccessLevel</code> values are <code><span>PUBLIC</span></code>, <code><span>PROTECTED</span></code>, <code><span>PACKAGE</span></code>, and <code><span>PRIVATE</span></code>. Please, note that you can also annotate the entire class. In this case, this logic will be applied to each field.</p><h4 id="With-Lombok">With Lombok</h4><pre><code><span>@Getter</span>

So, this annotation allows you to avoid the required <code><span>try</span><span>-</span>catch</code> blocks completely by handling all the checked exceptions quietly. Lombok will not ignore, wrap, replace, or modify the thrown checked exception. On the contrary, it will mislead the compiler. In fact, at the JVM (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Java Virtual Machine</a>) class file level, all exceptions can be thrown regardless of the <code>throws</code> clause of your methods, which is why this works. This annotation can be dangerous and should be used carefully. This is why you should read <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/SneakyThrows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this</a> page from the Lombok official documentation to learn more about when and how to use it.</p><h3 id="---Builder---https---projectlombok-org-features-Builder-"><a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/Builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>@Builder</code></a></h3><p>You may need to develop a builder object allowing you to create objects by following a step-by-step construction pattern, such as <code>Author<span>.</span><span>builder</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>id</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;1&#34;</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;Maria&#34;</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>surname</span><span>(</span><span>&#34;Williams&#34;</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code>. This is particularly useful when dealing with large classes with several fields. Instead of using a constructor with many parameters, you can use this more readable approach.
By using the <code>@Builder</code> annotation, you let Lombok generate the builders for you. By annotating a class with <code>@Builder</code>, Lombok will produce a class implementing the aforementioned builder pattern. For example, by annotating the <code>Author</code> class, an <code>AuthorBuilder</code> class will be automatically generated. Since the behavior of your builder may be complex or highly-tailored, Lombok offers many parameters to achieve the desired result. You can find out them all <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/Builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><h3 id="---Log---https---projectlombok-org-features-log-"><a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/log" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><code>@Log</code></a></h3><p>The majority of loggers require you to set up a logger instance in every class where you want to log. This definitely involves boilerplate code. By annotating a class with <code>@Log</code>, Lombok will automatically add a static final <code>log</code> field, initialized as required by your logging library. This is why Lombok provides developers with an annotation per each of the most popular logging frameworks. You can find the entire list <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/log" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><h2 id="The-Lombok-Plugin">The Lombok Plugin</h2><p>The most popular and widely used IDEs come with an official Lombok plugin designed to help developers use Lombok. In particular, it supports you by offering shortcuts to the most common Lombok annotation. Plus, it suggests to you the annotations you may require or be looking for based on where you clicked. At the time of writing <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/intellij" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IntelliJ IDEA</a>, <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/eclipse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eclipse, Spring Tool Suite, (Red Hat) JBoss Developer Studio, MyEclipse</a>, <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/vscode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft Visual Studio Code</a>, and <a href="https://projectlombok.org/setup/netbeans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netbeans</a> are officially supported. Follow the link related to your IDE to get support on how to install it.
Visit the <a href="https://projectlombok.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lombok</a> website for the complete list of all supported IDEs.</p><h2 id="Is-Using-Lombok-A-Risk-">Is Using Lombok A Risk?</h2><p>You may be concerned about spreading Lombok annotations throughout your codebase. In fact, what would happen if you decided to avoid using it? You might be finding yourself stuck. Well, this is not a real problem because Lombok comes with a <em>delombok</em> tool. 
As stated <a href="https://projectlombok.org/features/delombok" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in the official documentation</a>, although not covering all possible IDEs and cases, it makes the process of freeing your code from Lombok easier. What this tool does is auto-generate Java source code containing the same features contained in the bytecode Lombok would have injected. This way, your Lombok annotated codebase will be simply replaced with a standard, non-Lombok Java one. 
As a result, your entire project will no longer depend on Lombok. So, to answer the original question, no, not at all. Using Lombok does not represent a risk for the future or your project.</p><h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we looked at how to use Project Lombok, a Java library that automatically plugs into your editor and builds tools, to avoid writing boilerplate, boring, and repetitive code Java is well known for. As shown, this is an easy way to make you a more productive developer and do not waste your time on cumbersome activities. By starting to take advantage of its most relevant annotations, you can avoid writing thousand of lines of code with no real value from the business logic point of view of your project. Plus, there is always the possibility to make your project no longer depend on Project Lombok easily. So, it using it does not represent a risk of finding yourself locked in. In conclusion, every Java developer should use Project Lombok, and explaining everything you need to start using it is what this article was aimed at.</p><p>Thanks for reading!

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Accelerating digital road maps by seven to 10 years likely left you with some things to review from a security perspective. Please check out the <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/accelerated-your-road-map-go-fix-workforce-and-app-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first post in this series</a> for what you might need to review to securely support your remote or hybrid workforce, as well as a checklist for consumer-facing apps.</p><p>Security isn’t the only thing that can get overlooked when we go fast.  As well as implementing technical protections — we also need to understand what and how the data and how impacts the humans that use technology. This is where privacy comes in. Privacy is having a critical global impact on software development because consumers, businesses, and governments are demanding that technology operates in a way that complies with legislation like GDPR (General Data Privacy Regulation), CPRA (California Public Records Act), APPI (Act on the Protection of Personal Information), and LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais). This is an opportunity to rethink exactly what and how much data is collected, how it’s used, and who gets to see it. It’s a turning point where individuals are no longer blithely accepting that massive amounts of data about them are being created, shared, and used.</p><p>At Auth0, I regularly collaborate with our vice president of privacy, Lucy McGrath, and she is a part of my organization. For this series, I asked Lucy for her perspective on data privacy mistakes companies can make when they move fast.</p><p>An integrated approach is essential for security and privacy. There’s a saying if you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together. This is changing — you can’t protect privacy alone. If you go alone, you won’t go anywhere. “Ultimately, data privacy is about trust,” says Lucy. “And it’s a collaborative effort. You can’t think about security or data governance, or privacy in isolation. You need to work across departments within your organization and also listen to your staff and your consumers/users. From a practical standpoint, you need to work with others even beyond your immediate business — data privacy regulations are changing rapidly —technical solutions are essential in order to scale privacy compliant technology. If you don’t collaborate, you’ll be left behind.”</p><p>Lucy’s insights on remote/hybrid workforces and consumer-facing apps can improve your workplace culture and improve your relationships with your customers — and keep you focused on your business rather than dealing with regulators and potentially incurring large fines.</p><h2 id="Put-Your-Focus-on-the-Human">Put Your Focus on the Human</h2><p>“Probably the most important thing to remember when thinking through data privacy is that you’re delivering a service that impacts humans,” says Lucy. “We can get dazzled by what technology can do, but the technology is really there to help the humans accomplish something. Centering on the human who needs to use or benefit from the technology helps you to focus.  — and align with existing and emerging data privacy regulations.”</p><p>As always, this information is shared from the perspective of business impact and planning. For how data privacy regulations apply to your specific business situation, please reach out to your legal counsel.</p><blockquote><p>Auth0 recommends you always consult legal counsel for specific advice about compliance with legal requirements.</p></blockquote><p><strong>The workforce mix: remote, hybrid, in office</strong></p><p>If your company relies on a globally dispersed workforce (or acquired one during the pandemic), you’re likely dealing with a mix of employees who welcome some office quietly, some still struggling with lockdown requirements, and others who may not expect to see vaccines become available until fall. “As you look at creating or reviewing policies, it’s especially important to remember that there’s a human on the other side of the Zoom screen”, says Lucy. “This is a good time for your HR team to check back in with staff. Circumstances and perspectives have changed for many people as a result of the pandemic. One size definitely will not fit all.”</p><p>Understanding that worker privacy rights vary globally, here are some areas to review:</p><h3 id="1--How-you-measure-productivity">1. How you measure productivity</h3><p>For organizations used to seeing people in chairs, the shift to Zoom screens caused some anxiety. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/valuable-productivity-gains-covid-19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% of 12,000 workers surveyed by BCG</a> in the United States, Germany, and India felt they were able to maintain or increase productivity on individual tasks during the pandemic. </p><p>Some of that may have been accomplished by blurring the lines between home and work, says Lucy. </p><p>Surveillance technologies like keyloggers, video monitoring, and attention tracking via biometrics have been rising in adoption even before the pandemic. We’re hearing this often says, Lucy: “I like my boss — a lot —  but I would find it a bit creepy if she was tracking every word I write, tracking when I popped off to the loo and listening to my family conversations. And it would make it harder to do my job because I would feel unnecessarily surveilled. It’s really important to assess the correct way to protect data and maintain trust with your employees as humans. Especially with workers working from home in potentially cramped situations, you could be gathering data you don’t need and shouldn’t have.</p><p>“Workers generally know that emails are subject to company oversight nearly everywhere, but it’s essential to be transparent about monitoring activities across all applications and devices. Transparency also encourages trust and increases the likelihood that individuals will report issues/mistakes they encounter. Tell them about how long you retain the data, and why and be sure to check local rules about internal and external data sharing — they can vary by region and even by state in the United States. It’s important to only keep what you really need to perform a task,” says Lucy.</p><h3 id="2--How-do-you-encourage-collaboration-">2. How do you encourage collaboration?</h3><p>Nearly everyone became Zoom-literate in 2020. Many people were introduced to Slack or other collaboration tools, and some folks also mixed in personal texts. “As great as these technologies are — and I am speaking as someone who enjoys working with a globally distributed workforce — they’re not going to replicate the physical space. From a privacy perspective, some small changes can mean a lot to employees,” says Lucy.</p><p>“Some people enjoy having dogs and kids flow in and out of their workplace. Others prefer to keep things separated. Over the last several months, I’ve noticed some colleagues making different choices.”</p><p>Things like Zoom backgrounds can protect employee privacy, but only if they know how to use the tools. If you’re using a collaboration tool like Zoom or Slack, document expected uses, alternatives on offer (as applicable) and make sure employees know how to use tools like Zoom backgrounds. </p><h3 id="3--Onboarding-can-protect-against-data-breaches">3. Onboarding can protect against data breaches</h3><p>Normally, we bring our new employees to our Bellevue, Wash. offices for onboarding. This in-person connection brings all kinds of benefits, including protecting data. “Onboarding may seem like an odd place to bring up data privacy, but people are more likely to feel comfortable reporting potential problems or even breaches when they have formed a connection to their colleagues,” says Lucy.</p><p>Establishing connections may mean creating social events (likely on Zoom) or connecting employees for non-work meetings. We have an app that randomly pairs employees for casual chat sessions we call “donuts.” It’s a surprisingly effective way to establish connection and get to know about the day-to-day work life of far-flung colleagues.</p><h3 id="4--Security-and-Privacy-of-Customers-is-Key">4. Security and Privacy of Customers is Key</h3><p>“We’ve had workers who used to be home by themselves all day, suddenly have teenaged children pass through meetings on the way to the fridge,” says Lucy. “It’s charming, but it also means that family members might see things they’re not meant to see. You need to recognize that not everyone has the luxury of a room with a door and a lock. Protecting customer security and privacy is key.”</p><p>To your security protocols, Lucy would also suggest adding:</p><ul><li>Headphones so you can control what can be overheard (and coaching that awareness with your teams)</li><li>Privacy screens for monitors</li><li>Printed material (and the printer) needs to be kept in a space that remains locked when not in use</li></ul><h2 id="Data-Privacy-Checklist-for-Consumer-Facing-Apps">Data Privacy Checklist for Consumer-Facing Apps</h2><p>COVID has brought populations that are used to trust in physical environments online, says Lucy. This is part of why in the UK we’re seeing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/may/18/delivery-text-scams-the-nasty-new-wave-sweeping-the-uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase in delivery text phishing scams</a> where additional funds are requested for delivery. Many of these ploys play on user trust and the expectation that information is being shared securely. We’ll get deeper into how consumers are demanding a secure and contextual private experience in the final post. As preparation, here is a data privacy checklist. Please follow up with your legal counsel on your specifics.</p><ol start="1"><li><strong>Review what you’ve got and why you’ve got it and how you’re getting it.</strong> It’s not uncommon for apps to gather more information than is necessary to do the job. You need to know what data you have and why you’re collecting it as well how it’s stored to comply with regulations — and to know how to safeguard your customers’ data. <strong>This includes third-party vendors and your marketing teams.</strong></li><li><strong>Make sure your code only collects data you really need</strong>. The days of data gluttony are coming to an end. Individuals are rightly fed up with the attitude of “just because you can collect as much data as possible, you do. Ask yourself: do you use all the data you collect? Don’t be afraid to reduce the amount of data you collect when you update your app or add new products. Look for opportunities to innovate by using privacy-enhancing technologies to mask or anonymize, or de-identify data. And safely delete the information you don’t use.</li><li><strong>Know where your customers are and check out the regulations.</strong> While the EU’s General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR) has become the benchmark for data privacy, not every regulation is GDPR. There are differences. Children also often have extra protections. Once you’ve identified where and who your customers are, work closely with your legal counsel to design the right approach.</li><li><strong>Securely delete info and keep a record.</strong> Maybe you’re deleting information due to a verified request or because you have data you actually don’t need; either way, you need to keep a record.</li><li><strong>Make sure you have someone responsible for privacy who respects the humans interacting with your app.</strong> This stuff is not simple. You need someone who looks after it.</li><li><strong>Look out for service departments or social media complaints.</strong> Complaints can show you how the public perceives their data is being used — and identify areas that need your attention.</li><li><strong>Communicate clearly with your users.</strong> Users often need to know how to unsubscribe and other rights as part of data privacy regulations.</li><li><strong>Do as you would be done by.</strong> Think through how you’d like your data to be treated. That’s a good guideline. But also think about the specific customer base - what’s their perspective and might they require additional protections (e.g., if they are a vulnerable group).</li><li><strong>Consult your legal counsel.</strong> Data privacy is a rapidly evolving field. Lawyers really are your friends! Please check in with your legal counsel regularly, and especially if you’re thinking of expanding into a new region.</li></ol><h2 id="Learn-More-about-Identity-s-Role-in-Your-Data-Privacy-Strategy">Learn More about Identity’s Role in Your Data Privacy Strategy</h2><p>As Lucy says, you can have security without privacy, but you can’t have privacy without security if you’d like to learn more about how a robust identity solution can support your data privacy and security strategies, <a href="https://auth0.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">please reach out to the team at Auth0</a>.</p><p>In the final post in the Acceleration Response Series, we’ll look at how creating a long-term plan for security and privacy can help you meet consumers’ demands.</p><div><h2 id="About-Auth0">About Auth0 </h2><p>Auth0’s modern approach to identity enables organizations to provide secure access to any application, for any user.

      <title>Can Your Identity Solution Grow With Your Company?</title>
      <link>https://auth0.com/blog/can-your-identity-solution-grow-with-your-company/</link>
      <description>The tech market in Latin America is growing; Auth0 can help you keep up with a scalable identity solution.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The number of Venture Capital deals signed in Latin America hit a record high of 488 in 2020. That’s nearly double the 2017 number according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/latin-american-startups-had-record-venture-capital-deals-in-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg</a>. The growth in the tech market in LatAm isn’t only apparent in new startup deals; companies who already have a presence in the region are expanding both through mergers and acquisitions and by looking into new countries to grow their footprint in the region. </p><p>Each scenario brings its own challenges for your IT infrastructure, particularly your<a href="https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-scale-quickly-with-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> identity solution</a>. If you’re expanding into a new country, there’s likely to be a different data privacy regulation you’ll have to comply with. And that startup you’re eyeing probably has a vastly different infrastructure than yours, whether private or public cloud or even legacy on-prem. An Identity management solution has to be able to expand and flex in order to grow with your company, regardless of the specific scenario.</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/1HnNeEEQ4hCBb2M4y2ZerT/5b5a1de004ea8021fdc38d042a85a672/Latam05.jpg" alt="Business Expansion"/></p><h2 id="With-Business-Expansion-Come-Business-Questions">With Business Expansion Come Business Questions</h2><p>Let’s take a look at those two potential growth scenarios and what they mean for your business’s identity solution. First up is the acquisition of a competitor or related smaller entity. <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/why-your-ma-strategy-has-to-include-an-iam-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mergers and acquisitions</a> (M&amp;A) always bring an array of unique challenges, but for this article, we’re going to focus on the identity challenges associated with the merging of IT infrastructure.</p><p>Your web app may be hosted on a public cloud, but the company you just bought has been in business for a while and is still using on-prem hosting for theirs. In order for you to bring both properties together under one identity solution, you need one that can bridge the gap between the two, allowing your new audience access to both apps without managing multiple sets of credentials.</p><p>In our second scenario, your organization is considering an expansion into a neighboring country to take advantage of the easing of business restrictions and the growing market for your product that your marketing team has identified. You already comply with the privacy regulations in your country, but are you ready to comply with those abroad? </p><p>Is your organization ready to answer questions like these:</p><ul><li>Can our existing in-house identity platform scale to include our hybrid-cloud infrastructure and the legacy system our latest acquisition uses?</li><li>Is our identity solution ready to handle the influx of new user accounts and login requests when we roll out to our new market?</li><li>Is our consent gathering process in compliance with the regulations in the country we’re expanding into?</li></ul><p>If not, or if the answer to any of these questions is “no,” it may be time to consult with an identity specialist. </p><blockquote><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=&#34;Auth0%20recommends%20you%20always%20consult%20legal%20counsel%20when%20it%20comes%20to%20complying%20with%20data%20privacy%20regulations.&#34; via @auth0 https://auth0.com/blog/can-your-identity-solution-grow-with-your-company" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><p>&#34;Auth0 recommends you always consult legal counsel when it comes to complying with data privacy regulations.&#34;</p><div><p><img alt="Tweet" src="https://cdn.auth0.com/blog/resources/twitter.svg"/></p><h4>Tweet This</h4></div></a></blockquote><h2 id="Auth0-Is-the-Identity-Solution-That-Scales-With-You">Auth0 Is the Identity Solution That Scales With You</h2><p>Both of these scenarios mean you’re going to be scaling your infrastructure, adding users to existing web apps, and even adding new web apps. Having an identity solution in place that can easily expand to include controlling access to these new properties can help reign in costs and speed your time to market post-expansion. Our customers tell us that by using Auth0 for their authentication and identity needs, they took their time-to-value from months or years down to weeks or even days.</p><p>Credit card company <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/visa-sees-massive-digital-acceleration-with-millions-trying-e-commerce-for-the-first-time-2020-05-13" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visa reported</a> that during just the first month of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than 13 million cardholders in Latin America made their very first e-commerce transaction. That’s 13 million new accounts being created, 13 million new logins, and 13 million opportunities for identity to go wrong if your solution isn’t scalable. There are many aspects to what makes something scalable. When it comes to identity, we see five as being the most important.</p><ol start="1"><li><strong>Bridging legacy and cloud systems</strong></li></ol><p>One of the downsides to M&amp;A is that your IT department inherits the backend infrastructure of the other company, for better or worse. Auth0’s extensive SDK libraries and robust APIs mean it’s a simple matter to bridge the gap between legacy systems and modern cloud-first ones. One login box can take your current and new customers to both web apps, no matter where they’re hosted. This ability also speeds your time to value because your developers can maintain focus on their core product delivery rather than piecing together connectivity solutions that may only work for a short time.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Single source of truth for customer data</strong></li></ol><p>Bringing all of your customer data together into one single source of truth (SSoT) makes it that much easier to protect. It also speeds access when a user logs in, as no matter which property they’re using, it has only one place to look to find their credentials, rather than scouring multiple data silos.</p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Single sign-on</strong></li></ol><p>Customers want low-friction experiences online, and being able to create an account using credentials they already have is a great way to win them over. Single sign-on (using account information from a provider like Apple, Facebook, or Twitter) allows a customer to create an account on your site quickly and easily, and without the need to create and remember a new password.</p><ol start="4"><li><strong>Breach protection</strong></li></ol><p>The issue of passwords brings us to a major sticking point for many identity solutions, protecting user information from data breaches. According to the most recent <a href="https://www.ibm.com/security/data-breach" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBM/Ponemon Cost of a Data Breach Study</a>, the global average cost of a breach is now $3.86 million (USD). And Verizon reports in their <a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2021 Data Breach Investigations Report</a> that 61% of breaches involve misuse of credentials. Put those together, and you see why protecting your customers’ information is such a major piece of scaling your online business presence and why a robust identity solution needs to take this aspect into account.</p><ol start="5"><li><strong>Protection from staffing fluctuations</strong></li></ol><p>An often overlooked aspect of identity projects is the simple fact that people change jobs. If you have an identity tool that was developed in-house two years ago, there’s a good chance you won’t have anyone on staff who can expand it to cover your new properties. That will delay roll-out and extend your time-to-market. </p><p><a href="https://auth0.com/case-studies/wabipay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Auth0 customer WABI</a> is modernizing e-commerce in Latin America. They’re currently active in 11 countries and have expansion plans to add four more in 2021. And they’re trusting Auth0 to scale their identity solution to match these ambitious plans. “WABI is scalable, and we need a partner that is, too. We believe Auth0 will support us in getting there.” Says WABI Business Manager Juan Manuel Mingo. With their planned expansion opening their market to millions of potential new customers, WABI knows they need a robust identity platform that’s ready to handle the influx of new users.</p><h2 id="Auth0-Brings-Global-Experience-to-Your-Latin-America-Growth-Plans">Auth0 Brings Global Experience to Your Latin America Growth Plans</h2><p>Our founders are from Argentina, the company was started in the United States, and we currently have people in 30+ countries with more being added every day.

Our extensive marketplace of integrations means you can connect with your existing business software solutions as well.</p><p>Our breach protection includes features such as <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/attack-protection/bot-detection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bot detection</a>, <a href="https://auth0.com/multifactor-authentication" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adaptive MFA</a>, <a href="https://auth0.com/single-sign-on" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single sign-on</a>, and <a href="https://auth0.com/passwordless" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passwordless</a> flows.

Orgs went remote overnight; businesses launched consumer-facing apps, and <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/how-brick-and-mortar-approaches-improve-digital-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumers shifted buying patterns online</a>.</p><p>Going fast gets products to market, it gives consumers choices, and it helps companies scale. But when you jump ahead seven to 10 years in your digital road map, you risk leaving a few security and data privacy concerns behind. I reached out to key members of my security team, as well as our data privacy team, to put together this three-part series based on our industry experience and observations.</p><p>Each post will focus on protecting and securing two critical areas: your workforce and your consumer-facing apps. The first post will focus on security details to check and mitigate now. The second will focus on immediate data privacy concerns with the help of Auth0 Vice President, Privacy Lucy McGrath. And the third post will help you put together a plan for the future that will make it easier the next time you want to turn on the speed — and to remain current in an ever-changing security landscape.</p><p>The thing is that security is a global team sport.  As more of us shift to working and living online, everything is more connected — and that can be a good thing. Securing your personal identity, your business identity, and helping increase security at your business can actually make an impact. Here’s what you can do to help make the internet safer for everyone.</p><h2 id="Why-Remote-Work-Forced-a-Change-in-Security-Thinking">Why Remote Work Forced a Change in Security Thinking</h2><p>Before the world started working remotely, a lot of companies used a castle-and-moat approach to security. They relied on a combination of physical security and internal networks to ensure that employees and outsiders only accessed necessary information. They might even have relied on SaaS companies to provide some of their protections, but the thinking was still pretty much “protect the castle.”</p><p>Suddenly workers were working anywhere in the world, maybe on their own devices. Without remote experience, your security team might not have had time to think through all of the security issues inherent with having remote endpoints. For example, to ensure that they properly protect these assets against current threats like ransomware and malware, it would be appropriate to install leading next-gen antivirus on these machines.</p><p>Role-based privileges and policies also abruptly needed to follow the user. I know I work for an identity company, but it was identity and policy <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/why-identity-federation-matters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federation</a> that anticipated this need and allowed for a rapid response.</p><p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-asking-employees-to-work-from-home-due-to-coronavirus-2020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Now some companies are making work from home a permanent</a> part of their employee offering. Since Auth0 was built as a remote-friendly, globally dispersed company, we’ve had some time to think through the security concerns. Here’s what you need to consider to protect your customers, your business, and your employees:</p><ol start="1"><li><strong>Secure the endpoints.</strong> Services like CarbonBlack or CrowdStrike can help prevent malware or breaches occurring from endpoints.</li><li><strong>Update bring your own device policies.</strong> Rethink how and where employees are accessing business and customer data. Do you need to restrict access in public spaces? Adjust policies?</li><li><strong>Update action policies</strong>. What do your employees do if a work computer is stolen? What steps do they need to take if the information is exposed at home? A <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/51--of-wfh-parents-say-children-have-accessed-work-accounts/d/d-id/1339754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1Password survey</a> found that 51% of work from home (WFH) parents surveyed said their children had accessed their work accounts, sometimes accidentally deleting necessary files.  How can you support your employees??</li><li><strong>Human risk is increased.</strong> Have a look at the next section.</li></ol><h2 id="The-Human-Element">The Human Element</h2><p>This is the critical part of this series — <strong>the human element is the most important aspect of security and data privacy.</strong></p><blockquote><p>Security awareness training needs to happen at every single level of your organization.</p></blockquote><p>A malicious actor is going to use everything you need to do business — email address patterns, information on your website, social media posts, and items gleaned from news articles all to try to gain entry to your system. While the attacks will vary, they usually follow this pattern: <strong>human factor</strong> + inject something into the code + lack of input validation + insufficient logging and monitoring.</p><p>If something looks like it’s coming from your CEO or payroll, an employee might fall for it and supply a way into your system. And once a bad actor is in, there’s lots they can do.</p><p>But if you train your entire team to watch out for phishing attacks, you can stop them at the first step. <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/protecting-against-phishing-attacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This post is a good place to start.</a></p><p>Attacks evolve, so even though security awareness is something you should pause and do now, it’s something you’re going to need to do regularly. Developing a security culture throughout your org provides great protection. To do business with some industries like finance or healthcare, the training will be required to cover specific areas and will need to be documented. The training you provide can also help protect your employees in their personal lives.</p><h2 id="Top-7-Things-to-Do-Now-to-Check-Your-App-s-Security">Top 7 Things to Do Now to Check Your App’s Security</h2><p>This can seem like a lot if you don’t have an in-house security team (and maybe if you do). One principle of security is encouraging diversity of thought not only because it’s the right thing to do but because studies show it makes teams more productive. In security, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/innovation-in-a-crisis-why-it-is-more-critical-than-ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diversity of thought</a> makes it easier to spot potential threats. This is part of why even large teams rely on external testing vendors and may even need to provide proof of outside testing for certifications like <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/the-csa-star-program-a-business-guide-to-certification/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CSA Star</a> and <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/what-is-pci-a-business-guide-to-compliance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PCI</a>.</p><ol start="1"><li><strong>Get an external third-party pen test — and implement the recommendations</strong>. A penetration test is where you hire a verified third party to attempt to find your app’s vulnerabilities. They will sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and provide a detailed report outlining their findings and usually with recommended fixes cataloged by severity. Discovering vulnerabilities can be scary, and there is the temptation to use fear to drive organizational change, but we’ve found that partnering and collaborating with other teams and leadership can often get changes implemented faster.</li><li><strong>Review best practices for your cloud-based services.</strong> When people go really fast, they may not take the time to fully understand the technology and security controls. This is a great time to go back and pay really close attention to the docs provided by your third-party vendors.</li></ol><blockquote><p>“Many common AWS security issues, for example, happen as a result of not following AWS security best practice guidelines when setting up the infrastructure. This can lead to open and accessible EC2 security groups, public S3 buckets, unprotected EMR clusters, and more,” says Auth0 Detection and Response Security Engineer Troy Wegner (formerly of AWS and Amazon.com).</p></blockquote><ol start="3"><li><strong><a href="https://www.overops.com/blog/static-vs-dynamic-code-analysis-how-to-choose-between-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Perform static</a> and <a href="https://www.overops.com/blog/static-vs-dynamic-code-analysis-how-to-choose-between-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dynamic code analysis</a></strong>. Static analysis reviews the code as it exists. Dynamic analysis looks for vulnerabilities while the code is being executed and for unexpected outcomes. Ideally, you want to move towards baking both into your Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Devs may not always enjoy adding this to part of their process—more on how to add this analysis to your long-term software development plans in the final post.</li><li><strong>Think through vulnerability management and updates</strong>. Since humans are fallible and it’s humans who make code, it’s inevitable that you’re going to run into vulnerabilities. If you don’t have a plan for pushing updates, now’s the time to make one so you don’t hear about something BIG like the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2014/6/19/18076318/heartbleed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heartbleed Bug</a> and find yourself painfully updating ad-hoc.</li></ol><blockquote><p>In general, you’re going to need to test every time your devs update something and whenever your tech stack libraries or any of the main operating systems updates. Services like Chef, Puppet and Terraform can make this easier by pushing updates from a central server to connected servers. In the final post, we’ll get into longer-term strategies for updates, like maintaining a Golden Amazon Machine Image (AMI) if you’re on AWS. For now, just document how and when you’re going to update and test.</p></blockquote><ol start="5"><li><strong>Threat model</strong>. A lot of security is determining risks. Ideally, you’ve threat modeled before building your app, but in some ways, it’s easier to model after it’s live. Yes, you can hire a trusted third party to do this for you. To give you a sense of the thought process, I asked Troy to threat model this restaurant scenario. Security engineers often diagram vulnerabilities, so we also include Troy’s whiteboard as a reference.</li></ol><p>Let’s say you’re a local restaurant who responded to COVID by offering the ingredients to make your tastiest dishes and recipes to your customers via curbside pickup. You hired someone to put the app together quickly, but now your region is opening up, and you’ve decided this channel of operations should continue contributing to your bottom line. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/23aumh6u8s0i/3qWEruezG4YZw2AwS2w4Nf/ccb3121e94d794c8baa0ec470e4b084d/diagram.jpg" alt="Whiteboard"/>
<strong>Figure 1:</strong> <em>Auth0 Senior Security Engineer - Detection and Response Troy Wegner’s whiteboard of our restaurant scenario.</em></p><ul><li>Start with authentication because you know customers need to authenticate in order to interact with your app. How are they authenticating? Are they only using a username and password? If they are only using a username and password for authentication, then you have just hit on your first major risk (user compromise/phishing/user impersonation).</li><li>As a way to address the first risk identified, you have chosen to go with two-factor authentication for your users. But here is where things get interesting; which 2-factor options do you want to support? There are authenticator apps, FIDO U2F, Push-based 2FA, and SMS (the weakest available option). Each option has its own pros and cons to consider.</li><li>Since this is a restaurant, you’re also somehow connecting the app to the food supply. How are you measuring and validating your existing ingredients inventory to ensure you do not oversell based on your total ingredients available? Are you using a database to store this information? If so, where does this database live, is it protected or hardened information security wise, and if so, how is it hardened? How do you authenticate to the database, is it updated regularly, do you perform backups, etc.</li><li>If your service has gotten really popular, too many people might try to order at once, and that could overwhelm the app’s limits. The app could go down due to resource constraints based on how it is architected. This is basically the risk a DOS/DDOS would present in bringing your app down and making it no longer available to your customers. In order to mitigate a DDOS risk, you might have a plan to make your app more fault tolerant and highly available by using load balancing, increasing back-end servers to handle the load, or using a front-end CDN to help distribute load across various edge locations.</li><li>Most likely, your app is taking payment and processing it in order to fulfill orders; how are customer payment and other sensitive information being handled/stored? If you accept credit cards or debit cards, PCI compliance is a concern you should address.</li><li>Here is where you would now want to think through and fully diagram out the rest of how the app works and uncover any other risks or bottlenecks that currently exist with your app, place a severity on those risks, and determine by severity which risks you want to fix, and which ones you are ok accepting.</li></ul><ol start="6"><li><strong>Turn on your logs — and make sure they’re monitored</strong>. Turning on logs can seem like common sense, but because there’s often an expense attached to logging and getting the data analyzed, the logs might not always be turned on. It’s really hard to know what to fix after a malware outbreak or other issues occur, especially if your logs aren’t turned on and are being actively analyzed.</li></ol><p>So this is where we tell you to turn on the logs for all the services you’re using. You should also make sure that a trusted third-party vendor or trained security engineer is watching your logs and building actionable detections based on those log sources to look for suspicious or anomalous activity.</p><ol start="7"><li><strong>Take action</strong>. Logs, vulnerability assessments, pen tests — these things can help you identify what needs to be fixed, but you still need to fix it. Breaches and ransomware are the obvious security problems you want to avoid. How your security challenges impact consumer behavior might not be as clear. Lost conversions, abandoned shopping carts, and low time on site are all indications that your target audience may not feel comfortable sharing their data with you. Our customers tell us that an app or site that feels secure (think smooth login, logical and smooth payment process) supports their business goals.</li></ol><h2 id="If-You-Need-More-Help">If You Need More Help</h2><p>Authentication is often a critical part of securing an app or workplace.
