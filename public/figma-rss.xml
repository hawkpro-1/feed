      <title>How Elsewhen builds digital products for their clients</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-elsewhen-builds-digital-products-for-their-clients/</link>
      <description>Learn about how Elsewhen helped their clients, Spotify and Inmarsat, improve their productivity through collaboration in Figma.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Figma, we believe that well-designed tools can make teams more productive, more effective, and happier, too. That same belief drives the team at <a href="https://www.elsewhen.com/">Elsewhen</a>, a digital product consultancy based in the UK that focuses on building B2B and enterprise tools for companies across industries and around the world. Elsewhen helps their clients identify broken systems and improve day-to-day operations with better tools. Empowered with the systems they need to focus on their work, their clients’ teams are able to build better products, solve harder problems, explore more freely, and ultimately build stronger organizations.</p><p>Because building tools requires close partnership with their clients, Elsewhen uses Figma as a collaborative home base to work and design together. “With Figma, we&#39;ve been able to remove loads of routine steps, such as exporting, uploading, and distributing assets,” says Tadhg McCarthy, Founder and Design Director at Elsewhen. “Figma is not just a tool for designing final product screens; we use it across the entire process from exploration and workshopping, to prototyping with our clients.”</p><p>Learn more about how Elsewhen uses Figma in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANRysL9XH">“In the file” livestream</a>.</p><p>Here’s how Elsewhen helped their clients, Spotify and Inmarsat, improve their productivity through collaboration in Figma.</p><h2 id="improving-productivity-and-creativity-at-spotify"><a href="#improving-productivity-and-creativity-at-spotify">Improving productivity and creativity at Spotify</a></h2><p>How can design organizations better measure and evaluate designer productivity? And how can we improve it without compromising the creative process? These are the kinds of questions that Spotify was grappling with at the start of last year. “Measuring productivity for a creative role,” the Spotify design team wrote in a <a href="https://spotify.design/article/measuring-defining-and-improving-productivity-the-design-productivity">recent blog post</a>, “is a treacherous undertaking. For example, it would be a mistake to just count the number of screens, components or even solutions a designer creates, or the time it takes them to produce each one, so we need to identify the metrics that it does make sense to measure.” Driven by the idea that improving design productivity could be the key to unlocking design creativity, Spotify tapped Elsewhen.</p><p><br/>Together, they created a framework that would help design teams understand current workflow challenges and locate key opportunities—the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/934395237081404612">Design Productivity Blueprint</a>. The framework is an open-sourced Figma file that contains a collection of workshops and interview templates that any team can use. With the tool, Spotify and Elsewhen hope that they’ll help design teams spend more of their time designing and less time on the tasks that slow them down.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3e8df3e9fbadd36d7023ff4ed05dd8eed7f928c1-512x423.png?w=670&amp;h=554&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3e8df3e9fbadd36d7023ff4ed05dd8eed7f928c1-512x423.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3e8df3e9fbadd36d7023ff4ed05dd8eed7f928c1-512x423.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3e8df3e9fbadd36d7023ff4ed05dd8eed7f928c1-512x423.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 512w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="building-a-foundational-design-system-for-inmarsat"><a href="#building-a-foundational-design-system-for-inmarsat">Building a foundational design system for Inmarsat</a></h2><p>Inmarsat is a British telecommunications company that keeps the world connected through satellite communication networks. While they’re able to deliver world-class communication solutions across cities and companies—even ships and planes—around the world, they’re not immune from the challenges of being a distributed workforce. Across their many offices, building and evolving their products as a team was proving to be quite difficult, particularly when it came to design.</p><p>Inmarsat doesn’t have an internal design team, so they rely on agencies for design partnership. While this model can offer greater flexibility to meet changing needs over time, it can also lead to a disconnect between in-house developers and new designers who may not have sufficient context or tools. And because Inmarsat didn’t have a single source of truth for their most commonly used design components, files, and assets, onboarding and managing these designers was a heavy lift. “They were constantly rebuilding components from scratch,” recalls Matt Soczywko, Head of Marketing at Elsewhen. “This of course prolonged the process in which they shipped products.”</p><p>To change this, Inmarsat began working with Elsewhen, who was tasked with creating their first design system in Figma. “To develop their design system, we used an ongoing project that Inmarsat was already working on—a self-service portal for their enterprise customers,” Elsewhen’s founder, Tadhg McCarthy, explained. “This gave us the foundational elements that would form the new component libraries.”</p><p>From there, the Elsewhen team developed a framework for common components like type, buttons, icons, grids, and more. “Not only was there now a source of truth for our design components in Figma, all the designers and developers across the organization and our partnering agencies can now easily access critical design assets,” said Brandon James, Director of Marketing, Inmarsat. “Now as a business, we’re building new products faster and staying ahead of the curve of technological change.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?rect=0,0,1023,678&amp;w=670&amp;h=444&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/63dbe28981e2604a9cea0e4d057cae9ddc6e16ff-1024x678.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1023w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="7d26fbf1ebaf" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>To learn more about how Elsewhen helps companies design products that improve workflows, increase efficiency, and ultimately make people happier at work <a href="https://www.elsewhen.com/blog">check out their blog</a>.

      <description>Learn more about what to expect, and apply to attend</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Today, we’re opening registration for Schema, Figma’s user conference on all things design systems. <a href="https://schema.figma.com/">Check out speakers and the agenda</a>, and read on to learn more about what to expect.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="c27d12570e4a" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Over the last decade, there has been an explosion of interest, technology, and communities built around design systems. As organizations of all sizes scale their design operations, systems play a critical role in enabling product teams to move faster, more consistently, and adapt to evolving business needs.</p><p>Back when I first learned about systems as a designer, everything was much more static and linear. Designers built and shared PDF style guides, which served as documentation for reusable design decisions. Developers interpreted those guides into a stylesheet that closely resembled decisions in code. These workflows were often siloed across tools and teams, making alignment challenging—particularly amongst design adjacent collaborators. (If you’ve ever received mockups of rectangles in a slide deck, you know what I’m talking about!)</p><p>We have come a long way since then. Today, the landscape is built around collaboration, visibility, and flexible tooling—all in the name of creating shared understanding. During my time at Figma, I’ve have had the opportunity to meet so many amazing design systems practitioners, from those working on smaller teams where their design system is a grassroots effort, to others at large organizations with dedicated design systems and operations teams. </p><p>Above all, they’re deeply motivated by helping others. They take great pride in building systems that allow teams to spend less time thinking about organization and processes, and more on solving tough problems. And what’s even more encouraging is that cross-functional contributors, who may have never found themselves in a design tool five years ago, are now more integrated into the design process.</p><p>At Figma, we think a lot about these challenges through the lens of the product. Libraries, components and styles are part of it, but we also know how important communication, measurement, and contribution are to the people creating resources to help others. And if there’s one thing we’ve learned, everyone—regardless of their organization’s scale—is still figuring it out!</p><p>That&#39;s why we’ve created a space to do just that. Introducing: <a href="https://schema.figma.com/"><strong>Schema</strong></a>, a conference focused on building, scaling, and contributing to design systems.</p><h2 id="here-is-everything-you-need-to-know"><a href="#here-is-everything-you-need-to-know">Here is everything you need to know:</a></h2><p><strong>When:</strong> October 7, 2021 at 8:30am PT<br/><strong>Where:</strong> Virtual<br/></p><h3 id="who-should-apply"><a href="#who-should-apply">Who should apply</a></h3><p>This event is for you if you’re:</p><ul><li>A design systems or design ops leader</li><li>Formalizing your first design system or working on design systems at scale</li><li>On a team looking to expand and customize your workflows with tooling on Figma APIs</li></ul><h3 id="how-to-attend"><a href="#how-to-attend">How to attend</a></h3><p>We are aiming to create a conference where meaningful conversations can happen.

      <description>Tips from the Figma security team to help other teams secure Systems Manager and protect their most sensitive data</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Last year, the Figma security team built a simple solution for zero-trust shell access on AWS. To do this, they leveraged AWS SSO and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/">Systems Manager</a>, an umbrella of services that provide monitoring and remote administration capabilities over various AWS resources. In this post, Security Engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/hongyihu">Hongyi Hu</a> explains how the team designed the system and shares some tips to help other teams secure Systems Manager and protect their most sensitive data.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="2bbf93c25de5" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>In order to protect production environments, many companies require engineers to use Secure Shell (SSH) to log in through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host">bastion host</a>. Hackers love to target critical security controls like this to break into production and steal user data.</p><p>At Figma, we used this approach, too, for a few years. But as we scaled, managing and securing access became difficult and increasingly time consuming. So in mid-2020, we decided to build our own modern, zero-trust shell access system that’s more secure, easy to support, and simple to use. Here, I’ll share the story of how we built and rolled out this project, along with detailed advice so you can try this approach yourself.</p><p>When designing our system, we had a few important goals in mind. My teammate, Max, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-securing-internal-web-apps/">previously shared some values</a> that reflect our approach as a security team. Here is how they came to life in this project:</p><ul><li><strong>Smooth user experience.</strong> Our system should be easy to use and reliable, empowering our teammates to be productive and secure.</li><li><strong>Zero-trust principles.</strong> We believe that using zero-trust networking principles, if applied correctly, results in fewer systems to maintain and a clear security model that is easier to reason about.</li><li><strong>Strong, modern authentication capabilities.</strong> We wanted to enforce SSO with phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication and limit the “blast radius” of stolen keys with short-lived, automatically rotating credentials.</li><li><strong>Centralized logging and auditing.</strong> We need to be able to easily investigate and trace actions taken by an individual user.</li><li><strong>Minimal toil.</strong> Our system should be simple to build, deploy, and easy to maintain.</li><li><strong>Incremental and backwards-compatible.</strong> Our rollout plan should allow for incremental improvements and support existing use cases. It should avoid drastic changes and disruption to our teammates.</li></ul><h2 id="when-out-of-the-box-solutions-won-t-work"><a href="#when-out-of-the-box-solutions-won-t-work">When out-of-the-box solutions won’t work</a></h2><p>During our initial investigation, we evaluated commercial solutions like Okta Advanced Server Access. However, they weren’t flexible enough to support existing use cases easily and weren’t always available to us at our size. We were also concerned that external dependencies would add unnecessary complexity and introduce a potential source of availability risk into critical engineering workflows. Since we already used many AWS services in our infrastructure, we instead decided to explore building a simple, proof-of-concept design, using AWS components as building blocks.</p><p>Enter: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/">AWS Systems Manager</a>, a set of operational tools for AWS infrastructure. For our purposes, Systems Manager can provide shell access to EC2 and ECS instances through a feature called <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager.html">Session Manager</a>, where the instances don’t need to expose a SSH port or be accessible by any external networks at all. I won’t rehash other <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-session-manager/">blog posts</a> that deep-dive into Session Manager, but in a nutshell, it creates and manages authenticated and encrypted TLS connections between an agent on a managed instance and the user’s client, like the AWS console or a CLI tool. Session Manager connections support running commands, starting an interactive shell, and even tunneling SSH sessions. Permissions can be centrally managed through IAM roles assumable by human users authenticating through AWS SSO.</p><h2 id="sso-and-access-control-leveraging-existing"><a href="#sso-and-access-control-leveraging-existing">SSO and access control: leveraging existing investments</a></h2><p>At a high level, we use Okta, our SSO provider, with AWS SSO to provide strong, centrally managed authentication with required device trust and required WebAuthN for multi-factor authentication. (For more details on how we rolled out WebAuthN at Figma, check out <a href="https://twitter.com/frgx/status/1379504541666701313">this thread</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/frgx">Dev</a>, who leads our team.) After authenticating, users assume a dedicated, minimally-privileged IAM role with short-lived AWS access tokens to begin a shell session via Session Manager. For auditing, Session Manager collects and sends session transcripts to an encrypted S3 bucket.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?rect=0,0,1792,963&amp;w=670&amp;h=360&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68fdb732c45a889ac6e5e1fdc4f08e108abbe45a-1792x964.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Integrating <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/okta-idp.html">Okta with AWS SSO</a> with group push was straightforward, and it allows our IT team to easily manage access control with Okta groups. Once SSO is set up, users who prefer a web experience can immediately start using Session Manager in the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-sessions-start.html#start-sys-console">AWS Systems Manager console</a>, while those who prefer using a terminal can use <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-getting-out-of-the-secure-shell/#for-cli-fans">a simple CLI tool that we built</a>.</p><p>One consideration when using AWS SSO is that it’s possible for attackers to conduct device code phishing (<a href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/phishing-for-aws-credentials-via-aws-sso-device-code-authentication/">see this excellent blog post</a>). At a high level, an attacker could generate their own device authorization URL and attempt to trick a victim into visiting that URL and authorizing that request in order to retrieve an access token for the victim. Although engineers should find it suspicious to encounter an unprompted SSO page, we also added monitoring and alerts as additional mitigations for this scenario.</p><h2 id="setting-up-session-manager"><a href="#setting-up-session-manager">Setting Up Session Manager</a></h2><p>AWS has detailed guides for setting up Session Manager for <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-getting-started.html">EC2</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/new-using-amazon-ecs-exec-access-your-containers-fargate-ec2/">ECS</a>. If you’d prefer not to pore over the docs, here is a detailed collection of tips that might save you some time:</p><h3 id="configuring-iam-policies-for-session-manager"><a href="#configuring-iam-policies-for-session-manager">Configuring IAM policies for Session Manager</a></h3><p>Session Manager uses separate sets of IAM permissions for both user roles and target resources; this allows you to craft minimally privileged policies scoped to specific target resources. For example, for EC2, the target instance must have permissions to create and open SSM message channels, and the user IAM role must have SSM session permissions on the target instance.</p><p>Similarly, for ECS, the task definition needs SSM message channel permissions, and the user IAM role must have <code>ExecuteCommand</code> permissions on the target container. ECS also requires a new KMS CMK, and key permissions must be configured to encrypt session logs.</p><h3 id="adding-guardrails-for-users"><a href="#adding-guardrails-for-users">Adding guardrails for users</a></h3><p>For defense-in-depth, you can restrict IAM permissions to access or modify SSM documents, such as <code>SSM-SessionManagerRunShell</code> or <code>AWS-StartSSHSession</code>, to prevent users from getting a shell or tunneling SSH, or to require that your users use your own customized SSM configuration if you wish to restrict specific SSM workflows.</p><p>If you prefer to only expose certain commands to users, SSM <code>RunCommand</code> can be used to construct safe one-off invocations instead of providing a full interactive shell. For example, we use this feature in our deploy process to replace operations previously done via SSH connections and keys accessible by scripts.</p><h3 id="customizing-ec2-instances"><a href="#customizing-ec2-instances">Customizing EC2 instances</a></h3><p>You should configure <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-preferences-run-as.html">the username</a> and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-getting-started-ssm-user-permissions.html">sudo permissions</a> of the system account being logged into. You may also want to use <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-preferences-shell-config.html">configurable shell profiles</a> because, by default, users are dropped into a bare Bourne shell without any customized environment configurations that they might expect.</p><h3 id="logging"><a href="#logging">Logging</a></h3><p>You may want to send logs to an encrypted S3 bucket or CloudTrail. Since logs contain a session ID, and assumed SSO IAM roles contain usernames, you can easily attribute individual sessions to human users. We send our logs to a separate account, use Service Control Policies to enforce encryption, block public access, and prevent deletion, and we monitor any read attempts. Note that if you use this, SSM will log <em>all</em> shell output, which might contain very sensitive data like secrets!</p><h3 id="locking-down-session-manager-even-if-you-don-t"><a href="#locking-down-session-manager-even-if-you-don-t">Locking down Session Manager, even if you don’t use it</a></h3><p>Because Session Manager is so powerful, it represents a potential attack surface into an AWS environment that should be carefully secured even if you’re not using the feature. For example, because <code>aws-ssm-agent</code> is pre-installed on many AMIs, an IAM user or role with sufficient Session Manager permissions can get a shell on an instance using that AMI, even if it has no configured network access.</p><p>Here are some of the main mitigations we implemented that you may want to consider, depending on your needs:</p><ul><li>Audit whether any IAM users have System Manager permissions. Better yet, completely migrate away from long-lived IAM users, if possible.</li><li>For human users, grant the minimum necessary System Manager permissions to only those IAM roles that need them, limit the session duration of those roles, and restrict which instances can be connected to. AWS Systems Manager encompasses a large number of different IAM permissions, most of which are not required to start a shell session. Be careful if you use a default AWS SSM IAM policy; some of them grant very broad permissions, including full S3 access!</li><li>For similar reasons, grant only the necessary System Manager permissions for instance or task definition IAM policies.</li></ul><h2 id="for-cli-fans"><a href="#for-cli-fans">For CLI fans</a></h2><p>For users who prefer a CLI, we configured a seamless experience tying web-based SSO with CLI tools. This workflow received overwhelming positive feedback from our users. As one Figma engineer said, “[This] is really fun to use. I wish all security measures were so low-friction.” Making security feel fun is high praise indeed!</p><figure><figcaption>​​A video of our CLI flow. Engineers only need to sign through the full SSO flow once a day because credentials are cached in aws-vault.</figcaption></figure><p>To set this up, we leveraged <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html">a feature of the AWS CLI</a> that automatically opens a web page to start the SSO flow when credentials are needed, and returns the credentials back to the CLI. For example, a user can set up their <code>~/.aws/config</code> like this:</p><div><pre><code><span>[profile sso_session_manager]
</span>sso_start_url=https://my-sso.awsapps.com/start
sso_region=us-east-1
sso_account_id=123456789011
sso_role_name=MY_SSO_SM_ROLE
sso_interactive_auth=true
</code></pre></div><p>With a tool like <a href="https://github.com/99designs/aws-vault/blob/master/USAGE.md">aws-vault</a> to securely manage temporary AWS credentials, we can easily script the process of starting a shell session. For example, to start a shell in an ECS container:</p><div><pre><code><span>aws-vault exec sso_session_manager --
</span>    aws ecs execute-command \
    --region us-east-1 \
    --cluster &lt;my_cluster&gt; \
    --task &lt;my-task-id&gt; \
    --container &lt;my-container-name&gt; \
    --command &#34;/bin/bash&#34; \
    --interactive
</code></pre></div><p>If SSH is needed for EC2, we can also configure SSH to use Session Manager as a proxy by adding entries to the user’s <code>~/.ssh/config</code> like this:</p><div><pre><code><span>host my-host.example.com
</span>    User ubuntu
    ProxyCommand sh -c &#34;aws-vault exec sso_session_manager -- aws ssm start-session --target &lt;my-ec2-instance-id&gt; --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters &#39;portNumber=%p&#39;&#34;
</code></pre></div><h2 id="rollout-deprecating-ssh"><a href="#rollout-deprecating-ssh">Rollout: deprecating SSH</a></h2><p>To rapidly deploy a useful solution with minimal disruption, it was important that we didn’t force large architectural or workflow changes right off the bat. Because some critical workflows like deploys depended heavily on SSH, we continued to support SSH connections but required tunneling through Session Manager, as I explained earlier. That resulted in both a usability win and a security win—existing users saw no real change to their normal SSH workflow aside from the new SSO requirement, and possessing an SSH key no longer granted SSH access by itself.</p><p>We gave users several weeks of notice to migrate to the new workflow while we allowed both tunneled SSH (SSH over SSM) and non-tunneled SSH (classic SSH) in the interim. That gave all users a grace period to switch over. After the deadline, we blocked all inbound connections from the internet (i.e., inbound SSH connections) to our bastions. This meant that SessionManager was now the only way to get shell access in our environment. To remain robust against potential SSM issues, a select few Figma engineers have the ability to remove these blocks in a break-glass situation, which will also fire off alerts for us.</p><p>One downside of tunneled SSH is that Session Manager acts only as a wrapper and thus cannot provide full session transcripts of the encrypted SSH traffic, so other tooling is needed to audit SSH connections. Instead, we eventually deprecated the need for tunneled SSH with a simple script as a convenient drop-in replacement for SSH. As described earlier, our script leverages the AWS CLI to call either <code>aws ssm start-session</code> for EC2 instances or <code>aws ecs execute-command</code> for ECS instances. Thus, our script <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/new-using-amazon-ecs-exec-access-your-containers-fargate-ec2/">works with containers</a>—whereas SSH does not—and allows developers to easily switch between different profiles used in our multi-account AWS environment. This script is now the standard way of safely getting shell access at Figma for the engineers who need it.</p><h2 id="empowering-teammates"><a href="#empowering-teammates">Empowering teammates</a></h2><p>We shipped a modern, reliable, secure shell access system built out of native AWS services to replace our old bastion design. Our new setup drastically reduces the operational overhead on our infrastructure and IT teams, empowering our fellow Figmates to be productive and secure. And after we rolled this out, other infrastructure projects at Figma, like our deployment tools, have started to leverage parts of our system such as using SSM <code>RunCommand</code> instead of SSH scripts for added security.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="9d83554f3525" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We are a small team, passionate about modernizing security practices and contributing to the broader community.

      <description>Introducing audio and cursor chat, two new ways to communicate without leaving Figma and FigJam</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Today, we launched <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500004414622">audio</a> and <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500004414842-Send-messages-with-cursor-chat">cursor chat</a>, introducing two new ways to communicate without leaving Figma and FigJam. Now, you can quickly add a question to your cursor or hop on a call to chat with your teammates while you’re working together in the same file. And if you’re jamming in FigJam, you can even high-five.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="13b374fc3379" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Since day one, Figma has opened the doors for teammates to work in the same file together. But working together sometimes requires more than just being in the same digital space. Like everyone, we’ve encountered our fair share of challenges when it comes to remote collaboration. We experienced the pain of switching between tools to ask that quick question or clarify one key point. So, we set out to solve those challenges, while bringing back the serendipity of in-person interactions.</p><p>We are introducing audio and cursor chat to recreate those magical moments—a spontaneous brainstorm at a teammate’s desk or a quick chair swivel to catch-up with a co-worker—directly in Figma and FigJam. And for those moments of joy when you figure something out in a jam session, you can even high five in FigJam.</p><h2 id="the-magic-of-in-person-in-the-file"><a href="#the-magic-of-in-person-in-the-file">The magic of in-person, in the file</a></h2><p>When we started building audio and cursor chat, top of mind was creating a single space for users to interact with each other, so they don’t have to toggle between other tools. This additional level of collaboration needed to be fast and low-friction; teams shouldn’t need to download something, configure settings, or add an additional step like dialing a phone number or sending out a calendar invite.</p><p>Above all, we want to complement—not replace—existing workflows. While these new ways to communicate in a file are built to enable synchronous collaboration, we know that some collaboration will be asynchronous, requiring teammates to work independently before getting input from others. Whatever your workflows look like, here are a few ways audio and cursor chat can help you jam, brainstorm, and workshop—together:</p><h3 id="in-context-collaboration"><a href="#in-context-collaboration">In-context collaboration</a></h3><p>If you get stuck or want to workshop something live, you can share the link to the file and talk it out. Audio and cursor chat both allow you to share thoughts and feedback in real time in Figma and FigJam.</p><h3 id="lightweight-jam-sessions"><a href="#lightweight-jam-sessions">Lightweight jam sessions</a></h3><p>There are times when video makes meetings more human, and there are times when you just don’t need it. Rather than jumping on a video call for a brainstorm, you can use audio and cursor chat to jam together, without switching between apps. You can <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/964652140702534507">start with a template</a>, <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/4402269549591-Stay-on-track-with-the-timer-in-FigJam">set a timer</a>, and get to work.</p><h3 id="spontaneous-syncs"><a href="#spontaneous-syncs">Spontaneous syncs</a></h3><p>Instead of a chance encounter in the hallway, you can “run into” a colleague in a file and riff on a design, ask a quick question, or request feedback to work through a problem. Saying hello through your cursor or hopping on a quick audio call can help your team regain those lost moments of serendipity in a remote world.</p><figure><figcaption>Invite your teammate over cursor chat before chatting with them over audio</figcaption></figure><p>Audio, cursor chat, and high fives are just the start. We want everyone in our community to be able to join the conversation. That’s why in a few weeks, we plan to launch live captions in open beta on the Figma desktop app. This will allow us to collect <a href="https://form.asana.com/?k=FPQgFCXUINQN6CmMtWiabQ&amp;d=10497086658021">feedback</a> and improve the feature as we continue to build new ways for users to communicate—and collaborate—with each other.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="a0decd48f168" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500004414842-Send-messages-with-cursor-chat">Cursor chat</a> is now available to everyone in both Figma and FigJam.

      <title>Figma for students and educators</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-for-students-and-educators/</link>
      <description>How Figma can help during this back-to-school season</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In many ways, being a Designer Advocate for Education is a dream role for me. While I’ve pivoted back and forth from product design and education throughout my career, I was most recently an Assistant Professor at the Rochester Institute of Technology, where I taught interaction design classes. As an educator, I saw firsthand how students can learn valuable design skills in Figma and wanted to help others adopt the platform that was so inspiring to me. In fact, last year when <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/bringing-figma-to-even-more-classrooms/">Figma expanded Figma for Education</a>, I was still teaching at RIT. I partnered with the team here to <a href="https://www.figma.com/@miggi">publish teaching materials</a>, based on class activities and lessons I would give to students.</p><p>This year marks my first “back to school” season since joining Figma, and I wanted to share some reflections, including ways that Figma can support educators and students alike. Figma’s Education plan gives students and educators the ability to create teams with all the Professional perks completely free, with unlimited collaboration. Starting today, we’re also are making it easier for classrooms to collaborate with new, simplified onboarding processes.</p><h2 id="for-educators-enabling-a-virtual-classroom"><a href="#for-educators-enabling-a-virtual-classroom">For educators: enabling a virtual classroom</a></h2><p>Introducing Figma to my User Experience classes back in 2018 marked a paradigm shift in my pedagogy. It was not only a tool that facilitated learning and development, but also a space where we gathered, ran activities, and shared feedback on each other’s work. Here is how other educators and I have seen Figma change the way we teach:</p><ul><li><strong>Support for different styles of teaching.</strong> When everyone had to shift to remote learning last year, I was so grateful that my class was already using Figma—the only thing that changed was the location. As educators adapt to accommodate the combination of in person and remote work, real-time and asynchronous collaboration, Figma makes it so anyone can participate.</li><li><strong>A single source of truth for class materials.</strong> By aggregating all work in Figma, it’s easy to track conversations and assignments. For example, instructors <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHtEf0HkCzY">Steph Kotula and Rian Long</a> of Portland State University used one Figma file with multiple pages as a space for all lectures, design activities, and critiques. It serves as an artifact, allowing students to reference class materials or catch up on missed lessons.</li><li><strong>More engaged, inclusive classrooms.</strong> The magic of Figma happens when there’s more than one person in a file and the ideas start to flow, allowing teams to riff, iterate, and build on each other’s work. In my own classroom, new dynamics emerged and social norms changed—I noticed that some of my quiet students begin to participate more actively. Deaf and hard of hearing students told me that the visual format enabled a more level playing field. Creating channels for active participation in varying formats opens doors for more collaboration.</li><li><strong>A space for community.</strong> Particularly in this time of hybrid remote and in-person learning, fostering a sense of togetherness is important. <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/julianne-burke/26667">Julianne Burke</a>, who teaches a course on the foundations of UX/UI, has her students create a yearbook in Figma. Students in each cohort post headshots, leave encouraging comments, and add stickers to each other’s pages. She exports them as PDFs for the students to keep after the course is over.</li></ul><p>If you&#39;d like to learn more about using Figma as an educator, <a href="https://figma.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_c_RbC2ZNTjec-9ZCwEsUqg">sign up for a group demo</a>. I will be hosting a conversation for us to share classroom templates, answer questions, and just get to know each other.</p><h2 id="for-students-developing-career-building"><a href="#for-students-developing-career-building">For students: developing career-building competencies</a></h2><p>Students studying design today need to close the gap between what they learn in class and the skills they will need day one on the job. Here is how I’ve seen Figma help students do just that:</p><ul><li><strong>Exposure to relevant tools and practical skills.</strong> The design process has shifted from a linear model to one that’s much more collaborative and cross-functional. Modeling this way of working in Figma in the classroom allows students to get comfortable opening up their own processes, introducing them to social dynamics and workflows that will serve them well in the workplace.</li><li><strong>Opportunities to develop portfolios.</strong> Every design interview contains the portfolio review, a chance for candidates to show not just the final result, but also the process of how they got there. With Figma, students can keep track of their many iterations, research, and process along the way.</li><li><strong>Connections to the community.</strong> Every designer I know credits a lot of their progress to learning from other designers. Joining <a href="https://friends.figma.com">Friends of Figma</a> student groups, getting involved in programs like <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/OBh5ECsc9ytSuoXHSewJDK/Hackathon-Program-Application?scaling=scale-down&amp;node-id=565%3A680&amp;starting-point-node-id=565%3A680">Figma’s Hackathon Program</a>, or learning from others by duplicating and remixing files in the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/">Figma Community</a> are all meaningful ways to come together.</li></ul><p>When you <a href="https://www.figma.com/education/">sign up for Figma</a>, you can opt in to get emails from us. We send a quarterly newsletter highlighting seasonally relevant opportunities like ramping up for hiring season, portfolio reviews, and getting the most out of your internship.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="43be0c78db77" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>If you’re a student or educator, <a href="https://www.figma.com/education/">learn more about Figma for Education</a>.

      <title>Rethinking a design thinking workshop for good</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/rethinking-a-design-thinking-workshop-for-good/</link>
      <description>How students at Design the Future used FigJam to solve challenges for people living with disabilities</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://designthefuture.squarespace.com/">Design the Future</a> is a two-week long summer program that immerses high school students in design thinking, encouraging them to use design to solve real world problems. By building products that solve challenges for people living with disabilities, students get hands-on design experience while making a positive impact.</p><p>For the past six years, program creator <a href="https://www.dcdesignltd.com/about">Durrell Coleman</a> has partnered with institutions like the <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/">Stanford d.school</a> and Boston University to run in-person workshops across the U.S. During each session, four high school students pair up with a university coach and a project partner—someone who shares the unique challenges they face living with a disability. In turn, the students design solutions to those obstacles through the lens of their project partner’s perspective.</p><p>Over the last two summers, the in-person format wasn’t an option. So, Coleman and the Design the Future team set out to rethink the approach for an all-remote environment.</p><p>Knowing that the program would require eight hours of online collaboration each day, avoiding Zoom fatigue was top of mind. For this to work, the Design the Future team had to find a tool that was easy, intuitive, and one that students genuinely enjoyed using.</p><p>First, the team tested Figma because it had all of the features Coleman needed to create workspaces for student activities. But, it would be tough for the students to spin up on Figma, given the short duration of the workshop. Instead, they transitioned to Figma’s online whiteboard, <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a>. FigJam was quick for students to pick up, allowed for interactivity in the file, and Coleman could copy and paste the templates he already made in Figma straight into FigJam.</p><div><blockquote><p>“FigJam was a game changer for us. We were able to get over 100 students working collaboratively as a group and in small teams to share ideas and design apps that truly made a difference for people with disabilities.”</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="organizing-with-team-whiteboards"><a href="#organizing-with-team-whiteboards">Organizing with team whiteboards</a></h2><p>The program is centered on the design process, from start (gathering requirements, gaining empathy for their user) to finish (a shippable app that solves their user’s needs). There are a number of steps in the design process that require different altitudes of feedback; learning how to manage and incorporate input along the way is central to the program’s teachings.</p><p>That’s why Coleman created one ultimate FigJam team whiteboard to guide students through the process. After building designs in Figma, he migrated them into FigJam to serve as templates. These designs acted as an activity worksheet for every step in the process, offering structure for students, while still giving them an open space for freeform iteration and collaboration.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cabe4580c9a75008ac77456d4e9e08dc614637b7-2680x1200.png?w=670&amp;h=300&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cabe4580c9a75008ac77456d4e9e08dc614637b7-2680x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cabe4580c9a75008ac77456d4e9e08dc614637b7-2680x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cabe4580c9a75008ac77456d4e9e08dc614637b7-2680x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cabe4580c9a75008ac77456d4e9e08dc614637b7-2680x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cabe4580c9a75008ac77456d4e9e08dc614637b7-2680x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>FigJam was the single source of truth for the students and their teams</figcaption></figure><p>Beyond learning valuable skills, Coleman wanted students to have fun and connect with one another. To that end, he turned FigJam into a shared activity space. Between project work, students got to know each other in larger groups through various icebreakers and collaborative activities. From sharing their hometown on a map to the <a href="https://www.ideo.com/blog/build-your-creative-confidence-thirty-circles-exercise">&#34;30 circles&#34; challenge popularized by IDEO</a>, these activities enabled FigJam to become a virtual lunchroom.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6a1cb154820bb3290ba8895360076fe48b9f36af-2680x1276.png?w=670&amp;h=319&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6a1cb154820bb3290ba8895360076fe48b9f36af-2680x1276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6a1cb154820bb3290ba8895360076fe48b9f36af-2680x1276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6a1cb154820bb3290ba8895360076fe48b9f36af-2680x1276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6a1cb154820bb3290ba8895360076fe48b9f36af-2680x1276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6a1cb154820bb3290ba8895360076fe48b9f36af-2680x1276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A snapshot of the &#34;30 circles&#34; challenge the team did in FigJam</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-greatest-lesson-empathy"><a href="#the-greatest-lesson-empathy">The greatest lesson?

As tenth-grader Analisa put it, “I really like that we get to use something that we are passionate about or interested in (STEM) to help make a change in someone&#39;s life… I got to work with people from different backgrounds and perspectives…” While the program was rooted in design, the students, coaches, and project partners ultimately learned something more important—a greater understanding for each other.</p><p><a href="https://designthefuture.squarespace.com/">Learn more about Design the Future</a> and <a href="https://www.youdesignthefuture.com/">check out the students&#39; final presentations</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>FIT’s principles for fostering a collaborative classroom</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/fits-principles-for-fostering-a-collaborative-classroom/</link>
      <description>Best practices from professors at the Fashion Institute of Technology on how to construct a virtual classroom in Figma</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keeping pace with rapidly changing technology isn’t just a challenge for the students in design school—it’s tough for the professors, too. Tasked with preparing the next generation of innovators, educators must constantly evolve their curriculums stay relevant and up-to-date with the needs of a demanding industry.</p><p>When it comes to providing students with a creative, forward-looking curriculum, The Fashion Institute of Technology has always led the way. In fact, just two years after the first iPhone launched, FIT had a user experience design course up and running. Professors <a href="https://www.fitnyc.edu/graphic-design/faculty/christie-shin.php">Christie Shin</a> and <a href="https://www.fitnyc.edu/advertising-design/faculty/cj-yeh.php">C.J. Yeh</a> led that charge, and each of them continues to push programming at FIT today. Here, we’ll dive into Professor Shin’s courses in the Advertising and Digital Design program.</p><p>In everything she does, Shin emphasizes the importance of teaching systems thinking, facilitating tight feedback loops, and providing an environment where ideas can be exchanged openly among students. Naturally, collaboration is core to that approach—which is why Figma has become an increasingly central component of her classroom workflows. In her UI course, for example, Shin constructs a virtual classroom in Figma. She organizes it into <a href="https://www.figma.com/best-practices/getting-started-with-teams-in-figma-organization/#:~:text=In%20Figma%20Organization%20you%20can,file%20organization%20and%20user%20permissions.&amp;text=A%20team%20can%20have%20its,levels%20of%20visibility%20within%20Figma.">Figma teams</a> that correspond to each lecture section. Then she further groups her course materials into <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005554982-Guide-to-files-and-projects">Figma projects</a> and asks the class to gather together directly in the files during lectures.</p><figure></figure><p>She kicks off the semester with icebreaker activities like creating interactive student profiles. As the course progresses, she provides an organized structure to learn and develop design skills. In the process, she has developed four principles for facilitating collaborative design in the classroom.</p><h2 id="professor-shin-s-principles-for-a-collaborative"><a href="#professor-shin-s-principles-for-a-collaborative">Professor Shin’s principles for a collaborative virtual classroom</a></h2><h3 id="_1-celebrate-early-work"><a href="#_1-celebrate-early-work">1. Celebrate early work</a></h3><p>You don’t have to be a designer to know that it can feel intimidating to share ideas before they’re ready. But in Shin’s class, students work in open team environments, and they’re encouraged to embrace that discomfort on a daily basis. To help them develop a muscle for requesting and responding to early feedback, she encourages students to frequently pop into each other’s work to share input out loud and in the file during each class.</p><div><blockquote><p>“Working together in Figma helps students understand that design is a way of thinking rather than the creation of a precious object.”</p></blockquote></div><h3 id="_2-guide-the-process-while-providing-room-to-grow"><a href="#_2-guide-the-process-while-providing-room-to-grow">2. Guide the process while providing room to grow</a></h3><p>For Shin’s students, everything from class exercises to final presentations live in Figma. At the top of the semester, students receive a set of files, each containing pages of named templates for the various activities in the course. While each page focuses around a purposeful and structured template, the infinite canvas around it leaves space open for sketches, ideas, and quick iterations. This makes it easy for students to turn a single Figma file into a design journal—one page might hold a research activity and a summary, while the next contains wireframes. Shin calls each of her students’ Figma files a “creative journey.”</p><figure></figure><h3 id="_3-work-individually-together"><a href="#_3-work-individually-together">3. Work individually, together</a></h3><p>Even for solo projects, students work within study groups. In one exercise last year, Shin tasked each student with creating a design system for the MTA app, complete with a video case study. The students met in their study groups to present their progress and, rather than waiting for feedback during the final presentation, exchanged feedback incrementally. This structure more closely echoes real-world design workplaces, where professionals work on cross-functional teams and hold formal <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-critiques-at-figma/">design critiques</a>. In order for students to produce their best work, Shin says, they need to feel less precious about their designs and develop a habit of continuously adding in feedback from peers.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;h=324&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d46ca7c3d1dee2ed251b9a37cb2dbdacdad78d47-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="_4-embrace-your-influences"><a href="#_4-embrace-your-influences">4. Embrace your influences</a></h3><p>Designers are inherently influenced by other designers and each other. Before using Figma, students had a tendency to hide work and not share until the end, worried that someone else might steal their idea. Shin focuses on the idea that it’s okay—and expected—for work to be shaped by others. Rather than thinking about it as stealing ideas, she reframes it as a central part of the design process.</p><p>She equally emphasizes the importance of recognizing and giving credit to students’ influences. On each project, students are required to collect images of designs, whether from professional designers or each other, that informed their work. This way, the discussion of influence is included within the project itself and can be discussed in its critique.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;h=324&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34e15eb67b378fd920ba11673e657fe4ba3c30f5-2680x1296.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="get-started"><a href="#get-started">Get started</a></h2><p>Take a deep dive with Professors Christie Shin and C.J.

      <title>What’s new in Figma: August 2021</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/whats-new-in-figma-august-2021/</link>
      <description>The features, fixes, and capabilities we&#39;ve added to Figma and FigJam</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Figma, our team is constantly obsessing over how we can improve the design experience. This is not just because we love our users (we do!) but also, selfishly, we run into a lot of these challenges firsthand. Since we’ve built Figma and FigJam <em>in</em> Figma and FigJam, we realize that certain parts of the design process can be faster, more interactive, or even automated. This leaves you with more time to focus on what you do best—creating.</p><p>To that end, over the last month we’ve released new features and capabilities—for design teams, by our design team—to help make working in Figma better. We have sped up workflows, made it easier to maintain your design systems, and introduced new ways to customize your experience in both Figma and FigJam. If you&#39;re interested in learning more, read on for the full recap:</p><p>We know no two jam sessions are alike. Sometimes, you need to think through a user journey with a teammate. Other times, you need to bring in more people to crowdsource and vote on ideas. To help make brainstorms and workshops more tailored to how you and your team collaborate, we’re bringing our open platform to FigJam—with plugins to automate workflows and widgets to engage the entire team.</p><p>Plugins make your individual workflows more efficient, whether you’re customizing styles, organizing stickies, or importing data. Widgets are interactive canvas objects that the entire team can use together. From voting and polls to notepads and games, widgets make facilitation a breeze and bring a spark of joy to every jam session.</p><p>Our plugin and widget APIs are flexible, allowing you to build for a variety of use cases. But we’ve also made it simple to get started. If you know basic HTML and Javascript, you can build a plugin. And if you’re familiar with React, you can build a widget.</p><p>Users on every plan can start building plugins today. You can also <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx40r8fC58dT5G93I_f8fkaaqO_6SQg2oWdFUf4riwqBu3ww/viewform">sign up</a> to start building widgets in a private beta. And for those of you excited to use plugins and widgets in your jams—stay tuned, they’ll be available soon!</p><p>Head on over to the <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/bringing-the-power-of-our-open-platform-to-figjam/">blog post</a> for all the details.</p><figure><figcaption>An example poll widget in FigJam</figcaption></figure><h2 id="expanding-our-figma-plugin-api-for-more-use-cases"><a href="#expanding-our-figma-plugin-api-for-more-use-cases">Expanding our Figma plugin API for more use cases and faster development</a></h2><p>In addition to bringing our open platform to FigJam, we’ve also updated our Figma plugin API, making it faster to build plugins—and available for more use cases.</p><p>The Figma plugin API now supports prototyping writes. This means developers can build plugins to automate the prototype creation process, or update and modify interactions in bulk. With this update, we hope to see plugins become a powerful tool to improve prototyping workflows, just like they are for design work. Check out our <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/intro/">API documentation</a> to start building yourself.</p><p>We also introduced a way to use <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/plugin-parameters/">quick actions to accept user input</a>, eliminating the need to create your own UI. Developers will now have a faster, simpler way to build more powerful plugins. Plugin parameters are now available in open beta.

While they make it easy for your team to move quickly, we know that sometimes managing and updating components and styles can be challenging. We released three new updates to components that make it easier to use and manage your design system:</p><ul><li><strong>Move components:</strong> You can now move published components and component sets between files, without breaking links to instances in your design system. This will make it easier to split large libraries up into smaller files or move published components to new files.</li><li><strong>Swap libraries:</strong> Our new swap libraries feature allows you to replace an entire set of styles with another, instead of individually making changes to the styles and components.</li><li><strong>Search components:</strong> We have created a new shortcut to help you get to the components you need faster. Use Shift + I (as in igloo) to quickly search for components.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1932a8314d6cafb30cff3d19c9077b8ee3a5b03-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1932a8314d6cafb30cff3d19c9077b8ee3a5b03-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1932a8314d6cafb30cff3d19c9077b8ee3a5b03-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1932a8314d6cafb30cff3d19c9077b8ee3a5b03-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1932a8314d6cafb30cff3d19c9077b8ee3a5b03-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1932a8314d6cafb30cff3d19c9077b8ee3a5b03-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Quickly search for components by pressing SHIFT + I</figcaption></figure><h2 id="solving-for-common-user-problems-in-figma"><a href="#solving-for-common-user-problems-in-figma">Solving for common user problems in Figma</a></h2><p>We also brought some exciting user experience updates to Figma, inspired by some of our team’s pet-peeves:</p><ul><li>Transparent objects now “knock out” shadows behind them by default, saving you an extra click (<a href="https://twitter.com/skuwamoto/status/1418243575297437697?s=20">sending you a box of tissues, Sho</a>)</li><li>You can now hold down Shift to draw straight lines with the pencil tool, in both Figma and FigJam (<a href="https://twitter.com/disco_lu/status/1418267147042701320?s=20">we can&#39;t wait to see those sqlobs, Luis</a>)</li></ul><p>You can see a full list of bug fixes and improvements in our <a href="https://releases.figma.com/">release notes</a>.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>We are opening up our platform and inviting all builders to create the first plugins and widgets for <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a>.

Our team was thoughtful about making this API approachable from the start—we knew designers and developers were excited about customizing their workflows, and we didn’t want the learning curve to feel prohibitive. That’s why one of our primary principles when building our plugin API was, “if you can build a website, you should be able to make a plugin.” If you know simple JavaScript and HTML, that’s enough to get started.</p><p>Today we’re bringing our open platform to FigJam with those same principles in mind. And because FigJam is all about jamming together, we’re taking it one step further by making sure our platform supports more collaborative use cases.</p><p>Plugins can be tremendously powerful for automating individual workflows, like turning a CSV into a grid of sticky notes or adding tags to sticky notes to help with synthesis. But for a collaborative tool like FigJam, we knew builders would also want an API that could enable collaborative and interactive experiences—from voting, to polls, to on-canvas games. That’s why we’re also releasing an API for building custom interactive widgets that teams can drag and drop directly into their boards.</p><figure><figcaption>An example poll widget that enables everyone in the file to vote across different options</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike plugins, the widget API is a declarative and functional API. It lets you define how your widget looks using a set of components (<code>&lt;Frame/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Rectangle/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Text/&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;SVG/&gt;</code> etc.) and add event listeners that can run arbitrary code on user interaction, such as click events. It also allows you to have custom in-line property menus just like native FigJam objects.</p><div><pre><code><span>// This widget consists of an auto layout frame and a number that increments </span><span>

We modeled this API after React and used a set of components that map to FigJam layers, but more closely match the properties of CSS. This means if you’re familiar with React you can immediately start building, even if you don’t have much prior knowledge of FigJam or Figma.</p><p>You might be wondering what you can actually build for FigJam, and which types of plugins and widgets our users have been asking for. We have worked with a small group of builders to test our plugin API, and talked to several users about the widgets and plugins that would help them most.</p><h2 id="create-plugins-that-speed-up-your-workflows"><a href="#create-plugins-that-speed-up-your-workflows">Create plugins that speed up your workflows</a></h2><p>Plugins are all about automating your workflows, allowing you to spend less time on menial tasks, and more time jamming with your team on ideas.</p><figure><figcaption>A plugin from Daniel Destefanis that lets you create stickies from text</figcaption></figure><p>There are a few types of plugins that users are eager to use in FigJam:</p><ul><li><strong>Organization and synthesis:</strong> Build plugins to organize, synthesize, and extract insights from objects on their boards. For example, you can sort sticky notes based on color, add tags for categorization, or extract themes from stickies via word clouds. We have several of these in the works—<a href="https://www.figma.com/@ae">Alex Einarsson</a> is building a stamp counter plugin to help you count votes, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/@daniel">Daniel Destefanis</a> is building a plugin that lets you create stickies from text.</li><li><strong>Task automation:</strong> Make everyday tasks faster and easier. From spell check, to find and replace, to automatically creating 100 pink stickies, plugins can help users complete manual tasks in just a few clicks. We are very excited that <a href="https://www.figma.com/@tkmadeit">Tekeste Kidanu</a> is bringing his popular <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/754026612866636376/SPELLL---Spell-Checking-for-Figma">spell checking</a> plugin to FigJam.</li><li><strong>Content libraries:</strong> Import data from other tools and create objects on your boards. The Figma Community already has several plugins in the works that will give users quick access to icons, emojis, company logos, and more. The team at <a href="https://www.figma.com/@icons8">Icons8</a> will be bringing over their two plugins for <a href="https://www.figma.com/@icons8">Icons8</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/740272380439725040">Material Design</a> icons, <a href="https://www.figma.com/@cyberalien">Vjacheslav Trushkin</a> is bringing over the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/735098390272716381/Iconify">Iconify</a> plugin, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/@amin">Amin Kasimov</a> is bringing over the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733590967040604714">Brandfetch</a> plugin.</li><li><strong>Customization:</strong> Enable users to select custom colors, fonts, or text styles. While we’ve intentionally kept fonts and colors in FigJam simple, we know this is a top user request. The <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/733590967040604714/Brandfetch">Brandfetch</a> plugin offers quick re-theming of FigJam objects into a brand’s colors. And <a href="https://www.figma.com/@jordan">Jordan Singer</a> of <a href="https://tricycle.ai/">Tricycle</a> is working on a FigJam LayerJam plugin, which will provide a layer panel in FigJam.</li><li><strong>Custom templates:</strong> Create custom, browsable template libraries that are specific to your company and brand, and private to your organization or team.</li></ul><p>These are just a handful of examples—we have 35 builders who have FigJam plugins already in the works, and we are so excited for you to join them.</p><p>Plugins are perfect for single-player use cases, since they run individually for each user in a file. If you’re looking to build a more collaborative experience that users can interact with together, you should consider building a widget. You can think of widgets as native FigJam objects—similar to sticky notes, shapes, and connectors—except they’re custom, and built by you.</p><figure><figcaption>An org chart creator in FigJam</figcaption></figure><p>From conversations with users, we know that they’re most excited about the following types of widgets:</p><ul><li><strong>Facilitation:</strong> Make it easier to engage everyone in group settings. Build widgets for voting or polls to make sure everyone’s voice is heard.</li><li><strong>Games and play:</strong> Use cards, dice, spinners, and other games to get everyone energized. Teams are more productive when they’re feeling engaged, creative, and connected.</li><li><strong>Interactive diagrams:</strong> Speed up diagramming by directly clicking on the canvas to add branches to mind maps, org charts, and more.</li><li><strong>Note-taking:</strong> Build notepads that everyone can contribute to so you can more easily capture notes and action items. And power them up with support of Markdown and LaTex rendering.</li><li><strong>Data visualization:</strong> Better visualize the themes from your brainstorms or votes from your workshop with interactive charts and graphs directly on the canvas.</li></ul><p>We have been building widgets internally for the past few weeks and are excited to start opening up the API to the first external builders to see what you come up with. <a href="https://twitter.com/keeyeny">Keeyen Yeo</a>, a product designer at Figma, has been playing around with a photo booth widget, and I’m personally excited to play a game of tic-tac-toe with my team in FigJam.</p><figure><figcaption>Tic-tac-toe in FigJam</figcaption></figure><h2 id="getting-started"><a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a></h2><p>With FigJam, we set out to build a better way to brainstorm with your team, and we can’t wait for the community to build on this foundation.</p><p>You can check out <a href="https://github.com/figma/plugin-samples#figjam-plugins">these examples</a> and start building plugins for FigJam today. Our <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/figma-figjam-plugins/">API documentation</a> also includes information on how you can re-publish any existing Figma plugins to FigJam—for many plugins this should only require a one-line addition to your manifest.</p><p>And if you’re interested in being one of the first to build widgets, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfx40r8fC58dT5G93I_f8fkaaqO_6SQg2oWdFUf4riwqBu3ww/viewform?usp=send_form">let us know here</a>—we’ll reach out as we kick off our beta later this week.</p><p>To learn more about building plugins or widgets, <a href="https://figma.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_zvzM2PpQRKKzm0k6fH8f6g">join our livestream</a> on September 1st at 9am PT and hear from users who have already started building.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>How our product design team uses FigJam</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Last week, we asked our product design team to share how they use <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a>, our online whiteboard, to be more generative as a team and with their cross-functional partners. Check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoCRiAWNEYI">full livestream</a> of our conversation, and read on to learn about how they’ve integrated FigJam into their design process—and even used FigJam to develop features for FigJam itself.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="aa5d18eae3ba" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Until <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figjam/">we launched FigJam</a>, our product design team used Figma for everything—design crits, virtual team hangs, high-fidelity prototypes, and more. While the designers appreciated Figma’s flexibility, other teams sometimes felt intimidated by the more advanced features.</p><p>Since then, we’ve transitioned many of these activities to <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a>, which gives designers a space to collaborate in the earliest stages of the design process, while empowering cross-functional partners to contribute. Below, we’re sharing how our own FigJam workflows have brought our designers, PMs, and engineers closer together, resulting in a more open and inclusive design process.</p><h2 id="narrowing-scope-for-broader-impact"><a href="#narrowing-scope-for-broader-impact">Narrowing scope for broader impact</a></h2><p>We love that Figma allows designers to really dig into the details and iterate quickly. But this aspect can be a bit of a double-edged sword in the earliest stages of the design process, when the focus should be on ideating and brainstorming, rather than creating something pixel-perfect. The beauty of doing earlier work in FigJam is that it reduces that temptation to polish and refine an idea that’s supposed to be illustrative, instead keeping teams focused on the ideas themselves.</p><p>In building FigJam, making the experience fun and delightful was top of mind. To source new ideas, Product Designer <a href="https://twitter.com/jenny_wen">Jenny Wen</a> hosted a workshop that prompted the team to imagine how users might react when we officially announced features like cursor chat, emoji reactions, and stamps. This approach allowed us to work backwards, starting with what users might say in forums and on social media. Ahead of the workshop, she created <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/1009851727123975591">design components</a> resembling tweets and Slack messages.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f8b2199473a1a12e453569d0b8ce10eee5c38537-1582x1163.png?rect=1,0,1581,1163&amp;w=670&amp;h=493&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f8b2199473a1a12e453569d0b8ce10eee5c38537-1582x1163.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f8b2199473a1a12e453569d0b8ce10eee5c38537-1582x1163.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f8b2199473a1a12e453569d0b8ce10eee5c38537-1582x1163.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f8b2199473a1a12e453569d0b8ce10eee5c38537-1582x1163.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f8b2199473a1a12e453569d0b8ce10eee5c38537-1582x1163.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Examples of how the designers thought users would react to new FigJam features on Slack and social media</figcaption></figure><p>From there, all her teammates needed to do was duplicate a component and start filling it out with what they’d ideally like to see in response to the launch. At this stage, Jenny wasn’t looking for specific phrases or images—it was really about getting at a feeling, brainstorming ideas that users would have a positive emotional reaction to. It might seem counterintuitive, but narrowing the scope of the workshop actually helped the team get more ideas down quickly, without getting stuck in the weeds. Once finished, the team could easily find and reference the brainstorm, pull the most popular ideas into a Figma file, and start riffing on designs that eventually resulted in live FigJam features.</p><h2 id="mapping-async-input"><a href="#mapping-async-input">Mapping async input</a></h2><p>When Jenny was working through how to attribute ideas in FigJam, there were a lot of open questions. If we were going to show names on sticky notes in FigJam, we’d still have figure out whether we should allow people to edit their names, how the name might change if someone else changes the sticky, or what happens if a collaborator copies and pastes it. Untangling this specific interaction required input from product managers, engineers, and designers.</p><p>After sharing the first version of sticky note attribution, Jenny used FigJam to visually aggregate feedback that she gathered from early alpha testers and teammates. Once she grouped the input, she built out a decision tree alongside the team’s notes, then shared the file and proposed solution over Slack. This allowed her cross-functional collaborators to asynchronously follow her thinking, share their thoughts, and use stamps to vote for their favorite ideas—all without needing to hop on a call or write up documentation.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3ede086757b886c36faba9a456ca0c0dee9256ab-1600x1056.png?w=670&amp;h=442&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3ede086757b886c36faba9a456ca0c0dee9256ab-1600x1056.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3ede086757b886c36faba9a456ca0c0dee9256ab-1600x1056.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3ede086757b886c36faba9a456ca0c0dee9256ab-1600x1056.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3ede086757b886c36faba9a456ca0c0dee9256ab-1600x1056.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3ede086757b886c36faba9a456ca0c0dee9256ab-1600x1056.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The decision tree that Jenny shared with the team for feedback</figcaption></figure><h2 id="collaborating-and-co-designing"><a href="#collaborating-and-co-designing">Collaborating and co-designing</a></h2><p>For Product Designer <a href="https://twitter.com/keeyeny">Keeyen Yeo</a>, FigJam played a vital role in helping him think visually and tighten up collaboration with his product partners. When he first started working on the FigJam <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500004290981-Stamps-emotes-and-high-fives">high five feature</a>, Keeyen says he was intimidated by the project. Since there wasn’t a relevant example that he could easily pull from, it felt like he was building something from scratch—starting would be the hardest part. So, he leaned on real life experience, using FigJam’s basic shapes and connectors to map out how people actually high-five in person.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9d80b9c0945ff805edb6b0a57f8a94df9a801362-2086x1988.png?rect=1,0,2084,1988&amp;w=670&amp;h=639&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9d80b9c0945ff805edb6b0a57f8a94df9a801362-2086x1988.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9d80b9c0945ff805edb6b0a57f8a94df9a801362-2086x1988.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9d80b9c0945ff805edb6b0a57f8a94df9a801362-2086x1988.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9d80b9c0945ff805edb6b0a57f8a94df9a801362-2086x1988.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9d80b9c0945ff805edb6b0a57f8a94df9a801362-2086x1988.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Keeyen’s FigJam diagram mapping out high fives in real life</figcaption></figure><p>Previously, Keeyen used to sketch out ideas on paper, which made it tough to collaborate with teammates.

      <description>Four Figmates share their advice, learnings, and reflections on joining Figma</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Today, 2022 intern and new grad roles went live on our <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">careers page</a>. We know that deciding how to take the first step in your career can be complicated, so we wanted to share a framework, directly from Figmates in the early stages of their career. Here, intern Beez Africa sits down with interns and new grads to get their advice, learnings, and reflections on joining Figma.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="69bfb3b54836" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Last summer, I had a tough decision to make: go back to school or take a year off to work and wait out the pandemic. At the time, I was a <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-inaugural-student-fellowship/">Fellow</a> working on <a href="https://www.figma.com/education/">Figma for Education</a>, a program that offers free use of Figma for students and educators. Knowing that I must not be the only student grappling with my next step, my team and I published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG">series of conversations</a> exploring how to think about a gap year.</p><p>As I approach my senior year once again, I find myself in a similar position—wondering what I’m going to do after I graduate. Navigating these questions alone is difficult. When it comes to big decisions, my usual approach is to seek outside wisdom. This year, I was lucky to have an awesome community at Figma to draw from. I recently spoke with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/emily-j-a46036134/">Emily Jia</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ldziko/">Langston Dziko</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielavelez/">Daniela Velez</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagopang/">Jago Pang</a>, all of whom are on different teams and at different stages in their career. I definitely found a few gems of advice, and hope you will too.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/908d1baaa763edc79e2852109f60fea506c92cbc-1600x543.png?rect=0,0,1600,542&amp;w=670&amp;h=227&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/908d1baaa763edc79e2852109f60fea506c92cbc-1600x543.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/908d1baaa763edc79e2852109f60fea506c92cbc-1600x543.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/908d1baaa763edc79e2852109f60fea506c92cbc-1600x543.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/908d1baaa763edc79e2852109f60fea506c92cbc-1600x543.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/908d1baaa763edc79e2852109f60fea506c92cbc-1600x543.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><strong>What were you looking for in an internship or new grad role?<br/>Emily:</strong> There’s a lot of variety in data science roles, so I focused on those that fit my skillset and goals well. I have a fairly technical background but I was interested in a fast-paced and product-focused role, so I focused on early-stage data teams at rapidly growing startups. I was also looking for an empathetic culture, which is a personal choice—I’m always thinking about how to connect and communicate with others and want to be surrounded by people who are the same.</p><p><strong>Daniela:</strong> I was searching for authenticity in culture and in people. At Figma, Figmates come to work with an intention to build real community—it’s actually one of our cultural values! I also wanted to work with people who care deeply about Figma&#39;s mission and users. Figmates are all super excited about making design more accessible.</p><p><strong>Langston:</strong> The biggest one for me was career growth. I wanted a good idea of how companies focused on helping engineers progress. How do young engineers feel? Do they have ownership over their project? Are they making an impact on any of the company’s larger goals? I also like to ask engineers if the company is a place they could stay long term, because it hints at whether they feel like that their career is stagnant at this company or if there’s opportunity for career growth.</p><p><strong>Were there any tools or resources that helped you figure out what you wanted in an early career role?</strong><br/><strong>Emily:</strong> I prioritized exploring multiple companies and roles as an undergraduate through summer and off-cycle internships. Conversations with alumni and interviewers during my senior year also brought to light less obvious tradeoffs between early career choices. Beyond hearing about their day-to-day, I found it helpful to hear how they’d grown in the role and think, “do I want this for myself?”</p><p><strong>Langston:</strong> I mainly discovered what I wanted through internships, where you quickly realize what you do and don’t enjoy working on. During the job search process, I tried to speak to as many engineers as I could and ask their advice. A lot of them said the same thing: finding a supportive team and manager who helps you grow is just as important as what you’re working on.</p><p><strong>What drew you to Figma?</strong><br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Prior to interviewing, I came across <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-my-time-as-a-new-grad/">this blog post</a> by Josh Shi, a software engineering new grad on the design systems team. I really appreciated his perspective, and thought it was telling that Figma gave him a platform to share it. Once I started interviewing, I learned that the data team was at an inflection point in terms of growth and influence, making its first new grad hires, and being really thoughtful about team culture. That was (and still is) really exciting to me!</p><p><strong>Langston:</strong> I spoke with quite a few Figma engineers before joining the company. The thing that really stood out to me was their excitement around Figma’s products. It quickly became clear to me that I would get the opportunity to own innovative projects that would help me grow as an engineer, which was ultimately the deciding factor for me.</p><p><strong>Daniela:</strong> I became familiar with Figma while working on a side project—one of my friends uses Figma avidly and she worked on that project with me. I would get so excited to see her designs, jam on potential changes, and add feedback. Not only was I super in love with the product, I also really appreciate Figma&#39;s culture of celebrating individuality and building community.</p><p><strong>Jago:</strong> Figma kickstarted my career in design helped me learn what great design means. I wanted to help contribute to the mission of democratizing design—with programs like <a href="https://www.figma.com/education/">Figma for Education</a>, I knew I could do that on the Figma Community team.</p><p><strong>How did you prepare for interviews at Figma?</strong><br/><strong>Daniela:</strong> I did some interview prep to make sure I was familiar with all the basic data structures and algorithms, and I practiced problems that I generally have a harder time with, like dynamic programming and recursion problems. <a href="https://interviews.school/">Interviews.school</a> was a helpful refresher on general interview topics and LeetCode was helpful as practice. <a href="https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/">Cracking the Coding Interview</a> is also a useful book when I need a refresher about a specific data structure or concept and I want to learn it again from the start!</p><p><strong>Jago:</strong> Knowing that the interview was going to be a portfolio presentation, I created a deck and practiced presenting it several times with friends, family, and other designers. To know what to put in the presentation and how to format it, I attended several workshops with <a href="https://www.designbuddies.community/">Design Buddies</a>, looked at <a href="https://cofolios.com/">Cofolios</a>, and learned from my peers around me. I also used mentoring resources such as <a href="https://www.adplist.org/">ADPlist</a> and LinkedIn for interview tips and wisdom on what hiring managers wanted to see in the case studies.</p><p><strong>Langston:</strong> Interviewing is hard and it’s easy to get stressed! To practice, I’d run through 10-20 practice interviews with a group of friends, switching between asking and answering questions. It’s not as boring as it sounds and you’re able to learn a lot by watching others interview and answer questions yourself. For the behavioral interviews, I would recommend spending some time looking at <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/under-the-hood-of-figmas-infrastructure/">Figma’s engineering blog posts</a>. Reading through them really helped me get a sense of <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-engineering-values/">what Figma values in an engineer</a>.</p><p><strong>What advice would you give others starting out their career as they seek intern and new grad opportunities, both at Figma and elsewhere?</strong><br/><strong>Emily:</strong> Be gentle with yourself. Interviewing is really hard and it’s easy to get wrapped up in needing to land the perfect role right after graduation. In reality, many people I know got experience in a few different roles in those first couple of years. Remember that your worth is not defined by any one job—the version of you with the job is just as worthy as the person you are right now, when you’re still looking for it!</p><p><strong>Langston:</strong> My best advice would be to spend time practicing interview questions. In my experience, interviewing has been a skill that is greatly improved through repetition. I would also suggest listing out what’s important to you in a position, and then make sure you ask your interviewers about those things, which will help with decision-making.</p><p><strong>Daniela:</strong> Rather than building deep knowledge on specific coding languages, I&#39;d suggest gaining breadth by picking up new languages and frameworks. I use personal and team coding projects—even non-technical ones—to build important collaboration skills, like navigating team conflict. And let yourself gravitate towards what you find interesting and fun! If possible, your projects should be a reflection of what excites you and brings you energy.</p><p><strong>Jago:</strong> Never be afraid to ask for help at work. As designers, we tend to only show our best work, but ask early for visual craft questions, ideas and run throughs! Comfort when asking for help will come in handy in <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-critiques-at-figma/">design critiques</a>. You can ask for help before a crit and run through your work with a buddy to make sure you aren’t leaving any gaps, as well as during crit, where other designers can weigh in with ideas and comments.</p><p><strong>What have you been working on since you joined?<br/>Emily:</strong> I spent my first six months on rotation with a few different product teams, running experiments and developing insights to inform product direction, before landing on the Feedback team. Recently, I collaborated with the Growth team to test the hypothesis that providing context about <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a> use cases could add clarity to FigJam users’ experiences. I ran an experiment that displayed FigJam templates alongside a more prominent FigJam entry point in the Figma File Browser, and our new design triggered a significant increase in collaborative FigJam file creation.</p><p><strong>Langston:</strong> My team’s year-long project is to migrate our data to a horizontally sharded model. Horizontally scaling the database is critical to keeping Figma up and running as our user base grows. What’s cool is that, as a new grad, I&#39;ve been able to quickly jump into this project and to contribute to my team&#39;s goals.</p><p><strong>Daniela:</strong> In addition to the other work I’m doing for Figma for Education, I got to improve the account creation process and Figma’s overall signup process with new styled components. Both of these have resulted in better experiences for Figma&#39;s users!</p><p><strong>Jago:</strong> I’m rethinking the publishing flows for resources to the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/explore">Figma Community</a> by making publishing easier and more accessible. Initially, the project was more limited in scope, but I had the opportunity to ask questions that broadened the project&#39;s reach and impact. I also got the chance to edit the project to make it more specific and valuable to Figma’s users. It’s a large-scale but meaningful project, and the whole experience has taught me a lot about taking ownership and running with it.</p><p><strong>How have you grown since coming to Figma?<br/>Jago:</strong> My mentors have enabled me to push my designs further, be confident in my work, and be proactive about what I do in my time here. During mid-point feedback, my mentor encouraged me to be more visible with my work and not to be shy to post more often in Slack channels, ask for help or to jam on something, and send updates on my feature. This changed my perspective on the internship—I was part of more conversations and ended up being more proactive in taking on necessary projects that no one asked me to take. Even the smallest comments on the file let me understand where I could make the most impact!</p><p><strong>Daniela:</strong> I flourished in Figma&#39;s culture of loving your craft. So many Figmates are actually makers themselves in different ways and have the coolest creative side hobbies, from photography to art.</p><p>I also really appreciate my team&#39;s culture of frequent reflection. Every week we go through positive and negative reflections as a team, both about our personal growth and our thoughts on how the team works together. We discuss and create action items at the end. We also use a framework called “deliberate practice,&#34; in which we write short term and long term goals for ourselves and check in on those gradually to make sure we&#39;re growing in the way we want to be growing.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="868e19029181" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em>Special thanks to Beez, Emily, Daniela, Jago, and Langston for sharing their experiences and advice.

      <title>Inside Figma: securing internal web apps</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-securing-internal-web-apps/</link>
      <description>A deep-dive into how we provide access to internal applications</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Over the last few months, the Figma security team has built out a system to securely provide access to internal applications using reusable cloud components and modern security technologies. We think this is a powerful pattern that can help teams across the industry protect their most sensitive internal apps. Here, Security Engineer Max Burkhardt is sharing a look at how we built the system, what we learned, and how this fits into our broader approach to security at Figma.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="f83a136eb9f8" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Figma, like most tech companies, relies on a suite of internally developed applications to make things work behind the scenes. From deploying our software to providing support functionality, the web tools we’ve developed are crucial to employee workflows. They also have stringent security requirements to ensure that only authorized employees can access them.</p><p>Attackers and cybercriminals have a history of going after administrative backends as a way to target user data. To protect our users and their data, we set out to build a system that could provide safe access to internal applications.</p><p>Our approach maximizes off-the-shelf components for easy maintenance and security network effects, but ties them together in novel ways to ensure that we have the best security practices in place. From the start, we had a few requirements:</p><ul><li><strong>Smooth user experience.</strong> Employee productivity is one of our top priorities, so our authentication system must be fast, reliable, and easy to access.</li><li><strong>Zero-trust principles.</strong> Signing in from a “trusted network” isn’t a guarantee of trustworthiness. When authenticating clients, our security model must rely on stronger assertions than network address alone.</li><li><strong>Strong, modern authentication capabilities.</strong> We want to leverage the latest and greatest in web security technologies to protect our internal applications. Any engineer working on an internal app should be able to easily utilize defenses like WebAuthn within the system we build.</li><li><strong>Centralized authorization.</strong> The Figma IT and security teams need to be able to effectively assign, monitor, and adjust permissions granted to employees. A system that is too distributed will quickly become difficult to understand or control, and lead to either over-permissioning or user frustration.</li><li><strong>Minimal toil for the security team.</strong> As a small team with a broad surface to secure, our solution for application access shouldn’t require too much ongoing SRE or operational work.</li></ul><p>In this post, we’ll start with the core technologies and central configurations that provided a solution, and then go into some cool extensions that we built to take advantage of the capabilities of the architecture:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-securing-internal-web-apps/#whats-in-play-technologies-we-used">What’s in play: technologies we used</a></li><li><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-securing-internal-web-apps/#the-basics-aws-application-load-balancers-okta">The basics: AWS Application Load Balancers &amp; Okta</a></li><li><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-securing-internal-web-apps/#getting-specific-using-okta-groups-for-fine">Getting specific: using Okta Groups for Fine-Grained Authorization</a></li><li><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-securing-internal-web-apps/#give-the-engineers-what-they-want-cli">Give the engineers what they want: CLI Authentication</a></li><li><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-securing-internal-web-apps/#share-the-love-enabling-secure-guest-access/"></a><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-securing-internal-web-apps/#share-the-love-enabling-secure-guest-access">Share the love: enabling secure guest access</a></li></ul><h2 id="what-s-in-play-technologies-we-used"><a href="#what-s-in-play-technologies-we-used">What&#39;s in play: technologies we used</a></h2><p>There are a few key pieces of technology that we used in order to create a solution that met all of our requirements. Here is a quick refresher on some things we used to make this work.</p><ul><li><a href="https://auth0.com/blog/how-saml-authentication-works/">SAML</a>: a commonly used protocol for making assertions about a user’s identity across different environments &amp; services, often used in single-sign-on infrastructures. SAML assertions can include statements about a user’s group membership &amp; role as well as their identity.</li><li><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html">AWS Application Load Balancer</a>: a managed reverse-proxy service provided by AWS that can handle HTTP/HTTPS traffic based on a set of rules, and pass it into your infrastructure.</li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/">AWS Cognito</a>: an AWS service that provides user authentication and management APIs, as well as integrations with federated login technologies like SAML.</li><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>: a core part of “serverless computing,” Lambda allows you to deploy code and configure it to run under specific circumstances without worrying about its underlying platform or compute resources.</li><li><a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>: a system for expressing infrastructure configuration as code, so that it can be reviewed, managed, and automated like the rest of your environment. Terraform has a pluggable provider architecture that allows it to configure not only AWS (one of its most common use cases), but also other cloud systems like Okta.</li></ul><h2 id="the-basics-aws-application-load-balancers-okta"><a href="#the-basics-aws-application-load-balancers-okta">The basics: AWS Application Load Balancers &amp; Okta</a></h2><p>At Figma, we use AWS for most of our cloud infrastructure, and we use Okta for our employee authentication and authorization. As a result, our solution focuses on using components provided by those platforms to achieve our goals. AWS Application Load Balancers (ALBs) support authentication of user traffic through a variety of means; often companies configure them with OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication in situations like this. However, Okta charges extra for OIDC support, so we explored other options. You can also configure an ALB to authenticate users with plain SAML, as long as you pair it with an AWS Cognito user pool—this has some other advantages that we’ll get to later.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670&amp;h=355&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bdf8c04df534f69022dbce32294c66f3f14789c-2453x1300.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>To automate the creation of ALB and Cognito resources with the right configuration, our team built Terraform modules in accordance with our infrastructure-as-code philosophy. These modules allow any infrastructure engineer to quickly get an ALB up and running that authenticates users through our Okta deployment. The specific details of the configuration here are too long for this post (<a href="mailto:maxb@figma.com">drop me a line if you’re looking for some code samples</a>!), but here’s the basic configuration:</p><ol><li>We create a Cognito User Pool that disallows user registration. It is connected to a Cognito Identity Provider associated with a SAML Okta application provisioned for this internal app. Notably, we configure the Identity Provider to have mappings for the <code>email</code> and <code>profile</code> attributes, so that these are passed through the SAML assertion into the Cognito identity statement.</li><li>We create a Cognito User Pool Client for the ALB to use, which specifies the ALB’s Oauth2 callback URL, enables the authorization code Oauth2 flow, and specifies which user attributes will be set during login (<code>email</code> and <code>profile</code> are specifically included here, again).</li><li>Finally, we create an ALB object that is configured to authenticate all HTTPS traffic using the User Pool Client created above, before forwarding traffic to the application that we’re trying to expose. All HTTP traffic will be redirected to the HTTPS port.</li></ol><p>Once these pieces are in place, users will automatically be redirected to Okta upon trying to visit the ALB. Assuming that they can successfully authenticate and have been assigned the app in Okta, their request will then be passed on to the internal application. Until their session expires, the user will not see any further authentication prompts.</p><p>This setup has a few key advantages:</p><ul><li>Okta provides advanced authentication features, like <a href="https://webauthn.guide/">WebAuthn</a> and <a href="https://help.okta.com/en/prod/Content/Topics/device-trust/device-trust-landing.htm">Device Trust</a> verification. These are set up in our organization-wide Okta policies and can also be applied to the application as sign-in rules. As a result, we can require that for sensitive applications like our deploy manager, users be on a Figma-managed device and use their phish-proof, hardware MFA tokens.</li><li>ALBs can enable a number of useful security features with just a few clicks (or one <code>terraform apply</code>)—for instance, they <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/08/application-and-classic-load-balancers-adding-defense-in-depth-with-introduction-of-desync-mitigation-mode/">natively support HTTP desync mitigation</a>, can be monitored with an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/waf/">AWS Web Application Firewall</a>, and they’re patched automatically by AWS.</li><li>Because all of the traffic that gets forwarded to our backend has already been parsed and processed by the ALB, the servers that we maintain are shielded against some broad classes of attacks. For example, memory corruption attacks against HTTP or TLS parsing are significantly harder to pull off against our internal servers.</li><li>The ALB supports a customizable session timeout. This allows us to ensure that users have to re-authenticate with a trusted device every x hours, where x can vary based on the sensitivity of the application in question.</li></ul><h2 id="getting-specific-using-okta-groups-for-fine"><a href="#getting-specific-using-okta-groups-for-fine">Getting specific: using Okta groups for fine-grained authorization</a></h2><p>Connecting internal applications to Okta apps via ALBs is a great start along the road to internal user authorization. Using Okta application assignments, we can control which employees can see each application. However, this is a coarse-grained mechanism. We have a number of applications that have broad use cases across the organization, but specific functionality that is best to keep more limited. Take the deployment app, for example: it’s desirable to let any engineer deploy their branch to their personal development environment; only the release manager should be able to deploy to production. Splitting this functionality across two different apps would be challenging from a management and UX perspective, so we built a mechanism to express more Okta authorization context to the underlying application.</p><p>This approach relies on the <code>profile</code> attribute that was mentioned above. With the right combination of configurations, we can send information about which Okta Groups a user belongs to through their SAML assertion, into Cognito, along through the ALB, and finally into the underlying app in the form of a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) in an HTTP header. Here’s how that combination works:</p><ol><li>In the Okta application configuration, we set up a “Group attribute statement” named <code>authorization</code> that specifies a set of Okta groups that should be sent to the underlying app. This specification can be a prefix match or a regex, and allows us to only send groups which might be relevant to the underlying application.</li><li>In the Cognito User Pool, the attribute mappings copy the <code>authorization</code> statement into the <code>profile</code> attribute. Because this attribute is present in the configuration for the Cognito User Pool Client, it will get set when a user logs in through the ALB.</li><li>The <code>profile</code> attribute will then contain the specified groups in the signed <code>x-amzn-oidc-data</code> header when sent to the application backend. <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/listener-authenticate-users.html#user-claims-encoding">Amazon describes how to parse this header here</a>, but note that the approach may need to be tweaked depending on the language you are using and how strict its JWT libraries are.</li></ol><p><br/>If you’re not using Python and are therefore unable to use the sample code provided by Amazon, the following pseudocode describes the operations necessary to safely verify and extract the identity data provided in this JWT. Note that many JWT libraries will fail to validate these tokens because of <a href="https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken/issues/514">this bug in Amazon JWT encoding</a>, so you may need to decode and verify the token separately. This is a security-sensitive operation that is tricky to get right, so test your code thoroughly!</p><ol><li>Split the <code>x-amzn-oidc-data</code> header on the <code>.</code> character, and Base64-decode the first element.</li><li>Parse the decoded element as JSON. Note that you have not verified the JWT yet—we need to decode the JWT header in order to extract the Key ID necessary to fetch the signing public key.</li><li>Extract the <code>kid</code> value from this JSON object, as well as the <code>region</code> value from the <code>signer</code> key.</li><li>Validate that the <code>kid</code> and <code>region</code> values conform to their expected formats (<code>kid</code> should be a UUID, and <code>region</code> should be a valid AWS region).</li><li>Fetch Amazon’s public key at <code>https://public-keys.auth.elb.${region}.amazonaws.com/${kid}</code>. You will likely want to cache this value.</li><li>Now that you have the public key, verify the whole JWT (the value of the <code>x-amzn-oidc-data </code>header), using whatever method your JWT library provides. If verification fails for any reason, throw an authentication error. Make sure that the <code>alg</code> attribute of the JWT is an expected one, and not <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/"><code>none</code></a>!<br/>** <em>JavaScript note: if you are using the </em><code>verify</code><em> method from the </em><code>jws</code><em> library in JavaScript to check the token, it will not perform expiry verification on your behalf; you will need to check the expiry of the token manually (via the </em><code>exp</code><em> field) and ensure it is still valid.</em></li><li>Validate that the <code>iss</code> value in the JWT header is equal to the expected URL of the Cognito User Pool associated with this application. This check ensures that an attacker is not presenting a validly signed JWT that is attached to an unrelated Cognito pool that might be from a different account.</li><li>Return the <code>email</code> and <code>profile</code> fields from the payload of the JWT.</li></ol><p>With this, applications can check a user’s Okta Groups using a helper function written by the Security team and determine what capabilities to grant a user—all while keeping the management of those permissions within Okta, our centralized employee identity provider. The signed header also includes the user’s email, allowing applications to have trustworthy logging about who is performing what actions.</p><p>We went a step further in facilitating this hand-off with some opinionated guidance on how groups should be structured for this use case. It’s tempting to put users in groups based on their team or department in Okta, and then check those in your application code to validate whether an action should be allowed based on a user’s job function. However, this binds application logic to organizational structure, which is likely to change. It also makes it hard to quickly understand what permissions a particular team has been granted. Fortunately, Okta has a feature that allows you to bridge this gap: Group Rules.</p><p>Group Rules allow you to assign a user to a group based on a predicate written in the <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/okta-expression-language/">Okta Expression Language</a>. In our case, this means that we can create many groups—one for each permission—and then use rules to automatically assign those groups to users based on the team listed in their Okta profile. This way, applications can check for a specific group related to the permission, eg. <code>#Deploys dev_environments</code>, instead of checking for a list of team names. This has the added advantage of making it easy to see what permissions a team has: just check the Group Rules in Okta where the team is mentioned, and you’ll see all of the group relationships that that implies.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670&amp;h=92&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/920e781ddf15b8cf9e4d265cdca24ab42f66f7eb-1600x220.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Example Group Rule</figcaption></figure><p>To ensure that these associations are well-tracked and all changes are safely logged, we create them using the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/oktadeveloper/okta/latest">Okta Terraform Provider</a> and check them into our repository along with the rest of our Terraform code.</p><p><em>Note: if an application needs extremely fine-grained permissions, it’s possible that the number of Okta groups sent in the JWT will make the token unreasonably large. If a particular application needs dozens or hundreds of individual permissions, it may be valuable to invest in an independent mapping system between user groups and capabilities.</em></p><h2 id="give-the-engineers-what-they-want-cli"><a href="#give-the-engineers-what-they-want-cli">Give the engineers what they want: CLI authentication</a></h2><p>Secure internal web applications are great, and as a company that builds design software, it’s fun to use Figma to design our own tools. However, some functionality really works best as a command line tool, and in certain cases, it’s the right approach. The <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/under-the-hood-of-figmas-infrastructure/">Figma infrastructure team</a> has built a wide variety of custom CLI (command line interface) tools that often need to make HTTP API calls to get things done. Soon after we set up the ALB-based authentication system described in this post, we wondered: how hard would it be to make API calls against our own internal services from a command line tool?</p><p>At first glance, it’s a challenge: the ALB-to-Okta authentication dance requires multiple redirects and complex browser functionality like WebAuthn. A CLI acting as a browser also wouldn’t be able to reuse the employee’s existing session. To get around these problems, we were inspired by the “browser pop” approach used by the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-sso.html">AWS SSO CLI</a>. By calling a library written by the Figma Security team, an internal CLI tool can trigger the user’s browser to open a page that will confirm the user’s intent to authenticate their terminal and forward the user’s ALB authentication cookie back to the CLI app. Because this is enabled by standard Terraform modules and client libraries, an engineer can enable CLI auth for their internal service with just three lines of code!</p><div><pre><code><span>// In the Terraform configuration for our &#39;gateway_alb&#39; module:
</span>allow_cli_auth = true
// In a Typescript CLI tool:
import { cliAuthenticate } from &#39;../../share/cli-auth&#39;;
const authCookies = await cliAuthenticate(&#39;https://deploys.figma.com&#39;);
</code></pre></div><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?rect=0,0,1600,1067&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5a91ae43d355923c96683f155fdf0cedd554535-1600x1068.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The CLI authentication confirmation screen</figcaption></figure><p>Here is how the magic happens:</p><ol><li>Upon requesting authentication, the CLI uses Mac OS’s <code>open</code> command to open a special route for the requested service in the user’s default browser.</li><li>A high-priority rule configured on the ALB routes that request to a Lambda function (maintained by the Security team). That function presents the confirmation dialog.</li><li>Upon clicking “Authenticate in my terminal,&#34; the Lambda will send the user’s ALB authentication cookies to a webserver that the CLI started on <code>127.0.0.1</code>, allowing the CLI to receive them and attach them to future API calls. This approach avoids the <a href="https://blog.christophetd.fr/phishing-for-aws-credentials-via-aws-sso-device-code-authentication/">phishing risks present in some device code authorization flows</a>.</li><li>The CLI also stores the returned cookies in encrypted storage using the Mac OS keychain, so they never touch the disk in plain text.</li></ol><p>There are a few key security features to ensure a safe flow:</p><ul><li>There’s a random state token that is generated by the CLI, passed through the web interaction, and included in the response to the local webserver. If any requests received by the local webserver lack the correct state token, they are immediately rejected.</li><li>The CLI ensures that the webserver can correctly bind to the designated port before opening the webpage. This ensures that it gets the cookie, not some other local service that was able to bind the port first.</li><li>The confirmation page is displayed with a very strict Content Security Policy that helps provide an additional layer of defense against web application attacks.</li></ul><p>Thanks to this feature, our local CLI tools can do things like check deployment state or look up internal information with minimal code changes and a few clicks from the user.</p><p>The fact that we are using Cognito User Pools to gate access to our internal ALBs has another advantage: User Pools don’t have to be limited to just SAML users. We’ve run into a few cases where we’d like to expose an internal application to a trusted guest; for instance, when giving access to a private beta. Because our ALB authentication is backed by the full capabilities of Cognito, we can make a new user account that’s unassociated with our Okta environment in the User Pool. Then, we can pass the credentials over to the partner and let them log in without having to provision them a Figma employee account.</p><p>Enabling this is as simple as specifying the <code>COGNITO</code> identity provider alongside your Okta one in the User Pool Client configuration for your ALB. As soon as you do this, the login page will switch to one that allows either Okta/SAML login or Cognito-based username &amp; password login. Notably, this only works if a User Pool is very explicitly configured in this way—we leave this out of the defaults, so most internal apps will only support Okta logins.</p><h2 id="bringing-it-all-together"><a href="#bringing-it-all-together">Bringing it all together</a></h2><p>Using the infrastructure components described above, we built a modern, highly secure application gateway product for internal use that doesn’t demand extensive, ongoing maintenance from the team—in fact, the security team doesn’t even have to operate any servers in this setup. Instead, they just act as code owners for the Terraform configurations and the CLI authentication Lambda &amp; associated libraries.</p><p>This project has leveled up our infrastructure defenses and inspired a number of new projects for the coming months. The team is working to apply similar methodologies to all of our application and infrastructure defenses—from detecting attacks in our corporate network, to identifying authorization vulnerabilities automatically in our primary web application. As we continue to innovate and experiment in this arena, we’ll share what we can with the community.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="05a4c7b32548" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We are a small team, passionate about modernizing security practices and contributing to the broader community.

      <title>A Q&amp;A with Figma’s VP of Product</title>

      <description>The road to building FigJam, and how things continue to change across design and product development</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Since we launched <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a> back <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figjam/">in April</a>, teams having been using it to grow all kinds of ideas into great designs. We recently caught up with Figma&#39;s VP of Product, <a href="https://twitter.com/yuhkiyam">Yuhki Yamashita</a>, to hear what it was like to build FigJam and how things have changed since then. Here, he reflects on the evolving role of design and product management, what it means to welcome “non-designers” into the process, and the future of FigJam.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="9ac1218c5475" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><strong>Tell me a little bit about what you do at Figma.</strong><br/>I lead the product team here at Figma, which includes design, product management, and product research. We’re responsible for talking to our users, figuring out which problems to solve, and working with everyone in the company to generate and build the best solutions.</p><p><strong>Take us back to when Figma first launched FigJam. Why did the team build an online whiteboarding tool?</strong><br/>When we’re thinking about where to take our product next, we actually take a lot of inspiration from our customers and the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/explore">Figma Community</a>, to see how they’re stretching our product in interesting or unexpected ways. We saw this happening in the early days of the pandemic. Our users were starting to use Figma for everything from brainstorming ideas to running team warm-up activities, to even putting on social events for people to get to know each other. We saw a lot of use cases that got us thinking.</p><p>Of course, we were also transitioning to remote work ourselves and figuring out how to bring offline processes to an online format. There was something about just being in one (virtual) space together that felt like it was really hitting on some deep need that we all had. It validated what we had already observed from our users—that it was important to bring that experience into Figma.</p><p><strong>A big driver behind building FigJam was to help designers work with their extended teams. How have you seen design behavior change since you’ve been at Figma?</strong><br/>Design is opening up. Within design teams, people are riffing with each other more. And outside of design, more people across teams are jamming together, too. Whether it’s small copy tweaks or more fundamental changes, we’re seeing Figma and FigJam links being passed around the organization much earlier in the development process.</p><p>I think this speaks to a larger trend: that the boundary between engineering, design, and product management is blurring. Some of us used to have a mental model in which roles and responsibilities dictated how things work—that designers do one thing and engineers do another, for example. Increasingly, more people are crossing team lines to problem solve together. It has been validating to hear from our users (and Figmates!) that Figma encourages and facilitates that change in a way that makes everyone feel welcome.</p><p><strong>And how has the role of the PM changed?</strong><br/>I think the PM and design roles have always had some overlap, but they didn’t always have the tools they needed to explore and collaborate together. I have worked on both design and product teams, so I’ve felt this firsthand. There used to be a sense that designs were sacred—it was kind of offensive when a PM came in and made a change or edited something, because it was the designer’s file. Now, it’s not about who “owns” what—it’s more of a collective endeavor. And the roles have become more interlocked, and I think that’s fundamentally a good thing.</p><p><strong>As you think about pushing the design process forward, what’s top of mind?</strong><br/>Design is non-linear. At Figma, we often talk about “embracing the mess,” and that really means leaning into the chaos and complexity that makes the design process what it is. Even once you have the seedling of an idea, you need to explore and iterate, then pull back and evaluate to see what’s working and what’s not. Sometimes you’ll scrap an idea after a brainstorm session, and other times you’ll get pretty far with a concept, but still need different perspectives and input to move forward.</p><p>It’s important to have spaces that allow you to engage with the work from different altitudes—to both dive in and zoom out, at every part of the design process. With Figma and FigJam, we’re starting to see a lot more fluidity end to end, whether that’s in ideation and brainstorming, or design and development.</p><p><strong>When would someone choose to use FigJam over Figma?</strong><br/>FigJam is a great choice when things are a little more nebulous. Maybe you just want to throw around ideas, or get a temperature check for how people are feeling. You can do a lot of the generative brainstorming and mapping in FigJam, while Figma helps you start building towards an interface.</p><p><strong>What’s your favorite feature, and how has it changed the way you work?</strong><br/>I love the expressiveness of FigJam. Previously, when I ran meetings, I’d circulate a shared doc and ask the team for agenda items. It felt polished and linear in a way that put the focus on project updates and milestones, instead of problem solving and unblocking together. With FigJam, it’s less about “meeting notes” and more about just being in the same space, together.</p><p>I also think that video conferencing creates frustrating dynamics—when you unmute, it feels like you need to declare that you have something to say. In FigJam, the cursor chats, emojis, and stickers are all ways that people can express themselves more naturally. The ephemeral nature of all of this is also very important—people just want to emulate a smile or a laugh without feeling like they need to leave a permanent imprint. There are so many human aspects of FigJam that I really like. More than anything, it can change the tone of the meeting, and generally how we work together. I think that’s really meaningful.</p><p><strong>What’s next?</strong><br/>People are using FigJam for all kinds of workshops and exercises, and there’s certainly more we can do to help people facilitate those activities better. For example, <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1403021292463214595?s=20">the timer</a>, which we recently launched, is a huge part of running a workshop. Moving forward, we’re asking ourselves how we can be there to make these activities as effective as possible.</p><p>As ever, we want to lean even more into the Figma Community. Just as the community guided us to build FigJam, we’re excited to see the ways they continue to use FigJam. Whether they have ideas on how to run a great brainstorm, retrospective, or crit, or they’ve found a new way to use FigJam, I personally can’t wait to see what they come up with. And whatever that looks like, we want to make sure those resources are as easy to access as possible.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="7c909887f06a" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">Learn more about FigJam</a> and check out <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/figjam">templates from the Figma Community</a> to get started.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>A compilation of recent improvements that enhance your workflow in Figma</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Last month, we launched 30 updates on everything from typography fixes to UX improvements, all to enhance your workflow in Figma. See the full list of changes <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/987131792901181457">in this file</a> on the Figma Community and follow <a href="https://www.figma.com/whats-new/">what’s new in Figma</a> for weekly improvements and fixes.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="b342037da643" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We know for designers working in Figma, every click makes a difference. And sometimes small changes can have a big impact on creative flow. Here, we’re sharing a roundup of updates and fixes we recently made to reduce the distance between idea and design.</p><p>1. First up: a redesigned stroke panel for easier customization of vector objects. Now you can adjust end caps to easily create arrows and fine-tune the stroke properties of connectors copied and pasted from FigJam.</p><figure></figure><p>2. Bigger? Smaller? Left? Right? You can now use math operations to adjust properties with a mixed value.</p><figure></figure><p>3. Copy as PNG is now available in the browser (it was previously only available in the desktop app). 🎉 Use keyboard shortcut <code>⌘+Shift+C</code>/<code>Ctrl+Shift+C</code> to do this quickly!</p><figure></figure><p>4. Speaking of keyboard shortcuts: you can now hold <code>⌘</code>/<code>Ctrl</code> while resizing an image to crop it immediately from wherever you are.</p><figure></figure><p>5. We have also made some improvements to text exporting, adding an “include bounding box” export setting in the Editor, and corresponding <code>use_absolute_bounds</code> setting in the Plugin API. Also, “Contents only” export is now called “Ignore overlapping layers.”</p><figure></figure><p>6. Let’s talk about the pencil tool. You can now select stroke properties before using the pencil tool, so drawing in Figma feels more like putting pen to paper—and doing it after will be remembered.</p><p>6 ½. On a related note, pen tool also remembers its stroke settings for the future.</p><p>7. We’ve redesigned the cursor hand to be less intrusive, and more delightful. Give it a try!</p><p>8. Different tabs, same settings. Preferences are now automatically synced across all tabs you have opened—no need to reload.</p><p>9. A second fill added to an object is now a solid fill color, rather than a gradient, making it easier to adjust.</p><p>10. Adjusting images now takes one less click. No need to click on adjustment sliders to start using them—just slide away.</p><p>11. You can now close the “Move to project” dialog box quickly by clicking outside of it or pressing Esc.</p><p>12. Copying and pasting text with a missing font now activates the global A? missing font icon.</p><p>13. Now when you copy stickies from FigJam to other places as text, the text copied is sorted to match the layout in FigJam.</p><p>14. No more searching for missing fonts. With the redesigned missing font dialog, just click to see the affected layers.</p><p>15. We increased the hit target size for the top menu entry point, making the chevron much easier to click.</p><p>16. If you use a mouse with a middle button, you’re in luck! You can now open selected links using middle-click.</p><p>17. Speaking of buttons: our repositioning buttons (like Align To Top) are now active even when you edit text.</p><p>18. Let’s talk about links. You can now pan over them without being interrupted when you encounter link pop-ups.</p><p>19. We’ve also adjusted the size of the selected text background when renaming a file. No more tall, blue rectangle—it’s back to expected height.</p><p>20. Figma no longer ignores when you paste an image while text editing. Now, it exits text editing and pastes it, so you can move faster.</p><p>21. Icons in Figma’s layers panel will now update faster to reflect the objects they represent (organized layers for the win!).</p><p>22. We removed the “+” option for text nodes with mixed styles, allowing you to override them with a new style or color easily.</p><p>23. We’ve made things less confusing when using “Z” to zoom by no longer showing the selection rectangle to other people in the file.</p><p>24. ATTN Safari users: scrubbing fields by holding <code>⌥</code> and moving your mouse now works in the browser.</p><p>25. There is now a hover state for frame presets, making it obvious these are clickable.</p><p>26. We fixed how drag handles display on grid property rows.</p><p>27. For those moments when you want the right click menu to stick around: it now doesn’t dismiss quite so eagerly on Safari.</p><p>28. When you create a new ruler, it will now be automatically selected, so you can nudge it with your keyboard—or delete it if you change your mind.</p><p>29. We resolved an issue with opening the toolbar dropdown in View Only mode.</p><p>30. Last (but not least), we’ve made the layers panel scroll to find the selected layer when using selection keyboard shortcuts.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="0ab9977c3a34" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We always aim to improve Figma to better meet your needs.

      <title>How the Figma PM team builds products and processes</title>

      <description>A look at their daily habits and weekly syncs</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Hq9u-IjET8">a recent livestream</a>, Figma’s PM team gave us a peek into their team norms. Here, we&#39;re sharing how their culture of transparency and trust comes to life in their daily habits and weekly syncs, and what it means to open up their processes to cross-functional partners.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="5cdc408aa0a0" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Product management can be confusing from the outside. It seems that people are always asking what exactly a PM does, and for good reason: answers differ from company to company, where responsibilities and processes around product management vary widely. But one constant is that PMs sit at the center of product development, so the bulk of their work requires interfacing with various teams. Building fluency across these functions also requires knowing how to bring cross-functional partners into their work. At Figma, the PM experience is distinguished by a culture of trust, reflection, inclusion, and transparency—four things that help our PM team drive product development at Figma with an eye towards opening up their processes.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?rect=0,0,2315,784&amp;w=670&amp;h=227&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4b31758c4402fab9b2105dc8529bf61a305d2d91-2315x786.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="opening-up-to-ideas"><a href="#opening-up-to-ideas">Opening up to ideas</a></h2><p>At Figma, we do a lot of <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-five-stages-of-an-effective-brainstorm/">cross-functional brainstorms</a>. Great ideas rely on input from all directions, traversing teams, and pinging across desks (or laptops) before reaching their final form. But brainstorms just amount to frustration when you don’t have clear decisions or action items, and it can be tough to mobilize after ideating. Here are some of Product Manager <a href="https://twitter.com/kelseymwhelan">Kelsey Whelan</a>’s favorite exercises to help draw out team alignment on product direction.</p><h3 id="buy-a-feature"><a href="#buy-a-feature">“Buy a Feature”</a></h3><p>Prioritization is a core part of a product manager’s job, especially with input flying in from all directions. As a PM, you get a ton of feedback from users and teams across Figma, and the tough part is figuring out what to green-light (and all the great ideas to say no to). <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/991728859371527440">Buy a Feature</a> is an exercise that the Figma PM team uses to map prioritization to time and resources. Everyone starts the exercise with a certain amount of currency (Kelsey makes bills that feature her team members), then the PM sets an amount of time for everyone to “invest” in different product ideas or focus areas. “It gives you a sense of how much people would invest in an area, not just a stack-rank list,” Kelsey explains.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34fdd34f2a921dce580f0df21b14ae5d8d985a64-1596x1283.png?rect=1,0,1595,1283&amp;w=670&amp;h=539&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34fdd34f2a921dce580f0df21b14ae5d8d985a64-1596x1283.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34fdd34f2a921dce580f0df21b14ae5d8d985a64-1596x1283.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34fdd34f2a921dce580f0df21b14ae5d8d985a64-1596x1283.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34fdd34f2a921dce580f0df21b14ae5d8d985a64-1596x1283.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34fdd34f2a921dce580f0df21b14ae5d8d985a64-1596x1283.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>An example of how the Figma intern class (Figterns) uses the Buy a Feature template</figcaption></figure><h3 id="alignment-scale"><a href="#alignment-scale">Alignment scale</a></h3><p>Our PM team also uses <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/991728669310555407">alignment scales</a> to tease out their convictions about product decisions. To start, the team comes up with a direction or a list of statements and beliefs to guide the work.

We have mentioned <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-how-our-pm-team-uses-figjam/">stand-ups</a> before—our product teams use them to stay updated on what’s getting done, what still needs work, and who needs a helping hand. But at weekly stand-ups among PMs, Product Manager <a href="https://twitter.com/brsabel">Bersabel Tadesse</a> opens the floor up to more than status updates. The weekly stand-up is a place to catch up on what’s happening personally, at home, in life, and in people’s minds.</p><p>VP of Product <a href="https://twitter.com/yuhkiyam?lang=en">Yuhki Yamashita</a> headlines the weekly agenda with updates from the executive team. After some ad hoc contributions from PMs, each PM answers the following prompts in FigJam:</p><ol><li><strong>Personal update.</strong> What’s something you’ve been thinking about in your personal life?</li><li><strong>Worried or excited about.</strong> Work-related or not, what are you concerned about or unsure of?</li><li><strong>Hard problems.</strong> What hard or interesting problem have you been noodling on?</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97d9e23f777a2d9277f4a83da6a9ba4df376d6e7-1600x787.png?rect=1,0,1598,787&amp;w=670&amp;h=330&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97d9e23f777a2d9277f4a83da6a9ba4df376d6e7-1600x787.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97d9e23f777a2d9277f4a83da6a9ba4df376d6e7-1600x787.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97d9e23f777a2d9277f4a83da6a9ba4df376d6e7-1600x787.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97d9e23f777a2d9277f4a83da6a9ba4df376d6e7-1600x787.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97d9e23f777a2d9277f4a83da6a9ba4df376d6e7-1600x787.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>FigJam has built-in dot stamps that teams can use for dot voting</figcaption></figure><p>The PMs use dot voting, stickers, or reactions to vote on challenges they deem particularly important to solve or worth exploring in future meetings. “These prompts provide a low stakes way to share hard problems early on, which encourages more collaboration throughout the product development process,” says Bersabel. While the exercise helps with visibility and prioritization, these prompts give everyone a chance to provide deeper insights on the work they all do—a precious opportunity when you’re the only PM on your team, which is usually the case.</p><p>Especially with everyone being remote, the extra layer of personal context has helped build trust and culture among PMs who felt isolated. At a glance, vulnerability may not seem like a major priority for a high-level meeting among all of Figma’s PMs, but it’s the foundation of the meeting. When the team knows what someone’s dealing with at home, or whether a PM is particularly concerned about an aspect of a feature, they get a chance to address tough challenges head-on, lend a hand, or prevent those concerns from becoming blockers. And during a year out of office, the team wanted to devote time to this type of sharing to make up for chance office conversations, where these things come up naturally.</p><h2 id="reflecting-together"><a href="#reflecting-together">Reflecting together</a></h2><p>Retrospectives, or <em>retros</em>, are an intentional way to reflect back on a project or a period of time. Retros are an integral part of the product development process, and thinking critically about what went well and what could improve is a core skill for any PM. Our PM team makes this level of reflection a top priority.</p><p>“It’s really healthy to reflect at a cadence,” says Yuhki. Although the common pattern is to retro every shipped product, the team has found stability in having retros at regular intervals, no matter where projects fall at the time. “I had my own experience with this—I felt really overwhelmed with all that was coming next, and I didn’t really promote a culture of reflection on my own PM team. But when Bersabel joined, she actually helped us institute a process of reflecting every six weeks as a PM team,” he says.</p><p>A valuable retro goes well beyond recording what went well and what didn’t. It opens up room for people to give praise and get recognition, but it also explicitly invites thorough feedback. “[Retros] are a good forcing function for recognizing good work and airing out frustrations. We don’t want to make people go out of their way to express these opinions,” explains Yuhki. “People often have these loose, un-formed opinions and ideas, and don’t have the place to share them.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7704fddce59b71b6f734015a28302e06af865fbb-1600x919.png?rect=0,0,1599,919&amp;w=670&amp;h=385&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7704fddce59b71b6f734015a28302e06af865fbb-1600x919.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7704fddce59b71b6f734015a28302e06af865fbb-1600x919.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7704fddce59b71b6f734015a28302e06af865fbb-1600x919.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7704fddce59b71b6f734015a28302e06af865fbb-1600x919.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7704fddce59b71b6f734015a28302e06af865fbb-1600x919.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A snapshot of Yuhki explaining the “start, stop, continue” framework during the livestream</figcaption></figure><p>“Retros are really important if you work in a fast-paced environment like Figma because it can be tempting to just move onto that next thing…,” says Yuhki. “That next thing is waiting for you without even time to reflect. Processes change, companies change, and it’s really healthy to promote a culture of reflection among PMs,” he adds. While there are several templates for retros (the classic is <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/844265697668900221"><em>start, stop, continue</em></a>), Yuhki shares three important conditions for what makes a good retro at Figma:</p><ol><li>Everyone’s voice is heard.</li><li>The reflection is deep enough to extract meaningful insights.</li><li>Action items are taken.</li></ol><h3 id="asking-the-right-questions"><a href="#asking-the-right-questions">Asking the right questions</a></h3><p>Retros are ultimately about zooming out meaningfully, but sometimes asking, “What can we start, stop, continue doing can feel a bit generic,” says Yuhki. “It might not help trigger the right reflections. So, choosing some targeted questions helps to create some ‘lenses’ for reflection.” Below are some questions for focused team reflection:</p><ul><li>Do we feel that we’re building the right things?</li><li>Are we doing this in the best way possible?</li><li>How effectively &amp; efficiently are we making decisions?</li><li>How well are we working with other functions?</li><li>How strong has our PM culture been?</li></ul><p>“Processes have to change, companies grow a lot, and what worked a year ago may no longer be working,” says Yuhki. Above all, it’s about finding what works well for the team, and constantly improving along the way.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="852eb7d61bc9" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>To try some of these processes with your team, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-how-our-pm-team-uses-figjam/">check out the templates</a> that our PM team uses for brainstorms and retrospectives.

And by being thoughtful partners for the teams using our products everyday, that value of Figma organically reaches key decision-makers.”</p><p>We sat down with some of the team to chat about how sales at Figma works, what they’ve learned, and what they’re excited about for the future.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f306af2ec2a14913f728a5d4ba0520c4c5ebe9-3200x1660.jpg?rect=2,0,3196,1660&amp;w=670&amp;h=348&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f306af2ec2a14913f728a5d4ba0520c4c5ebe9-3200x1660.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f306af2ec2a14913f728a5d4ba0520c4c5ebe9-3200x1660.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f306af2ec2a14913f728a5d4ba0520c4c5ebe9-3200x1660.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f306af2ec2a14913f728a5d4ba0520c4c5ebe9-3200x1660.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f306af2ec2a14913f728a5d4ba0520c4c5ebe9-3200x1660.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><strong>What makes selling Figma unique to other products or services you’ve sold?</strong><br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaroncramer/"><strong>Aaron</strong></a>: “At Figma, we are often lucky enough to work with an internal champion who believes deeply in the value of our platform. They become advocates instead of users, and we become partners instead of vendors. It&#39;s really unique to feel like you are on the same side of the table and working towards a common goal.”</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/radhikaparashar/"><strong>Radhika</strong></a>: &#34;We get to sell to really interesting personas. Designers are so kind, intentional, and thoughtful—and they’re typically able to communicate their needs really well. But we don&#39;t just sell to designers! There are so many other people that are part of the decision-making process: hybrid and supporting roles that contribute in so many ways to product design and development.”</p><p><strong>What was most helpful in learning the design landscape?</strong><br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrealowitz/"><strong>Andrea</strong></a>: &#34;I had no design experience or background before joining Figma, but the sales team and designer advocates were so helpful in getting me up to speed and helping me learn the ins and outs of Figma, designer pain points, and more. I learned so much during the five-week onboarding process and am continuing to learn every day.&#34;</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kparrish8/"><strong>Kyle</strong></a>: &#34;Dylan, our CEO, suggested that I spend my first four weeks at Figma shadowing the support team. That was instrumental in helping me understand our users’ biggest challenges and asks, learn the product in detail, and in building key cross-functional relationships with other teams at Figma.&#34;</p><p><strong>What influenced you to join Figma?</strong><br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tahirih-skolnik-2a135b103/"><strong>Tahirih</strong></a>: “The idea of product-led growth was intriguing to me in a SaaS setting. Because many of our target customers are already Figma users, we’re able to avoid traditional sales tactics and instead be true partners for them. It’s much more interesting than going through the motions of a typical SaaS sales cycle.”</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simon-cox/"><strong>Simon</strong></a>: “I’d had experience working with designers in a previous role and I was intrigued by the way they talked about Figma. There was this affinity for the products and brand that felt unique and special. Once I started interviewing, it was clear that Figma would take me on a journey of growth—the decision was easy.”</p><p><strong>How would you describe Figma’s Sales culture?</strong><br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wesleyclinton/"><strong>Wes</strong></a>: “Figma&#39;s sales culture is unlike any other I&#39;ve been a part of. The general approach is very supportive—much more consultative than competitive. Sales is often an individual sport, but at Figma, work is always recognized and celebrated across the entire team.”</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrealowitz/"><strong>Andrea</strong></a>: “Culture was a huge part of my decision to join Figma. The culture is incredibly collaborative—the motto on the sales team is <em>people over pipeline</em>. Figma is a place where people genuinely care about your personal development and career progression.“</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/radhikaparashar/"><strong>Radhika</strong></a>: “Figma’s sales culture is super unique and so product-driven, which means that everything we do is cross-functional. Sales and product worked so closely together in the early days and those relationship investments pay dividends now. It&#39;s a really collaborative, low-ego, inclusive environment filled with very thoughtful and intelligent people.”</p><p><strong>How would you describe the opportunities for career growth and personal development within the sales organization at Figma?</strong><br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaroncramer/"><strong>Aaron</strong></a>: “I left a well-established company to join Figma in the beginning of 2019. Being part of an early team that was scrappy and had to figure it all out was really exciting to me (and a little bit scary!). Back then, we had few answers to most of the questions sales candidates ask during interviews—our average sales cycle, deal size, legal process, etc. We’ve grown a lot since then, but I think my willingness to take risks and help build something from the ground up afforded me ample opportunities throughout my time here. Making life changes—whether starting a new role or navigating a cross-country move—isn’t always easy, but I’ve felt very lucky to have had three empathetic managers who continue to support me and share lessons in how to be a great teammate, partner, and salesperson.”</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tahirih-skolnik-2a135b103/"><strong>Tahirih</strong></a>: “At Figma, I’ve always felt supported in discussing my career aspirations and building plans to achieve those goals with my managers and other leaders on the team. As a result, I’ve held three different roles on the sales team and seen amazing progression in a short period of time. While that is success in the most literal way, I find the opportunities for growth to be available in non-traditional settings as well. Salespeople at Figma are encouraged to collaborate with cross-functional partners in ways I was never empowered or encouraged to at previous companies. Accessibility to senior leadership and other functions has allowed me to uncover career interests and passions I never knew I had, which have been invaluable for my growth. The options are uniquely ubiquitous!”</p><p><strong>What are you most excited about for the future of Figma?</strong><br/><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/pierreberlin/"><strong>Pierre</strong></a>: “EMEA is such an opportunity for us in terms of the users already in the region and the industries they represent. I’m particularly excited for continued expansion to be even closer to these users and better serve them. With our vision to make design accessible to all, I can envision a future where Figma has hundreds of employees in Europe, helping to transform the design process for most companies in the region.”</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/erin-rudwall-87a59716/"><strong>Erin</strong></a>: “I’m eager to see how our users expand their usage of Figma in unique ways. I&#39;m always amazed at the interesting use cases of visual collaboration that take place on the platform. In the coming years, it’s clear that design will be a company-wide discipline and design thinking will help companies win. Figma has a real opportunity to play a part in that.”</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="a831e90b28b8" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>The sales team is growing quickly with open roles in San Francisco, New York City, London, and remote in the US.

We are always interested in the ways teams use Figma to do just that—brainstorm, ideate, team-build—and it’s one of the many reasons <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figjam/">we launched FigJam</a>.

Though we’ve all been suffering in our own ways, some of us, like me, have been luckier and less affected than others. I’ve had the good fortune and privilege of being able to keep my job as an illustrator at Shopify, and continue working remotely. I’m grateful for that every day.</p><p>Through the pandemic, the rest of Shopify’s illustrators and I have been developing and launching a completely <a href="https://ux.shopify.com/redesigning-the-illustration-style-at-shopify-a94dc893cd77?gi=a8970ef60c7b">redesigned illustration style for Shopify’s product</a>, and a bunch of other things. It has required a heck of a lot of creative energy during a time when energy is harder to come by. With so much disturbance happening both in our global community, and in our personal lives, how are we supposed to still be as creative and productive as ever?</p><p>I definitely don’t have all the answers, and different people are going to have different strategies. But here are a few things I’ve found to be helpful for me and my peers to keep that creativity and productivity flowing.</p><h2 id="have-some-fun"><a href="#have-some-fun">Have some fun</a></h2><p><a href="https://www.shopify.ca/about">Making commerce better</a> for everyone is a tall task. There are over a million business owners relying on us to design solutions to the problems that may deeply impact their lives. Big business is serious business.</p><p>Despite how seriously I take my work and responsibilities, having a little fun every once in a while has been an essential part of keeping me happy, engaged, and creative.</p><h3 id="highly-effective-hijinks"><a href="#highly-effective-hijinks">Highly effective hijinks</a></h3><p>Figma has been a great way to let loose a little. We spend so much of our time in it, exploring designs, polishing final assets, building flows. To many of us, it’s a tool for doing serious design work.</p><p>But you know what else Figma is great for?

Maybe momentarily disrupting the monotony of the serious design process is the kickstart your project needs to make that next creative breakthrough.</p><div><blockquote><p>The real-time collaborative environment that Figma offers is a fantastic tool for lighthearted deviancy.</p></blockquote></div><h3 id="step-away-from-the-work"><a href="#step-away-from-the-work">Step away from the work</a></h3><p>Taking time as a team to step away from the work and build connections with each other through something fun and creative isn’t revolutionary stuff. Visions of beige boardrooms, quick-erase markers and paper cups of tepid, watered-down Kool-Aid might come to mind when you hear “team building activity.” But it’s easy to forget just how beneficial that time can be.</p><p>What makes a good team activity, for me, is something that’s:</p><ul><li><strong>Fast and easy.</strong> Less than an hour at most. People have stuff to do.</li><li><strong>Without serious goals or outcomes.</strong> I’ve got enough of that already, thank you.</li><li><strong>Optional, and casual.</strong> If someone doesn’t want to join, you have to accept that. If somebody just wants to watch, or has to leave early, great! They’re honoring their boundaries. Respect.</li><li><strong>Consensual. </strong>Tell your team that you’ve got an idea to do something fun together. Ask them if that’s of interest to them. Make it clear that it’s optional.</li><li><strong>Inclusive.</strong> Everyone on the team is invited. Work together as a group to find what works for everyone who wants to join. Consider the accessibility challenges for different people and ensure everyone has equal opportunity to participate.</li></ul><p>For example, we’ve done a biweekly asynchronous, Creative Brain Time drop-in activity where we’re given a creative design prompt, and we set aside a small amount of time to do it on a Friday afternoon. Or a little while ago, my team and I played a game where we used <a href="https://www.kastapp.co/">KastApp</a> to stream an episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BobRossInc">Bob Ross’ Joy of Painting</a> together, and followed along with an online <a href="https://canvaspaint.org/#local:f25096f97d8ab">MS Paint simulator</a>. It was a hoot. Maybe <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a> next time?</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/84615932ad5e4c3f650f64bcd27cc06df1593e8d-1600x954.png?rect=0,0,1600,953&amp;w=670&amp;h=399&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/84615932ad5e4c3f650f64bcd27cc06df1593e8d-1600x954.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/84615932ad5e4c3f650f64bcd27cc06df1593e8d-1600x954.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/84615932ad5e4c3f650f64bcd27cc06df1593e8d-1600x954.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/84615932ad5e4c3f650f64bcd27cc06df1593e8d-1600x954.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/84615932ad5e4c3f650f64bcd27cc06df1593e8d-1600x954.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Behold, my life’s work</figcaption></figure><h2 id="talk-as-people"><a href="#talk-as-people">Talk as people</a></h2><p>Intentionally making the time and space for human connection is more important than ever. Without it, our connection with each other becomes limited to meetings with a specific business purpose or time-boxed outcome.</p><p>Personally, I’m here to do my job well, and I need some level of genuine, human, not-about-work connection from 9-5. These things can coexist, and even support each other.</p><h3 id="have-jam-sessions"><a href="#have-jam-sessions">Have jam sessions</a></h3><p>Jumping into an unplanned multiplayer jam session in Figma has been a great way for us to both connect with someone in a conversational way, and get the work done.</p><p>We might be working on the same thing together, simultaneously. Or we could be working on our own individual projects and having a chat at the same time, just as a bunch of folks sitting beside each other in a physical office space might.</p><p>There is no right or wrong here—it’s about what works best for you, your boundaries, your work, and energy levels. It doesn’t even need to be a video chat, it could be audio only. Or you could talk with written comments. Or heck don’t talk at all and just have a cursor buddy floating around the same space as you. The point is to know what you need to feel well, and make the space for it in your workflow.</p><h3 id="plan-casual-meetings"><a href="#plan-casual-meetings">Plan casual meetings</a></h3><p>I can often experience some feelings of shame or guilt associated with spending company time on something that doesn’t have deliverables. But booking in an hour every Friday to gather as a team, catch up, share a refreshing beverage, and do some weekly rituals isn’t a corporate cardinal sin—it&#39;s an important part of building a healthy, connected group of people.</p><p>Especially nowadays, with many of us in distributed digital workplaces where “water cooler talk” in the break room doesn’t just happen anymore, intentionally making the space for small talk is all the more important. These are the spaces where we can connect on the common plane of day to day existence (and what we watched on Netflix last night).</p><h2 id="embrace-the-mess"><a href="#embrace-the-mess">Embrace the mess</a></h2><p>Sitting at my frosted aluminum-bodied laptop, trying to build beautiful and functional digital experiences, sometimes it can start to feel like I, too, must be as polished and organized as the things I make. Or that the quality of the things I make reflects on my own value as a person.</p><p>I so often forget that I’m basically just a fleshy tube a few short rungs up the evolutionary chain from the mighty sea cucumber.</p><h3 id="show-the-rough-stuff"><a href="#show-the-rough-stuff">Show the rough stuff</a></h3><p>Embracing the rough work—and getting feedback on my work earlier in the process—frees me from the burden of impossible standards I set for myself. It leaves me with more energy to dedicate to feeling good, and doing good work.</p><p>In practice, this involves not spending time polishing some work before a feedback session. If I understand the work well enough to explain it, and I know what kind of feedback I need relative to where I’m at in the process, it doesn’t need to look pretty.</p><p>Or I might welcome real-time collaboration from a trusted colleague in my chaotic Figma working files.

As a cis-gendered white man, I have so much more power and safety in these spaces than so many other people. I can be vulnerable, show rough work, and have much less at stake than most people different than me would. Someone who chooses to not show their rough work might need to do that to keep themselves safe. Challenging ourselves to grow is important, and so is recognizing and respecting people for who they are and what they experience.</p><h2 id="wrapping-it-up"><a href="#wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</a></h2><p>You’ve probably noticed a theme here around human connection and productivity. I believe humans are fundamentally interdependent, communicative, group-oriented creatures. Our wellness and our connection to each other are deeply intertwined. Even in these high tech, high performance, highly fabricated workplaces.</p><p>For people to be creative and productive at their greatest potential, they need to feel good. If doing something helps someone feel safer and more supported, they will do better work. Spending time in that way is a good use of company resources because nourishing genuine human connection <em>is</em> solving a high-impact business problem. We’ll make better things, and all be better off for it.</p><p>Take care!</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="8868da5f3a3d" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>For more activities to do with your team, check out <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/figjam">FigJam templates</a> on the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/explore">Figma Community</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Behind the plugin: Cards for Humanity</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-plugin-cards-for-humanity/</link>
      <description>An interview with the team who built the digital card came</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Idean is a design consultancy that has recently joined <a href="https://www.frogdesign.com/">frog</a>, a global design and strategy consultancy and part of Capgemini Invent. Last year, they built <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/896347534161970744">Cards for Humanity</a>, an online card game that helps teams design accessible, inclusive products. We interviewed them to learn more about how they built the Figma plugin, what they learned, and the power of inclusive design. Hear from Product Designer <a href="https://www.evatkautz.com/">Eva Tkautz</a>, Lead Developer <a href="https://twitter.com/siddvee">Sidd Vadgama</a>, Lead Product Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/charliewileman/?originalSubdomain=uk">Charlie Wileman</a>, and Marketing Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/imogen-lees-profile/">Imogen Lees</a> about the game-making process.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="091858d7e88c" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>When creating new products, it’s crucial to build empathy for people with a wide range of needs. Designing solutions that everyone can use and access is a must-have, not nice-to-have. Early last year, Idean released <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/896347534161970744/Cards-for-Humanity">Cards for Humanity</a>, a card game for introducing inclusive design in client workshops. Once the working world went remote, the team quickly moved the game online to make it more accessible, both as a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/896347534161970744">Figma plugin</a> and as a <a href="https://cardsforhumanity.idean.com/">website</a>.</p><h2 id="into-the-game"><a href="#into-the-game">Into the game</a></h2><p>The game features two kinds of cards: one set of cards shows a person’s name, age, and personality trait, while a second set includes a corresponding need, disability, or personal challenge.</p><p>The game mechanic is simple: deal a pair of cards to create a character, then figure out how to meet their needs. Clicking a card reveals written considerations for listed traits, challenges, and disabilities.</p><figure></figure><p>These considerations help curb any possible assumptions about different conditions and disabilities. The game’s open-ended style of play makes it a flexible tool for workshops, brainstorms, and casual conversations about accessibility and inclusion.</p><p>By putting humans at the center of the design process, the cards solve one of the design industry’s key problems: “We found that it was really difficult to raise inclusive design in a way that was tangible to our clients,” explains Charlie. Designing inclusively doesn’t have to be difficult—it just starts with empathy.</p><h2 id="designing-for-all"><a href="#designing-for-all">Designing for all</a></h2><p>Cards for Humanity required an inclusive and accessible design process from the jump. The team began their journey with internal research, asking each other if they&#39;d be open to sharing their own traits and disabilities.</p><p>Next, they requested input from the online product community to craft a wider list of attributes. The game took off with a lot of momentum, which created some pressure as the team discovered changes they needed to make over time. “Making it as accessible as possible has been the most uphill challenge,” says Sidd. “An inclusivity and accessibility tool needs to itself be inclusive and accessible. We’ve done our best to listen to feedback and iterate on top of it.”</p><p>Feedback is rich and varied, partly because the game’s audience was broader than they had initially anticipated. “When designing inclusive products, your audience might not be the audience you’re expecting,” says Eva. The team had expected strong reception among primarily designers and developers, but was surprised to hear from lawyers, gamers, clinicians, and educators who found it useful. “That just highlights how important it is to consider different audiences and how important it is to make it as accessible as possible through the use of language and avoiding jargon.”</p><div><blockquote><p>“When designing inclusive products, your audience might not be the audience you’re expecting.”</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="balancing-client-needs-with-internal-priorities"><a href="#balancing-client-needs-with-internal-priorities">Balancing client needs with internal priorities</a></h2><p>Working in a creative agency involves two types of work: external client work and internal projects that helps promote the business. Client work is billable, but internal work lacks a direct ROI. Even at Idean, where inclusion is a stated goal and a passion point for the team, there’s a natural tension between billable work and developing tools like Cards for Humanity. Considering the agency’s bottom line, it may seem obvious to focus narrowly on client work. But great product design <em>is</em> the bottom line. Building accessible and inclusive products is part of making better products, better outcomes, and happier clients. “Designing products and services that benefit everyone can only be, or should be, a business imperative, because those products and services can only impact and benefit more people,” Imogen says.</p><p>On an individual level, balancing the work boils down to personal investment. “This is specific to the way things work within our team,” explains Charlie. “There’s been a blend of actually having time for it and people just doing it in their own time, which goes back to the team’s passion for creating tools like this.” And this investment has extended into client work as well. “We see this tool ingrained in our process and therefore ingrained in the work that our clients do,” adds Charlie. “If every client we work with uses this tool, the impact that could have among all the people they’re designing products for is absolutely massive. Seeing clients use it is amazing.”</p><p>The conversation must move beyond profit and resources eventually, though. “Inclusive design is more than just a business case, a missed opportunity, or the right thing to do,” says Eva. “Inclusive design is about inclusion in society. It’s about thinking about the products that we generally design and their use. We as makers, designers, and developers have a responsibility, and we’re hoping that Cards for Humanity will highlight what’s important.”</p><div><blockquote><p>Inclusive design is more than just a business case, a missed opportunity, or the right thing to do.</p></blockquote></div><p>Above all, Cards for Humanity is a way to begin the conversation with your team about accessibility and inclusion. Eva says, “Cards for Humanity doesn’t have to be used in a really specific way; just talking through the cards becomes a really great opener for inclusive design.”</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="f4f03b408191" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Learn more about inclusive design or simply get the conversation started by checking out the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/896347534161970744/Cards-for-Humanity">Cards for Humanity plugin</a> on the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/">Figma Community</a>.

      <title>Introducing Figma’s New York City hub</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-new-york-city-hub/</link>
      <description>We have opened an office in New York City to better connect with Figmates and users</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Katie Szeto is a product manager and member of the New York City landing team—a small group of Figmates (Figma employees) dedicated to spinning up Figma’s newest hub office. In this post, she shares a bit about why Figma is growing in New York City, how we’re thinking about the hybrid work model, and what she’s excited about in the months ahead.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="e805a33f7f1a" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Last year, Figma co-founder &amp; CEO Dylan Field shared how <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-work-is-changing-at-figma/">Figma is moving to a hybrid working model</a>, offering both remote and in-person options. Central to in-person work is what we’re calling hubs—spaces that enable us to better connect with each other and our users around the world. We <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-new-emea-hq/">announced our London hub</a> last September, and today I’m excited to share that Figma’s newest hub is now live in New York City.</p><h2 id="work-that-works-for-you"><a href="#work-that-works-for-you">Work that works for you</a></h2><p>The past year and a half has taught us all many things. And for businesses and employees all over the world, one of these lessons is that distributed work <em>works</em>. For some, it’s the ideal setup—less time spent commuting, more flexibility at home with family, and the ability to pursue different ways of life beyond the city. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-economy-nyc/fleeing-new-yorkers-resulted-in-an-estimated-34-billion-in-lost-income-study-idINKBN28P1Q8">According to Reuters</a>, a net 70,000 people fled the New York Metropolitan Area last year to do just that. </p><p>Many Figmates feel similarly. In an internal survey from Q3 2020, we asked, &#34;<em>If Figma had the option for all roles to be remote, would you consider relocating to a non–Figma hub location before the end of 2022?&#34;</em> 68% of Figmates answered <em>yes</em> or <em>maybe</em>. But for others like me, the serendipitous connection and energy that happens when people gather is invaluable.</p><p>Like many Figmates, I started during the pandemic, so my only experience at Figma has been that of a remote employee. I was worried that I would feel isolated, but my direct team established a culture that encouraged asking for help—I learned that I could be on a Zoom for a quick consult within seconds of reaching out. More broadly, I also found that there are thoughtful structures in place to ensure that all remote employees have a meaningful experience—robust virtual onboarding sessions called <em>Figma Today</em>, a fully online and globally-accessible <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-maker-week-more-than-a-hackathon/">Maker Week</a>, spaces to speak openly and honestly about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-N2maCF840">what has been hard</a>, and more.</p><p>While I’m confident that Figma has the right approach for me to work remotely indefinitely, I simply wanted to be in an office—I knew that being around coworkers in a shared space would be most fulfilling for me. The workplace team at Figma has designed our hubs with this spectrum of preferences in mind and I was intrigued by the way we reimagined the traditional office space. Timadge Berkhadley, Figma’s Director of Workplace and Employee Engagement says, “While on the surface, they may look like typical pre-pandemic tech offices, hubs are really meant to serve as flexible, inspiring spaces where people and ideas converge—no assigned desks, lots of informal gathering places, beautifully designed to spark conversation, curiosity, and experimentation.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b49d7e8c8ff44e6e7b4bac13ed7c3e7945b55838-6240x4160.jpg?rect=2,0,6235,4160&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b49d7e8c8ff44e6e7b4bac13ed7c3e7945b55838-6240x4160.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b49d7e8c8ff44e6e7b4bac13ed7c3e7945b55838-6240x4160.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b49d7e8c8ff44e6e7b4bac13ed7c3e7945b55838-6240x4160.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b49d7e8c8ff44e6e7b4bac13ed7c3e7945b55838-6240x4160.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b49d7e8c8ff44e6e7b4bac13ed7c3e7945b55838-6240x4160.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>From left: Noah Finer (Software Engineering Intern), Sean Chin (Product Designer), Aashima Garg (Software Engineer)</figcaption></figure><h2 id="why-new-york-city"><a href="#why-new-york-city">Why New York City?</a></h2><p>New York City is full of diverse talent, home to many of our incredible customers, and has a <a href="https://www.printmag.com/post/new-york-city-design-capital">rich history of design</a>.

      <title>How News UK developed a multi-brand design system</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-news-uk-developed-a-multi-brand-design-system/</link>
      <description>The team at News UK shares their experience creating a design system across print, online, radio, and TV</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the media industry, the shift to digital-first experiences has posed unique challenges. Not only do publishing companies need to design and adapt for digital, their ability to create new content and evolve quickly determines their fate.</p><p><a href="https://www.news.co.uk/">News UK</a>, an arm of News Corp, grew their product offerings across print, online, radio, and TV to make sure that they were evolving with their customer base. This expansion meant scaling design and development across multiple brands and products. They needed a new design system to organize and manage the process.</p><p>Historically, the various brands—from <em>The Times</em> to <em>The Sun</em>—under News UK have operated completely independently, with separate design orgs, product teams, and even different tools. Uniting these brands under a single system—while adapting to each brand’s unique needs—would be a massive undertaking.</p><p>“Building a design system for all of our brands is challenging. We have a lot of brands with a lot of heritage, and they have tight requirements on how things should look and feel,” says Nick Dorman, Head of Design Systems at News UK. “As designers, it’s our job to understand what product, editorial, and marketing teams want from the design system; their perspectives influence how we approach building the system.”</p><p>To start, the team tried to combine a number of design tools. But pairing Sketch, Abstract, Zeplin, and InVision ultimately resulted in a more disjointed solution. The design systems team would spend days—at times even weeks—trying to update and maintain their libraries. Even simple things like changing the color of text styles became a hassle as they ended up with thousands of styles just to accommodate all of the variants for each brand.</p><p>Plus, the theming features they had built to support the diverse, and growing, product and brand requirements became too rigid and complicated to use. When <em>The Times</em> moved into broadcasting with a new radio station, they became the first consumers of the design system and it became clear that the level of support needed from the design systems team would be unsustainable. Teams weren’t finding it easy to use the new system, and without widespread adoption, the design system couldn’t take off. They needed to rethink their approach.</p><p>At this point, the team decided to migrate to Figma, with the goal of consolidating multiple tools, centralizing library management, and getting their teams to actually use and contribute to the system.<br/></p><h2 id="encouraging-adoption"><a href="#encouraging-adoption">Encouraging adoption</a></h2><p>While a flexible design system is critical to scale, it’s just one part of the equation. Companies often overlook the cultural elements—team norms and processes, values, goals—required to make a design system successful. This was especially important to News UK. “It’s not enough to say, ‘here’s a new design system, please use it,’” says James Davis, Lead Designer. “People really want to understand it and feel they are involved, so we came up with creative ideas to educate and encourage adoption.”</p><p>To help facilitate adoption of the design system, News UK’s design systems team individually set up every designer’s workspace in Figma and onboarded them. The team held tailored workshops and documentation on topics like migrating files from Sketch, structuring and managing files, and using components. Recognizing the importance of including cross-functional partners, they created documentation around how to comment, inspect, and integrate third party tools like Jira.</p><p>To encourage designers to contribute to the design system, the design systems team worked with them to produce component specs and reusable design patterns that they could share across the organization. They even created <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/990170554808116110">tools in Figma</a> to offer guidance on which components to use in a particular scenario, like how to onboard users to a new product or feature.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?rect=0,0,1599,1024&amp;w=670&amp;h=429&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5d44013c39c2c8c51d6b6e413c2752bdb510faac-1600x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The prototype tool that the News UK team created in Figma</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the team recruited a number of designer advocates to promote the design system within the company, improve adoption by sharing best practices, and serve as the main point of contact for the design systems team. The designer advocates champion the usage of the design system within their given product areas and are responsible for keeping their teams up to date with the system&#39;s progress.</p><h2 id="a-design-system-at-scale"><a href="#a-design-system-at-scale">A design system at scale</a></h2><p>The team at News UK wanted designers from each brand to easily leverage the design system. When the team introduced Figma as a replacement for Sketch, Abstract, and the other tools, they went from being burdened by the design system to feeling like it supported their work and made them more efficient.</p><p>“There was a night and day difference after we transitioned to Figma,” Davis says. “Designers saw the potential of the tool and wanted to understand more about it. It acted as a catalyst for building out our design system.”</p><p>After migrating to Figma in just a couple of weeks, News UK now has a design system that flexes to all their brands’ needs. One of the team’s favorite functionalities is the ability to apply different themes to the same components. “We developed a plugin that enables us to experiment and more easily build out individual components that work across multiple brands,” Dorman says. “It also makes the design system feel like it was purpose-built for the brand.”</p><figure><figcaption>News UK&#39;s custom-built Themer plugin in action</figcaption></figure><div><p>Teams can now collaborate and get feedback on their work earlier and more frequently, saving time down the line. “It’s more important than ever that we avoid working in isolation, we need to operate as one team, share knowledge, support each other, and stop reinventing existing solutions,” says Dorman. “Our new design system helps us work in a more interconnected way.”</p><p>With the new multi-brand design system rolled out to all News UK product and design teams, the feedback Dorman and Davis have received is beyond what they had expected. “Every quarter or so, we send out an internal NPS survey to the teams to gather feedback about the design system,” Dorman says. “We saw a 23-point spike in our NPS score in the first quarter following our introduction of Figma–our most significant bounce to date. There’s still more work to be done, but product teams are now buying into the system and reporting real benefits. It’s great to know we’ve built a solid foundation to scale from.”</p></div><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="29535fc41eae" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m grateful that many of our previous investors—Index, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia, and a16z—also participated in this Series E round.</p><p>Our vision is to make design accessible to all. I&#39;m almost nine years into working on Figma and yet I truly believe we&#39;re just getting started in pursuit of that vision. Yes, it’s about multiplayer changing the way people work and build together. It means building expert tools for designers and also embracing every role involved in product development. But above all, it’s about opening up access and empowering teams to think, feel and work in a design-first way. And eventually, it will be about more products for more people to be creative and collaborate visually, no matter what their role.</p><p>We have an opportunity and responsibility to serve the community of designers who have helped us reach this point. And to welcome everyone from students to the C-suite into a broader design community.</p><p>The most important reflection I have for you today is: thank you. The past 16 months of the pandemic have been hard on all of us in different ways. We’ve laughed, cried, worked, and grown together. I’m so grateful for everything you do for Figma, for one another and for our community.<br/></p><p>See you at FigNation!</p><p>Dylan</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="42717616ed29" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>If you&#39;d like to join us, we&#39;re hiring!

      <title>The five stages of an effective brainstorm</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/the-five-stages-of-an-effective-brainstorm/</link>
      <description>Tips from the research and marketing teams at Figma</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Last week, we shared <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-how-our-pm-team-uses-figjam/">how our PM team uses FigJam</a> for every aspect of their team’s process, from idea to retrospective. FigJam was built as a space for teams to ideate together, so we wanted to dive a bit deeper into the earliest stage of collaboration: brainstorming. Product Marketing Manager <a href="https://twitter.com/worldwydewayne">Wayne Ng</a> spoke to <a href="https://twitter.com/cristentor?lang=en">Cristen Torrey</a> on the research team and <a href="https://twitter.com/ahelmbolt?lang=en">Andrea Helmbolt</a> on the growth marketing team to get their tips on running and facilitating an effective brainstorm.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="782642d02dd9" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>If you’re looking to get quick feedback and ideas from your team, you can easily hop into a FigJam file and start jamming. But sometimes you need to facilitate a broader brainstorm—with more people, structure, and time—to solve a bigger problem.</p><p>At their best, brainstorms feel both creative and productive—participants have the space to share moonshot ideas without judgment, and ideally something tactical and tangible comes out of the time together. On the other hand, it can be frustrating to sit through a brainstorm that doesn’t go anywhere. </p><p>Watch the tutorial on how to use FigJam for brainstorms, and read on for tips on how to get started.</p><h2 id="_1-prepare-and-plan-ahead"><a href="#_1-prepare-and-plan-ahead">1. Prepare and plan ahead</a></h2><p>Everyone knows the feelings of leaving a meeting thinking, “Why was I even invited? That could and should have been an email.” The best way to avoid that is to diligently prepare for it beforehand—brainstorms aren’t just about the activity itself, they&#39;re about what you do before and after you’ve generated ideas. This checklist can get you started:</p><ul><li><strong>Set the context:</strong> Make sure everyone knows why they were invited and how they can best contribute. A quick Slack message or notes in the calendar invite will do the trick.</li><li><strong>Share reading materials:</strong> Send a pre-read, brief, or a Figma file in advance so participants can learn more and get aligned ahead of time.</li><li><strong>Organize pre-meetings:</strong> Preview your ideas with your collaborators and get their feedback. This allows you to get a head-start on addressing their concerns and, more importantly, make them feel like they&#39;re a part of the process. While a quick Slack message will often suffice, Andrea notes that pre-meetings with different stakeholders can be helpful: “Sometimes the meeting before the meeting can have a space, if used sparingly.” </li></ul><h2 id="_2-make-introductions-and-manage-expectations"><a href="#_2-make-introductions-and-manage-expectations">2. Make introductions and manage expectations</a></h2><p>Facilitators play a crucial role in creating a positive environment in which teammates feel open and included. Here are a few things you can do to get everyone excited about the brainstorm and ready to participate:</p><ul><li><strong>Start with an icebreaker:</strong> Get the group’s creative juices flowing with an activity: <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/964643468321702755">animal drawing</a> or making <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/964662308542147436">collaborator cards</a> allow for quick introductions. Cristen says it’s really about creating “a generative, creative mindset right from the start.”</li><li><strong>Set the tone</strong>: Co-create rules of engagement so everyone feels open and included.</li><li><strong>Set the tone:</strong> Co-create rules of engagement so everyone feels open and included. For half-day research workshops, Cristen starts with a quick discussion about the group’s expectations. Is it ok to be on Slack? Or do we expect everyone’s full attention? She said shared agreements are the way to go.</li><li><strong>Manage expectations:</strong> Be upfront about the goal of the brainstorm. While having too many great ideas is a good problem to have, be clear and say, “We’re not going to use all the ideas,” Andrea says.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44bb6feac042a080a15ec7a1e284449e0ee50d3e-1974x1020.png?rect=0,0,1974,1019&amp;w=670&amp;h=346&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44bb6feac042a080a15ec7a1e284449e0ee50d3e-1974x1020.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44bb6feac042a080a15ec7a1e284449e0ee50d3e-1974x1020.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44bb6feac042a080a15ec7a1e284449e0ee50d3e-1974x1020.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44bb6feac042a080a15ec7a1e284449e0ee50d3e-1974x1020.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44bb6feac042a080a15ec7a1e284449e0ee50d3e-1974x1020.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Make introductions by filling out these collaborators cards: draw in yourself or use it to frame a profile photo</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_3-generate-ideas"><a href="#_3-generate-ideas">3.

This could be a prompt beginning with “How might we…” or starting small with an exercise. In a brainstorm where participants are prompted to sketch out UI patterns, Andrea often asks participants to draw a circle, square, and triangle. She then reminds them that if they can draw these simple shapes,  they can definitely participate in the brainstorm.</li><li><strong>Find a north star:</strong> Create a shared understanding of what you’re doing in the brainstorm and what you expect after the fact. That can be as simple as a statement like “We want to solve for X and come away with Y.” Visualizing the end goal will focus the team and make sure they know how their work will contribute.</li><li><strong>Reward wild ideas:</strong> Prepare a small, silly prize to keep things fun and engaging. Andrea has gifted stickers, selfie sticks, and gift cards to a local coffee shop for the person with the wildest moonshot idea.</li></ul><p>Andrea says the number one reason why some people avoid brainstorms is that it’s hard to go from the generative idea phase to the tactical next steps. Diverging and coming up with as many ideas as possible is one thing, but it’s important to converge and hone in on the right ideas to pursue.</p><p>These steps can get you started:</p><ul><li><strong>Dig deeper:</strong> Ask questions and push on each other’s suggestions. As Andrea says, you can discuss and refine ideas together: “You don’t have to take the idea at face value.”</li><li><strong>Assess ideas against outcomes:</strong> Evaluate each idea and see how it maps to the north star you created at the beginning of the session. With this <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/973549661473689958">Impact vs. Effort template</a>, you can quickly prioritize the most impactful projects.</li><li><strong>Assign owners:</strong> Be clear on next steps, starting with who owns what. It is much easier to move things forward if there are DRIs for each part of the workstream.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e5647c32840ed3e84a07f8554f2553d7106022a8-1982x1016.png?rect=0,0,1982,1015&amp;w=670&amp;h=343&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e5647c32840ed3e84a07f8554f2553d7106022a8-1982x1016.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e5647c32840ed3e84a07f8554f2553d7106022a8-1982x1016.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e5647c32840ed3e84a07f8554f2553d7106022a8-1982x1016.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e5647c32840ed3e84a07f8554f2553d7106022a8-1982x1016.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e5647c32840ed3e84a07f8554f2553d7106022a8-1982x1016.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>This template, by James Norton, is a helpful starting point for choosing and prioritizing projects</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_5-follow-up-with-the-team"><a href="#_5-follow-up-with-the-team">5. Follow up with the team</a></h2><p>Following a brainstorm in FigJam, Andrea says that consolidating and synthesizing input is key. Someone should be able to go back to the file a few weeks after the brainstorm and see where you ended up.</p><p>In addition to cleaning up your file, spend time communicating results and next steps with the broader team:</p><ul><li><strong>Establish a shared understanding:</strong> Take the time to make sure everyone is aligned. Whether it’s five minutes at the end of the brainstorm or a separate follow-up meeting, making sure everyone is on the same page should be top of mind. As Cristen says, “If one person is not on the bus, you figure out how to bring them back on.”</li><li><strong>Create a visual artifact:</strong> Map the ideas you plan to execute on. When you’re ready to develop a project plan, you can use a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/964647182384107366">Gantt chart</a>, or anchor them an existing framework such as a 2x2 matrix or <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/964691885570343790">user journey</a>.</li><li><strong>Share outcomes:</strong> Circulate the outcome of the brainstorm with participants, and anyone else on the team who needs visibility. Follow-up notes can go a long way in keeping everyone on the same page.</li></ul><p>Whatever your goals, Cristen and Andrea recommend <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/figjam">leaning on templates</a>. As Cristen says, “You don’t need to reinvent the wheel.” Sometimes, you don’t even need a synchronous brainstorm at all. For certain projects, you can just hop into a FigJam file and start jamming.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="8d089c8b737e" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Learn more about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW2MjtAb2mU">how to use FigJam for brainstorms</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/figjam">check out all of the templates</a> on the Figma Community.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are so many ways to work collaboratively in FigJam, so we talked to Figmates across the company to learn how they come together in the file. Below, we’re sharing insights from the product, engineering, and research teams on how to meet, connect, and work in FigJam—together.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="3d369b6e0963" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>After over a year working remotely, we’ve found a new home for virtual activities and meetings in FigJam. While <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figjam/">we first built FigJam</a> for brainstorming and ideating, we’ve found new ways to bring the magic of in-person meetings to the activities we run online, including stand-ups, research and synthesis, retrospectives—even offsites.</p><h2 id="stand-ups-in-the-browser"><a href="#stand-ups-in-the-browser">Stand-ups in the browser</a></h2><p>Visibility and context are key to keeping the team on the same page. Figma’s Editor Platform team stays in sync by holding a daily stand-up. Product Manager <a href="https://twitter.com/brsabel">Bersabel Tadesse</a> created a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/964902611071727475">virtual stand-up template</a> that’s similar to the one she uses with her engineering partners. While the PM team has their own template for in-depth, weekly <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/983784098493841378">team meetings</a>, this one is uniquely built for a quick, daily check-in.<br/></p><p>In the morning, teammates gather in the file together and add stickies to track current and recent work, plus any blockers or issues they may need to problem solve. Each FigJam stand-up file acts as an artifact of a single day, making it easy for the team to understand their progress across time.</p><h2 id="synthesizing-feedback"><a href="#synthesizing-feedback">Synthesizing feedback</a></h2><p>It’s natural to think of FigJam as primarily a tool for jotting down quick thoughts or generating ideas, but our research team enjoys it as a place to connect over deep concepts. Researcher Vanessa Van Schyndel uses FigJam to help Figmates tighten product feedback loops around FigJam. (Meta.)</p><p>Previously, the Figma research team used spreadsheets to track product feedback from Figma users. If a Figmate had questions about a piece of feedback, they would have to leave a comment on its cell in the spreadsheet. Beyond being difficult to manage, the process made it nearly impossible to draw group insights outside of synchronous conversation, leading to long meetings and tons of spreadsheet searching. With FigJam, Vanessa and the research team can not only track user input, but also create a space for cross-functional partners to comment, ask questions, and engage more deeply with the material.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670&amp;h=450&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b91f5ef4bdb26971b165c5a12b4de08a5931db99-1600x1075.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A matrix created by Ollie Ronaldson of The Value Engineers</figcaption></figure><p>Above is one of multiple matrix templates Vanessa and the research team use. In this one, Figmates fill up with takeaways from a research report concerning different archetypes of FigJam users. Recently, Vanessa invited leaders across Figma’s design, engineering, and product teams to read the report and fill out the FigJam file on their own before meeting to discuss the research together.</p><h2 id="reviewing-work-and-sharing-credit"><a href="#reviewing-work-and-sharing-credit">Reviewing work and sharing credit</a></h2><p>We recently shared <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-how-our-pm-team-uses-figjam/#running-retrospectives">how the PM team runs retrospectives</a> in FigJam. Other teams follow the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/964642284354524001">same template</a>, including what went well, areas for improvement, shout-outs, and ideas for future building. In a recent retrospective including engineering, design, and product management, Engineer Karl Jiang noted that FigJam creates a low barrier to entry for people who are shy about giving feedback. This is the real power of FigJam stickies—auto-labeling provides an advantage for widespread teams with varied levels of verbal participation: in FigJam, everyone&#39;s contributions are automatically visible from a quick scan.</p><p>It is easy to find yourself in the weeds in a retro, so the FigJam timer comes in handy for facilitators who want to keep retros moving at a steady pace. On Karl’s team, every Figmate takes 15 minutes to provide thoughts for each topic by placing stickies all over the matrix.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40d10027b95283a2614f0b27b89e1370cf9cf349-1808x1282.png?w=670&amp;h=475&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40d10027b95283a2614f0b27b89e1370cf9cf349-1808x1282.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40d10027b95283a2614f0b27b89e1370cf9cf349-1808x1282.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40d10027b95283a2614f0b27b89e1370cf9cf349-1808x1282.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40d10027b95283a2614f0b27b89e1370cf9cf349-1808x1282.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40d10027b95283a2614f0b27b89e1370cf9cf349-1808x1282.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Retro done in FigJam across engineers, designers, and PMs</figcaption></figure><h2 id="celebrating-team-culture"><a href="#celebrating-team-culture">Celebrating team culture</a></h2><p>Beyond the work, FigJam has become a natural place for Figmates to celebrate and hang out.

      <description>Templates for you and your team to get started with everything from brainstorms to retrospectives.</description>

Long before we launched FigJam in beta, teams across Figma had been using it for  everything from user research to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-maker-week-more-than-a-hackathon/">Maker Week</a> projects. Here, Product Manager <a href="https://twitter.com/eymlin">Emily Lin</a> shares how she and the PM team at Figma use FigJam, along with templates to get you started.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="0aa5be4fa9ad" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We built FigJam as a space for designers to ideate and brainstorm with their extended teams. In many ways, it’s a place where ideas begin. But on the product management team at Figma, we’ve used it across the development process—from ideation to retrospective—and to overhaul team rituals and processes. Ever since we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC-eh1ObTDA&amp;list=PLXDU_eVOJTx68R0B8tettMfY6XeItWhV4&amp;index=4&amp;t=1s">built FigJam in FigJam</a>, we’ve spent the past year refining the ways we use FigJam as a team.</p><h2 id="developing-a-vision"><a href="#developing-a-vision">Developing a vision</a></h2><p>H2 planning is around the corner, so we’ve been relying on a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/967200294980848996">product vision board</a> to build out our short- and long-term priorities. With this template, we can validate our product strategy by visualizing user needs, features, and business goals. FigJam allows us to quickly jot down ideas—without fussing over specific phrasing—while seeing how our plans ladder up to a bigger picture.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4524566fd88567fd5a9d1a9b190cc2836511ae7c-2680x1378.png?rect=2,0,2676,1378&amp;w=670&amp;h=345&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4524566fd88567fd5a9d1a9b190cc2836511ae7c-2680x1378.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4524566fd88567fd5a9d1a9b190cc2836511ae7c-2680x1378.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4524566fd88567fd5a9d1a9b190cc2836511ae7c-2680x1378.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4524566fd88567fd5a9d1a9b190cc2836511ae7c-2680x1378.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4524566fd88567fd5a9d1a9b190cc2836511ae7c-2680x1378.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>How the Figma PM team uses the Product vision board</figcaption></figure><h2 id="brainstorming-ideas"><a href="#brainstorming-ideas">Brainstorming ideas</a></h2><p>FigJam was built as a home to share, riff, and build on each other’s ideas. While you don’t need a template to brainstorm in FigJam, the PM team likes using the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/964652140702534507">Brainstorm Crazy 8’s</a> framework. For this activity, the team gets eight minutes to come up with eight ideas for solving a problem. The goal is to quickly get ideas down in FigJam, without worrying much about the details. At the end of eight minutes, we share out ideas and discuss the ones worth solving after the brainstorming session.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d492779d5dd1cf9643420aa2e85dbafa044fe12a-1888x1082.png?rect=35,16,1815,1040&amp;w=670&amp;h=384&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d492779d5dd1cf9643420aa2e85dbafa044fe12a-1888x1082.png?rect=19,16,1846,1040&amp;w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d492779d5dd1cf9643420aa2e85dbafa044fe12a-1888x1082.png?rect=19,16,1846,1040&amp;w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d492779d5dd1cf9643420aa2e85dbafa044fe12a-1888x1082.png?rect=19,16,1846,1040&amp;w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d492779d5dd1cf9643420aa2e85dbafa044fe12a-1888x1082.png?rect=19,16,1846,1040&amp;w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d492779d5dd1cf9643420aa2e85dbafa044fe12a-1888x1082.png?rect=19,16,1846,1040&amp;w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The Crazy 8&#39;s framework prompts participants to jot down a quick idea in each of the eight squares</figcaption></figure><h2 id="visualizing-a-roadmap"><a href="#visualizing-a-roadmap">Visualizing a roadmap</a></h2><p>While FigJam is great for freeform exploration, we also use it for more structured processes, like building a product roadmap. We even used <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/964647182384107366">this Gantt chart</a> in FigJam to build the roadmap for FigJam! One thing I like about this format is that it’s easy to visualize the scope and reach of different projects. This allows us to get a sense for how we should resource and staff different workstreams, and makes it clear when we need to reprioritize. Going into planning for Q3 and the second half of the year, I know this is a template we’ll be using regularly.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/946454f98e86794166a11af31938d3d9a662c7ad-2680x1378.png?rect=2,0,2676,1378&amp;w=670&amp;h=345&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/946454f98e86794166a11af31938d3d9a662c7ad-2680x1378.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/946454f98e86794166a11af31938d3d9a662c7ad-2680x1378.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/946454f98e86794166a11af31938d3d9a662c7ad-2680x1378.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/946454f98e86794166a11af31938d3d9a662c7ad-2680x1378.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/946454f98e86794166a11af31938d3d9a662c7ad-2680x1378.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The Gantt chart is useful for short- and long-term planning</figcaption></figure><h2 id="running-retrospectives"><a href="#running-retrospectives">Running retrospectives</a></h2><p>Since retrospectives are such an important part of product development, we stick to a template so everyone knows what to expect. Our product, engineering, and design teams will jump into a FigJam file (like <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/964642284354524001">this one</a>) to retro product execution, while the marketing, support, and product education teams will review go-to-market activities. This starts a conversation on what went well and what we can do better next time, and gives teams visibility into each other’s work.

Cursor chats, stickers, and emotes are some of our favorite ways to make the meetings more interactive.

      <description>Reflections on Pride month, and how you can participate</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clancyslack/">Clancy Slack</a>, Data Scientist and lead of the Pride Employee Resource Group (ERG) at Figma, shares what Pride month means to him, how we’re participating at Figma, and a call to designers, artists, and makers to create Pride posters in Figma.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="8fc8b74888d6" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Figma’s mission is to make design accessible to all. That means we spend a lot of time thinking about lowering barriers, leveling the playing field, and fostering communities of belonging and shared interests. And, it’s part of why we built <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-community/">Figma Community</a>, where hundreds of thousands of Figma users come together each week. We believe that nothing great is built alone, and rely on each other and our community to create better—together.</p><p>Like many companies in our industry, we have a handful of internal Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) that connect Figmates around shared identities. For members of the LGBTQ+ community, having space at work to be authentic and open is so important. I have led the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGcIqmYMdhQ">Pride ERG</a> since it was founded in 2019. Even before that, the LGBTQ+ community at Figma was organically coming together and hosting events to elevate our stories and the issues facing the broader community.</p><p>This year, as a part of our most recent <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-maker-week-more-than-a-hackathon/">Maker Week</a>, the Pride group got together to share examples of Pride iconography that inspire us and co-designed some pieces of our own.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/12725f5d3265bd37bf1cddf200f03bcd63ffe419-1606x429.png?w=670&amp;h=179&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/12725f5d3265bd37bf1cddf200f03bcd63ffe419-1606x429.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/12725f5d3265bd37bf1cddf200f03bcd63ffe419-1606x429.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/12725f5d3265bd37bf1cddf200f03bcd63ffe419-1606x429.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/12725f5d3265bd37bf1cddf200f03bcd63ffe419-1606x429.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/12725f5d3265bd37bf1cddf200f03bcd63ffe419-1606x429.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="pride-feels-different-this-year"><a href="#pride-feels-different-this-year">Pride feels different this year</a></h2><p>For many in the LGBTQ+ community, it’s one of very few outlets throughout the year when we feel safe to express ourselves authentically, be surrounded by our community, and celebrate the progress that’s come before us. It is a chance to dance and cheer and feel part of something bigger than ourselves. But of course, Pride wasn’t always a parade. It honors the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots">1969 Stonewall Uprising</a>, where demonstrators had finally had enough of anti-LGBTQ police raids at the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village.</p><p>2020 held many stark reminders of injustice. As we were stuck at home in the middle of the pandemic, we were also reminded of the power of community, even from afar. And while the road to justice, equality, and equity is long, for me, Pride became a beacon of hope.</p><p>Fast forward to today, and it’s time to get back out there. With vaccinations rolling out around the world, many cities will be hosting in-person Pride parades. And along with friends, families, and fabulous rainbow couture, what else do you need for a Pride parade? Posters, of course…</p><h2 id="a-call-for-pride-posters"><a href="#a-call-for-pride-posters">A call for Pride posters</a></h2><p>Calling all designers, artists, and makers to create Pride posters in Figma. Publish your work to the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/explore">Figma Community</a> with #pride for others to print and bring to their local parades or take the Pride spirit to their homes—we’ll pin a featured collection to the Community page.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>We asked speakers at Config 2021 to share stories about the challenges, obstacles, and difficult moments that ultimately make products better. Below, we’re sharing some of the highlights. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx68R0B8tettMfY6XeItWhV4">watch the videos on YouTube</a>, and read on for some of our favorite moments.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="073e641d4ced" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>At Config 2021, many of the sessions covered best practices for <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/shifting-team-culture-at-config-2021/">shifting team culture</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/in-the-file-at-config-2021/">building scalable processes</a>. But difficult moments can put even the strongest teams and systems to the test. So much of your success comes down to how you handle project delays, unforeseen obstacles, and interpersonal conflicts. Here, we’re sharing tips from leaders at Shopify and Headspace on how to do just that.</p><h2 id="navigating-setbacks"><a href="#navigating-setbacks">Navigating setbacks</a></h2><p>After working on a project for a year and a half, <a href="https://config.figma.com/speakers/shanique-shields/">Shanique Shields</a>, Senior Designer at Shopify, heard that the team was going to roll back the feature. “At this moment,” Shanique says. “I felt like a failure. I didn’t know how to fix it.” At first, Shanique took the setback personally. Once she took a break from the project, she gained a new perspective that allowed her to see the project as a learning experience. “I realized that maybe I was too close to my work and I needed to take a step back,” she says.</p><p>Shanique came away with four tips after reflecting on the experience:</p><ul><li><strong>It’s not about you</strong> - Instead of taking things personally, remember that feedback is likely not a reflection on you or the quality of your work. Rather, it’s probably just a stakeholder or client who has a different way of thinking about things.</li><li><strong>Document everything</strong> - Even if something doesn’t ship, writing down your thought process, preserving comments in Figma, and saving notes to yourself can help you understand what to do differently next time. Plus, other designers will be able to look back at your work as an artifact and learn from it.</li><li><strong>Be intentional with your growth</strong> - When you’re working on a project, think about what you’re getting from it—whether it’s a new skill, exposure to a different part of the business, or an opportunity to pair with a cross-functional partner.</li><li><strong>Hype yourself up</strong> - Failure can feel really tough. But soon enough, you’ll find yourself diving into your next project. Use the next workstream as a chance to start fresh, and rally your team around a shared goal.</li></ul><p>“Initially I felt like I had wasted a year of my life on this project,” Shanique says. But by doing that exercise, I realized that I’m actually proud and learned so much.”</p><h2 id="talking-openly-and-listening-closely"><a href="#talking-openly-and-listening-closely">Talking openly and listening closely</a></h2><p>Even if you have scalable systems and a strong team culture, sometimes communication just breaks down. When you come up against points of friction with teammates, <a href="https://config.figma.com/speakers/frank-bach/">Frank Bach</a>, Lead Product Designer at Headspace, says that openness is the key to resolving conflict. “Try to be as transparent as possible and try to really hear what the other person has to say,” Frank says.</p><p>Even if having a tough conversation feels daunting, it’ll get you a lot further than letting the issue fester. “Try to be candid, objective, and step into your courageous heart to have that tough conversation and try to get through it,” he says. “You can’t get anywhere if you ignore the friction.”</p><p>And, it’s important to acknowledge when things go well. More than anything, Frank recommends practicing gratitude—”being grateful for being a designer, the work you get to do, the team you get to work for or work with,” he says.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="dfbd2927eba6" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em>If you’re interested in more learnings and takeaways from Config 2021, check out all of the talks on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx68R0B8tettMfY6XeItWhV4">Figma’s YouTube channel</a>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What would you like to bring back: Apple 1990s aesthetic or web 1990s aesthetic?</strong><br/>90s web aesthetics &lt;blink&gt;blink&lt;/blink&gt;.</p><p><strong>2. Favorite font for UI?</strong><br/>Montserrat.</p><p><strong>3. Type or color?</strong><br/>Akzidenz-Grotesk.</p><p><strong>4. Hex or RGB or HSL?</strong><br/>Hex #000000.</p><p><strong>5. Describe your creative process in one word.</strong><br/>Intentional.</p><p><strong>6. When do you feel you’re at your best?</strong><br/>I feel at my best when I have personal time to spend with side projects. I need space and time to be creative outside of work.</p><p><strong>7. What’s your idea of the perfect design?</strong><br/>The design that solves a problem that I didn’t realize needed to be solved, but once it was solved I couldn’t live without it.</p><p><strong>8. What’s your greatest design fear?</strong><br/>Someone not having any reaction to my work.</p><p><strong>9. What’s your biggest design pet peeve?</strong><br/>Designing for yourself.</p><p><strong>10. What makes a good teammate or collaborator?</strong><br/>Someone who is curious and doesn’t have an ego.</p><p><strong>11. Who do you admire and why?</strong><br/>Issa Rae—she’s a phenom. Writing, producing, and acting all while being authentic to herself and her story.</p><p><strong>12. What in the design world do you feel is overrated?</strong><br/>Being a thought leader.</p><p><strong>13. Underrated?</strong><br/>Leveraging data to inform your work.</p><p><strong>14. What’s one thing you dislike about the last thing you shipped?</strong><br/>That it took us so long to remove it when it wasn’t meaningfully benefiting people.</p><p><strong>15. What one design do you wish you were the mastermind behind?</strong><br/>I’m a huge fan of Porsche as a company and a car maker and would love to be the mastermind behind their ecosystem—from the driving experience to the app.</p><p><strong>16. What makes a team feel like a team?</strong><br/>There are a couple things that make a team feel like a team to me:</p><ul><li>Everyone is seeking feedback from each other because we trust each other and know that we’re all trying to make us and the team better.</li><li>Team members inspire one another either through their work of perspectives.</li><li>There is no ego.</li></ul><p><strong>17. How would you describe your relationship with Design Twitter?</strong><br/>I try to be a mentor within the Design Twitter community. I’ve had to navigate the tech world as a design practitioner and leader and I share my experience to help designers whenever I can.</p><p><strong>18. What’s something you’ve loved on the internet recently?</strong><br/>Afrotech had a virtual conference where you made an avatar and traveled to a virtual world. It was great that the conference was virtual, but also had a sense of presence.</p><p><strong>19. Given the choice of anyone in the world, whom would you want in your design critique?</strong><br/>Clement Mok, who was the first professional designer I was made aware of early in my career. His work had an impression on me and I’d love to hear his thoughts on the work my team is doing today.</p><p><strong>20. What’s an unsung design that you think is great and why?</strong><br/>Roblox - while not conventionally thought of in a design context, the game allows kids to play, socialize, and build, which is counter to so many apps that are purely about consumption.</p><p><strong>21. What is the greatest accomplishment of your career so far?</strong><br/>Building the most diverse team in tech.</p><p><strong>22. Is there something that you’ve dreamed of designing for a long time?</strong><br/>I’ve wanted to design a car interface for a long time.</p><p><strong>23. What does design mean to you?</strong><br/>Design is problem solving through form and function.</p><p><strong>24. What would you tell your young designer self about being a designer?</strong><br/>Make sure to study adjacent disciplines like business, engineering, and finance to make you a more well rounded thinker.</p><p><strong>25. Favorite Figma feature?</strong><br/>Observation mode.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="60eebb3011b2" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em>For more on Dantley’s experience, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKQCiyTtros">watch his keynote</a> from Config 2021.

      <description>The tactics, processes, and systems that keep teams running</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Yesterday, we released all of the videos from day two of Config 2021, Figma’s virtual design conference. Here, we’re highlighting some of our favorite moments from the breakout sessions. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx68R0B8tettMfY6XeItWhV4">watch the videos on YouTube</a>, and read on for some tactical tips and takeaways.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="61a1b8fd9088" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Across the 40+ sessions at Config 2021, there were a number of talks at different altitudes—personal stories, industry insights, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/shifting-team-culture-at-config-2021/">deep-dives on team culture</a>. Beyond looking for inspiration, we know that many (us included!) come to Config to learn. Whether your team is just starting out or gearing up for rapid growth, process is top of mind. Here is a look at the tactics, systems, and best practices that keep the design teams at Coda and Stripe running.</p><h2 id="balancing-intuition-and-insights"><a href="#balancing-intuition-and-insights">Balancing intuition and insights</a></h2><p><a href="https://config.figma.com/speakers/helena-jaramillo/">Helena Jaramillo</a> joined the design team at Coda just as they set out to build a publishing platform, with the goal of allowing users to share best practices and discover documents. Unlike past projects that were focused on redesigning or optimizing an existing product, Helena was tasked with building something from scratch. Going from 0 to 1 can be tough. For Helena, it’s all about cultivating expertise so you can rally your team around a shared vision, even when you’re just getting started.</p><h3 id="build-context"><a href="#build-context">Build context</a></h3><p>In previous projects, Helena had been able to leverage data to support her efforts. Since she and the team at Coda were building something from the ground up, she didn’t have the benefit of context and insights. “You don&#39;t have existing users’ behavior, you don&#39;t even have users that you can interview for research,” Helena says. To fill in those gaps, Helena researched competitors and products in adjacent spaces. She annotated screenshots in a Figma file, sharing inspiration, and pointing out approaches that may not be a fit for Coda.</p><h3 id="develop-a-strong-perspective"><a href="#develop-a-strong-perspective">Develop a strong perspective</a></h3><p>To rally the team around building a publishing platform, Helena knew it was important to have a clear vision. First, she asked questions to articulate why people would publish on Coda, and what Coda could uniquely bring to the table: “Was publishing on Coda going to feel more like publishing a blog post? Or was it going to feel more like publishing a no-code app? Or was it going to feel more like publishing a website?” she asks.</p><p>To answer these questions, Helena called on her own experience as a publisher, and bounced around ideas with her team to see what would resonate. They arrived on two priorities: make the process easy, and ensure that publishers would be proud of their work. These priorities resulted in product decisions—a flow that made it easy to publish interactive docs, and the ability to add a photo, subtitle, and byline so that publishers could take credit for their work. In the absence of existing user insights, they trusted each other’s instincts and built a strong POV as a team.</p><h3 id="tell-the-broader-story"><a href="#tell-the-broader-story">Tell the broader story</a></h3><p>When Helena shared her insights and vision with the Coda product team, it wasn’t just about aligning on the right features and functionality—she wanted to tell a story. She created a “tl;dr page” in Figma to get her cross-functional partners on board, showing a flow with a handful of mockups that effectively narrated what they were building. “The tl;dr page was helpful for when someone wanted to understand what I was doing but didn’t have all the details,” says Helena. It wasn’t meant to explain how all the features worked, but simply show the story we were trying to create.”</p><h2 id="solving-short-term-needs-while-building-for-scale"><a href="#solving-short-term-needs-while-building-for-scale">Solving short-term needs while building for scale</a></h2><p><a href="https://config.figma.com/speakers/connie-yang/">Connie Yang</a>, <a href="https://config.figma.com/speakers/tayler-aitken/">Tayler Atiken</a>, and the rest of the design team at Stripe endeavor to make complex processes as simple and easy as possible for businesses and end users alike. The team operates on four main principles, which inform their processes, tactics, and systems:</p><h3 id="think-in-really-long-time-scales"><a href="#think-in-really-long-time-scales">Think in really long time scales</a></h3><p>Connie calls this a “city planner mentality.” “We&#39;re not thinking about how we build individual buildings or cars, but we&#39;re thinking about questions like: how wide should the streets be? Where and how should traffic flow? What connects to what? How do we prepare for fires and disasters?” she says. Ultimately, the team asks themselves, “How do we move with urgency and focus while also building for the year 2030?”</p><h3 id="lay-strong-foundations"><a href="#lay-strong-foundations">Lay strong foundations</a></h3><p>Establishing the right infrastructure and processes is key to that forward-looking approach. “Solid foundations means things like making sure we build products and platforms that are fast and accessible. It means we invest in the creation of systems that scale rather than short-sighted fixes,” Connie says. For example, the color system tables in Stripe’s design system have built-in contrast and accessibility ratings. The result is a stronger structure for the team to build on, and a better experience for Stripe’s users.</p><h3 id="prioritize-rigor-and-quality"><a href="#prioritize-rigor-and-quality">Prioritize rigor and quality</a></h3><p>At Stripe, Connie says, “Details matter.” Since businesses use Stripe to accept payments and send payouts, user trust is top of mind. This means building things that are a little harder, but ultimately make the experience better for the user. “A user interface that is perfectly polished and works exactly as you would expect is critical to earning and keeping the trust of our customers,” says Connie.</p><h3 id="inspire-confidence"><a href="#inspire-confidence">Inspire confidence</a></h3><p>The team at Stripe deals with technical infrastructure that has to be both compliant and easy to use, so the work can get complex. Rather than over-simplifying concepts, one of Stripe’s guiding principles is to talk “up” to users, while helping them through challenging situations. “We are the primary, and often only, source of revenue for most of our customers,&#34; says Connie. And that means a lot of actions they try to take can be really scary. If something goes wrong, there can be serious consequences.&#34; </p><p>For example, dealing with a disputed charge can be tricky for a merchant. In Stripe, the merchant will see helpful tips, informing them of what to expect in a clear and straightforward way. “We guide users towards specific solutions and try to lighten their cognitive load so they can get their work done,” says Connie.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="6c66fe4a52c3" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>While it can take some time to figure out the right processes and systems, investing in them now will provide a strong foundation that grows and evolves with you—whatever that looks like for you and your team.</p><p>If you’d like to hear more tactical tips Config 2021, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx68R0B8tettMfY6XeItWhV4">watch all the sessions on YouTube</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Inside Maker Week: more than a hackathon</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-maker-week-more-than-a-hackathon/</link>
      <description>A behind-the-scenes look at a Figma tradition, and some of our favorite moments</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Starting today, it’s <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-making-of-maker-week/">Maker Week</a> at Figma, a time for Figmates across teams to explore projects outside of their day-to-day work. To document the projects (and festivities!), a different Figmate will take over our <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/figmadesign/">Instagram</a> accounts each day this week. Below, we’re sharing more on the origins of this Figma tradition, reflecting on some of our favorite moments, and giving you a peek at what to expect this week.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="dff5f5a01327" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We have a strong “maker” culture here at Figma. In our weekly All Hands meetings—affectionately called FigNation—we invite new Figmates to share how they’re a maker. When I first started, I was intimidated by this idea. I never considered myself a maker—I’m really more of a <em>curator</em> than a <em>creator</em>. But I quickly learned that being a maker is less about identifying as an artist or craftsperson, and more about expressing our creativity in whatever way feels authentic to each of us.</p><h2 id="enter-maker-week"><a href="#enter-maker-week">Enter: Maker Week</a></h2><p>Twice a year, Figmates are invited to pause day-to-day work and come together for a week of innovation and connection. Our take on a cross-functional hackathon, Maker Week is an opportunity to take a step back and live our <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">values</a>—thinking big and bold ideas, connecting with one another, and putting our individual stamps on the business, community, and culture we&#39;re collectively building.</p><p>Hackathons are a pretty common way for engineering, product, and design teams to come together and jam on ideas or projects that haven’t been prioritized. The problem is that they can sometimes feel exclusive to non-technical teams. For me, the magic of Maker Week is that Figmates across teams, product areas, and time zones are invited to participate in what feels more like a maker festival. Technical expertise isn’t a prerequisite, and the result is more cross-pollination of ideas, shared ownership in what we’re creating, and a better understanding of the role we each play in building Figma. In the past, recruiters have made employee baseball cards to share with candidates looking to learn more about their prospective teams, interns built a Name That Figmate game to help us all get to know one another, and data scientists taught chemistry fundamentals with a baking lesson.</p><p>Since 2018, we’ve hosted five Maker Weeks, resulting in hundreds of projects. And, we’ve shipped many of these externally, from core product features like <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-the-making-of-the-new-auto-layout/">auto layout</a>, <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061175334-Create-interactive-components-with-variants">interactive components</a>, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-plugins/">plugins</a> to others that provide a peek into our culture, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHXmj3hN5mI">Figma in Quarantine: The Musical</a>. You might argue that, at its core, <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam</a> is basically the culmination of a number of Maker Week projects over the years.</p><p>To prepare for this year’s first Maker Week, we invited Figmates to take a look back at previous projects for inspiration. Here are a few that we think are pretty neat:</p><h3 id="empathy-building-cards"><a href="#empathy-building-cards">Empathy building cards</a></h3><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a2c0eb063c22c9a8f606e225b5e24c94799802c-1618x1428.png?rect=0,0,1618,1427&amp;w=670&amp;h=591&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a2c0eb063c22c9a8f606e225b5e24c94799802c-1618x1428.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a2c0eb063c22c9a8f606e225b5e24c94799802c-1618x1428.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a2c0eb063c22c9a8f606e225b5e24c94799802c-1618x1428.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a2c0eb063c22c9a8f606e225b5e24c94799802c-1618x1428.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a2c0eb063c22c9a8f606e225b5e24c94799802c-1618x1428.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Project by Christa Simon (Research), Radhika Parashar (Sales Enablement), Remilla Ty (Brand Design)</figcaption></figure><p>Understanding our users and building for their evolving needs is always top of mind.

Rather than anchoring around one theme, as we have in the past, we’ll be working (and celebrating, of course) within four “Frames”: Exploring, Refining, Learning, and Connecting. Where a theme is designed to spark inspiration beyond how we typically operate, Frames aim to expand accessibility and loosely anchor the work to our values. The hope is that they give Figmates—no matter their tenure or technical ability—the opening to make something great, together. And while one of the main pillars of Maker Week is to work across teams, we realize that many Figmates will continue supporting our users, ensuring high performance, and keeping our infrastructure sound. Thank you to the true heroes of Maker Week.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fe4cd08c7abfffe9c5ee6023889a3dd7aff40dd4-1600x851.png?rect=0,0,1600,850&amp;w=670&amp;h=356&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fe4cd08c7abfffe9c5ee6023889a3dd7aff40dd4-1600x851.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fe4cd08c7abfffe9c5ee6023889a3dd7aff40dd4-1600x851.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fe4cd08c7abfffe9c5ee6023889a3dd7aff40dd4-1600x851.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fe4cd08c7abfffe9c5ee6023889a3dd7aff40dd4-1600x851.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fe4cd08c7abfffe9c5ee6023889a3dd7aff40dd4-1600x851.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Thank you to our Frame facilitators: Willy, Lizhi, Tahirih, Sho, Liam, Radhika, Greg, and Christa</figcaption></figure><p>To give you an idea of how this all comes to life, here are a few events and goings-on within each Frame:</p><ul><li><strong>Exploring:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willyvvu/">Willy</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lizhifan/">Lizhi</a> have organized a few tech talks to spark inspiration and give a nod to the iconic “blank slate” projects from the past: <em>Cowboy YOLO your dev cluster</em> by Lizhi herself and <em>Plug into Plugins</em> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackiechui/">Jackie</a>.</li><li><strong>Refining:</strong> Throughout the week, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tahirih-skolnik-2a135b103/">Tahirih</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shokuwamoto/">Sho</a> will host a series of brainstorming jams focused on small improvements that make a big difference for other Figmates, users, and our products.</li><li><strong>Learning: </strong>Figmates are intrinsically curious and creative, which is exactly what this Frame—facilitated by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/williamflahive/">Liam</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/radhikaparashar/">Radhika</a>—is about.

      <title>Shifting team culture at Config 2021</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/shifting-team-culture-at-config-2021/</link>
      <description>Some of our favorite moments from the conference</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Last month, over 40,000 of you attended <a href="https://config.figma.com/">Config 2021</a>, Figma’s two-day virtual design conference. Yesterday, we released 20 of the 40 breakout sessions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx68R0B8tettMfY6XeItWhV4">on YouTube</a> so you can catch the talks you missed (or re-watch your favorite speakers). Below, we’re sharing some of the highlights from the sessions on <a href="https://config.figma.com/tracks/shifting-team-culture/">shifting team culture</a>—the power of vulnerability, creating shared spaces, and why we can&#39;t do it alone.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="202ec2dc012e" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em><br/></em>As Figma CEO Dylan Field shared in the keynote, design is inherently collaborative, built on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=44&amp;v=v4g-oZ6mFIc&amp;feature=youtu.be">varied experiences and diverse perspectives</a>. An inclusive culture is key to opening up the design process to these experiences and perspectives, making more team members and collaborators feel welcome, and ultimately moving work forward. At Config 2021, we heard personal anecdotes and tactical tips from teams working to create a more collaborative reality. Here is a look at how they created cultures that foster transparency and trust.</p><h2 id="embracing-vulnerability"><a href="#embracing-vulnerability">Embracing vulnerability</a></h2><p>For many of us over the past year, the gap between work lives and personal lives narrowed. In her talk, Figma researcher <a href="https://config.figma.com/speakers/nannearl-brown/">Nannearl Brown</a> shares how she and the research team navigated a year full of hardship. For Nannearl, being open about how you’re feeling and what you need is the key to creating a supportive team culture. “Even when it’s hard,” she says, “I&#39;ve found that being honest is more worthwhile than not.”</p><p>In addition to checking in on each other in 1:1s and throughout the day, the team created a routine around daily stand-ups. In their shared Slack channel, each researcher shares a list of focus areas for the day. As part of their update, they’re prompted to talk about what they’re doing that day to give them energy beyond work—whether that’s exercise, a hobby or spending time with family. Nannearl says that it keeps the team accountable to do things outside of work, while allowing them to get to know each other better.</p><p>And, it all comes down to being a supportive teammate to one another: “It’s not enough to be present enough to listen to them–I also need to make space for their emotions, their experiences, and their thoughts.” Sometimes that means acknowledging the difficult moments. “We don&#39;t have to be okay all the time.”</p><h2 id="creating-inclusive-spaces"><a href="#creating-inclusive-spaces">Creating inclusive spaces</a></h2><p>For <a href="https://config.figma.com/speakers/johns-beharry/">Johns Beharry</a>, Bitcoin Designer at Peak Shift, and <a href="https://config.figma.com/speakers/christoph-ono/">Christoph Ono</a>, Bitcoin Designer at GBKS, shared tools and resources are central to building community. After hearing feedback from designers looking to enter the Bitcoin world, Johns and Christoph realized that Bitcoin design might be alienating to those without technical expertise. To Johns, this seemed contradictory to the ethos of Bitcoin, which he says is all about opening up access: “As Bitcoin&#39;s popularity continues to grow, it&#39;s essential that everyone&#39;s able to participate in this new economy, regardless of their technical expertise or geography, because people have a real need for it.”</p><p>To Johns and Christoph, the solution was all about creating shared spaces—starting with a <a href="https://bitcoindesign.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-gytq2snl-4TEWJOTKrXRCB4YLBoDunA#/">Slack group</a>—that allow designers new to the Bitcoin world to learn from more experienced designers. From there, it evolved across channels, from <a href="https://github.com/bitcoindesign">GitHub</a>, to a <a href="https://bitcoin.design/">resource hub</a>, to weekly community calls in which designers can share early work and discuss challenges. They also created the <a href="https://bitcoin.design/guide/">Bitcoin Design Guide</a>, an open source repository with learnings and best practices. Building an inclusive resource was top of mind—making it applicable across cultures, regions, geographies, and languages.</p><p>More than anything, says Johns, the goal was to create a “friendly space” that opens up the conversation and invites more diverse perspectives and backgrounds. “When we join with other people and add more people to the design process, we can get those other perspectives that can help us design more inclusive experiences and more accessible experiences,” says Johns. “We can’t do it alone.”</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="8b21e9179670" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em>Watch (or re-watch!) all of the talks from day one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx68R0B8tettMfY6XeItWhV4">here</a>.

      <title>Introducing branching: space to iterate and explore freely</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-branching-space-to-iterate-and-explore-freely/</link>
      <description>Announcing branching in beta</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Last week, at Config 2021, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/coming-together-at-config-2021/">we announced new ways</a> to bring your teammates together across the design process. Today, we’re introducing branching in beta to better enable collaboration at scale. Designers will have the space to iterate and explore freely, while preserving shared files as a single source of truth. Product Manager Meagan Gamache shares a peek into the 13-month journey to beta and what this means for design system management in Figma.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="0a723f18ebbc" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>As Figma CEO Dylan Field <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4g-oZ6mFIc">shared at Config</a>, design is never a solo act. Rather, it’s bringing together each individual’s unique skillsets—the sum of several efforts. That’s why we’re making it even easier for design teams to come together in Figma. With branching, designers can collaborate freely on shared files, while protecting them from unapproved or unintentional changes.</p><h2 id="the-good-problem"><a href="#the-good-problem">The (good) problem</a></h2><p>Like always, our journey to beta started with the needs of our users, who told us that their design systems were decentralized across multiple teams and platforms. The upside was that they were using design systems, instead of repeatedly building similar components from scratch. And, designers were able to reuse components and work faster and more efficiently. The downside was that these design systems were located in different places, resulting in inconsistencies and requiring designers to break flow between tools.</p><p>Design teams needed a way to centralize their design systems while protecting and maintaining them at scale. Let’s take the <a href="https://youtu.be/v4g-oZ6mFIc?t=224">Netflix Hawkins system</a>, for example. There are over 100 designers that both contribute to and rely on it. With that many contributors, the most recent updates to a file may not always be what’s approved for use. We needed to make space in the product for designers to be inspired and explore new ideas and iterations without auto-saving to shared files. So, we began thinking through ways to bring the branch-merge workflow into Figma.</p><h2 id="first-principles-first"><a href="#first-principles-first">First principles first</a></h2><p>We started by asking ourselves: How can we create a sandbox in Figma without creating more complexity for our users?</p><p>Commits felt like extra work. Branches of branches felt complex. So, we decided to revisit fundamental assumptions and take a renewed approach. We landed on two principles: simplicity and consistency. This meant branching needed to be built into the product holistically, prompting us to make branching work within the multiplayer experience. As a result, branches have all of the same multiplayer perks as other Figma files. There is no need for extra actions like committing, because the work on branches is auto-saved. Today, you can create a branch from any file to safely explore new ideas and, when ready, editors can merge updates into the main file.</p><figure></figure><p>As we continue to add features, like reviews, we’re also exploring how versioning works across the entire platform. In the spirit of simplicity and consistency, we want to give design teams one way of thinking about versioning that’s inclusive of both branching and multiplayer.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="eb43a1d87cf2" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Our team is excited to take this first step in incorporating branching into Figma, and enable our users to centralize design across the entire organization. Branching is now available in beta on our Organization plan, and teams are invited to <a href="https://forms.gle/yGTtBUJXdGRitVGw5">sign up to request access</a>. We will be adding users gradually, on an ongoing basis.</p><p>You are also invited to <a href="https://figma.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_tVIRLBcaTX6UOD1j6cxKtA">join us for a deep dive into branching</a>, where we will demo the feature and share ways to improve your workflows.

      <title>Introducing FigJam</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figjam/</link>
      <description>FigJam is an online whiteboard for teams to brainstorm and ideate together</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Today at Config 2021, our virtual design conference, Figma CEO Dylan Field announced the launch of <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam, Figma’s new whiteboarding space</a>. Available now in beta, FigJam is free for anyone for the rest of 2021. Below, Figma’s VP of Product Yuhki Yamashita shares a bit about why we decided to build FigJam.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="fecae8979dca" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>A lot has changed in the five or so years since Figma launched in closed beta, or as Dylan put it at the time: <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-meet-the-internet/">when design met the internet</a>.</p><p>A decades-long shift from the physical to the digital has accelerated. Design, once on the periphery, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-rise-of-ux-ui-design-a-decade-in-reflection/">has moved closer to center stage</a>. Collaboration is in; silos are out. And as if anyone needed reminding, many of us—me and my Figmates very much included—<a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/by-the-numbers-one-year-of-remote-work/">have been working remotely for over a year</a>.</p><p>What this all adds up to is less time spent together in person and more time spent in online spaces like Figma, which we’ve seen people use in all kinds of creative and unexpected ways—from <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/749261072790710247">multiplayer pong</a> to <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/781201547686744476">ice breakers</a> to <a href="https://twitter.com/tsantsai/status/1382010578655383554">meal planning</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/821550158119537264">brainstorming</a>.</p><p>In each of these use cases, pixels aren&#39;t being pushed. Products aren&#39;t being designed. People are simply looking for a space to share ideas and connect.</p><p>We can empathize—our team has been working from home, too. So it became clear to us early on, especially after what felt like our zillionth video call, that there’s something special about simply “being” in Figma together—that beyond a powerful interface design tool, Figma can serve as an <em>energizing</em> space for people across teams and geographies to come together, iterate and explore.</p><p>With this insight in hand, we kicked off an exploration of our own into whether we could make Figma a more inviting place for these types of free-form interactions. If we could do that, we figured, we could also bring more people into the earliest stages of design. After all, Figma’s vision is to make design accessible to everyone. Here was a chance to take the next step.</p><p>But after digging a bit further, we realized that these interactions needed their own dedicated space—one where anyone felt welcome and designers felt at home, so everyone could feel comfortable jumping in and sharing ideas.</p><h2 id="figjam-where-the-best-product-ideas-begin"><a href="#figjam-where-the-best-product-ideas-begin">FigJam: Where the best product ideas begin</a></h2><p>That’s why we built FigJam, an online whiteboard made for designers to ideate and brainstorm with their extended teams. Think of it as a lightweight version of Figma that’s easier to learn and even more fun to use. It’s for defining user problems, looking for inspiration, and exploring ideas.</p><p>There’s a ton of functionality built into FigJam that makes it a great space for early-stage design thinking. In multiplayer, teams can use sticky-notes, emojis and drawing tools to brainstorm. In single-player, systems thinkers can use shapes and pre-built lines and connectors to map user flows and build new processes.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?rect=0,0,1599,907&amp;w=670&amp;h=380&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a67bc77d9695229a5228c3c9272953d4a6befd47-1600x907.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Diagramming in FigJam is easy with shapes and pre-built lines and connectors. And with stamps and cursor chats, emoting and reacting is simple and fun. </figcaption></figure><p>FigJam is also designed to be a one-stop-shop for easy collaboration. Built-in audio functionality makes it easy for teams to “talk it out” without having to pick up the phone or start a video call. And unlike other options, FigJam works seamlessly with Figma, so teams can keep all their design work—from initial concept to final prototype—all in the same place.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dfd9dfa0148699cf2b5bb4fb035564ae303fe762-1600x907.jpg?rect=0,0,1599,907&amp;w=670&amp;h=380&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dfd9dfa0148699cf2b5bb4fb035564ae303fe762-1600x907.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dfd9dfa0148699cf2b5bb4fb035564ae303fe762-1600x907.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dfd9dfa0148699cf2b5bb4fb035564ae303fe762-1600x907.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dfd9dfa0148699cf2b5bb4fb035564ae303fe762-1600x907.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dfd9dfa0148699cf2b5bb4fb035564ae303fe762-1600x907.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Teams can use sticky-notes, emojis and drawing tools to brainstorm in FigJam. And built-in audio functionality makes it easy to “talk it out” live.</figcaption></figure><p>We also wanted to bring the same warmth and serendipity that people love about Figma to FigJam, whether you’re ideating, ice-breaking, or just “hanging out.” Cursor chats, emojis, stamps, and other carefully designed features allow you to express yourself fully.</p><p>Put another way, in FigJam fun meets functionality.</p><p>That’s one reason why teams at <strong>Stripe, Netflix, Salesforce, Twitch</strong> and more have used FigJam over the past few months to brainstorm and ideate. Their feedback, the good and the bad, has not only been essential to our team; it has also affirmed that FigJam fills a deep user need.</p><p>Here’s how Discord’s Head of Design, Kevin Wilson, described it:</p><div><blockquote><p>“FigJam has been awesome for the Discord product design team because it is so much like Figma itself—but a focused, uncomplicated version that works great for a brainstorm or a retrospective, or anything really.”</p></blockquote></div><p>In 2022, FigJam will have both free and paid plans ($8 and $15 per editor/month), but until then—for the rest of 2021—anyone, anywhere can use FigJam for free.</p><p>We hope you’ll <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">check out FigJam</a>, and if you do, <a href="https://forum.figma.com/figjam">let us know what you think</a>. Because our goal isn’t only to make FigJam a place where the best product ideas begin, but to make Figma the best home for designers and their teams to come together <em>and</em> build together—from start to finish, end to end.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Coming together at Config 2021</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/coming-together-at-config-2021/</link>
      <description>Everything we announced at Config 2021</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nothing great is made alone. Our teams, collaborators, and thought partners are instrumental in shaping a good idea into a great one. This year, more than ever, we’ve learned that the best ideas come from tapping into the power of varied experiences and diverse perspectives.</p><p>For a long time, togetherness wasn’t the norm in design. When we <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-meet-the-internet/">first launched Figma</a>, people thought design was a solo act. Teams opened up over time, particularly over this past year, as entire organizations—designers and non-designers alike—sought out digital spaces, like Figma, to be together.</p><p>Today, at Config 2021, we announced new ways to bring you and your teammates together at different stages of design, while also enabling more people to meaningfully contribute to the process:<br/></p><ul><li><strong>FigJam</strong>, a new whiteboard space for teams to ideate and brainstorm</li><li><strong>Branching</strong>, a new workflow that enables others to contribute to your design system</li><li><strong>A new mobile app</strong>, an easier way for stakeholders to view designs from anywhere</li><li><strong>Audio</strong>, a new channel to converse with teammates while iterating on designs</li><li><strong>Higher user limits</strong>, so 500+ of your design friends can come together in Figma</li><li>And <strong>publishing to the Figma Community</strong> for everyone!</li></ul><h2 id="explore-more-ideas-together-with-figjam"><a href="#explore-more-ideas-together-with-figjam">Explore more ideas together with FigJam</a></h2><p>From day one, we’ve seen our community push Figma beyond interface design. Figma has become an open canvas for teams to use however—and for whatever—they need. However, as a general design tool, Figma was not designed to be intuitive for all these use cases. That’s why today we’re announcing <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">FigJam, a new whiteboard space</a> purpose-built for you to brainstorm ideas, diagram user journeys, and more.</p><p>As you explore FigJam, you’ll find some unique features to express yourself. Since so many of us have moved from physical to digital spaces, we wanted to bring some of the serendipity and warmth of in-person interactions into the FigJam canvas. With emotes, chats, and more, we’re excited to create a space where teams can be themselves, together.</p><figure></figure><p>Released today in open beta, FigJam is free until February, 2022. In 2022, FigJam will have both free and paid plans ($8 and $15 per editor/month). Roll-out begins at 9am PT on April 21 and it’ll be available to all users by the end of the day. We want to build FigJam with our community—we hope that you <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">check it out</a> and can&#39;t wait to <a href="https://forum.figma.com/figjam">hear what you think</a>!</p><h2 id="iterate-thoughtfully-with-branching"><a href="#iterate-thoughtfully-with-branching">Iterate thoughtfully with branching</a></h2><p>To better enable teams to collaborate as they grow and scale, we’re introducing branching to Figma. When inspiration strikes, you can now branch a file to provide yourself a breakout space to riff. Like everything in Figma, you can collaborate with others in the branch using multiplayer. Finished? With just a few clicks, you can update the main branch with a simple merge.</p><figure></figure><p>From empowering more teammates to contribute to your design system to enabling a safe space to explore variations, branching gives teams—especially large ones—a way to iterate together. Available in beta, branching is a feature on our Organization plan. To learn more about branching permissions and workflows, <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360063144053-Create-branches-and-merge-changes">check out this article</a>.</p><h2 id="figma-at-your-fingertips-with-our-new-mobile-app"><a href="#figma-at-your-fingertips-with-our-new-mobile-app">Figma at your fingertips with our new mobile app</a></h2><p>Many of our users are designing state of the art apps in Figma and need a way to see how their designs look and feel on an actual device. But beyond that, we also want to give you more ways to share your work—to bring others along and involve them from wherever they might be.</p><figure></figure><p>The all new mobile app for iOS and Android is now in beta and will be released to everyone soon. Along with a more stable mirrored playback experience, files and prototypes are now easier than ever to access and view from anywhere. <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500007537281">Visit this article</a> for more information on our mobile app beta and upcoming launch.</p><h2 id="talk-it-out-with-audio"><a href="#talk-it-out-with-audio">Talk it out with audio</a></h2><p>Sometimes it’s helpful to talk through changes live. With audio, you can start a call instantly in the editor and easily invite your colleagues to join you. Whether it’s doing a design critique live in a Figma file or holding a group brainstorm in FigJam, you can talk it out directly in the editor.</p><figure></figure><p>Coming soon, audio will be available to users on our Professional and Organization plans. You can <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfExhyCueAZXYmzfMG5U7weygOuV9WBJudx4naSNgSCiDyFAA/viewform">sign up here</a> to be notified when it’s available.</p><h2 id="_500-users"><a href="#_500-users">500+ users</a></h2><p>In addition to creating new ways for different users to contribute, we’re raising the multiplayer limit to 500 concurrent users (100 editors and 400 viewers) in Figma today. And in a few weeks, we’ll be pushing that to 1,000 concurrent users (200 editors and 800 viewers) in both Figma and FigJam.</p><figure></figure><p>While we’re increasing these limits to support use cases like large scale design presentations, workshops, and classroom activities, we’re excited to see how they might open up new, different use cases we haven’t seen before in the design space. To learn more about our expanded user limits, <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500006775761">check out this article</a>.</p><p>Last but definitely not least, we are opening the Figma Community so everyone can publish now. Not only can you access files created from other users, like the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/figjam">new FigJam templates</a>, you can share your work, a helpful template, or a cool trick with the world.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a71b2e5538d305019b06e0f785fabb1dda35df5a-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a71b2e5538d305019b06e0f785fabb1dda35df5a-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a71b2e5538d305019b06e0f785fabb1dda35df5a-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a71b2e5538d305019b06e0f785fabb1dda35df5a-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a71b2e5538d305019b06e0f785fabb1dda35df5a-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a71b2e5538d305019b06e0f785fabb1dda35df5a-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="603a44068db7" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We can’t wait for you to try out these new updates and spaces to brainstorm, design, and build.

      <title>How Repsol rethinks the way the world interacts with energy</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-repsol-rethinks-the-way-the-world-interacts-with-energy/</link>
      <description>Repsol, Spain&#39;s largest multi-energy company, set out to unify their designs in Figma while making energy more approachable to consumers.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a world of climate change, many are focusing on how energy is created and consumed. Repsol, Spain’s largest multi-energy company, was the first company of its kind to commit to being carbon zero by 2050. Design was central to this shift.</p><p>&#34;Design helps us create digital products adapted to the needs of our clients and employees. The impact is not in making things more beautiful, but in enabling Repsol to stay relevant and to fulfill the needs and expectations of our clients.&#34; says Valero Marin, CIO/CDO.</p><p>Three years ago, Repsol didn’t have a digital design team. Today, ten designers work to redefine how customers and consumers interact with energy, and they’re one of the first internal design teams at any European energy company. For these designers to be successful, the Repsol team needed to define the role design can play at Repsol and build the teams, tools, and processes necessary to make design scale.</p><p>Repsol partnered with Mendesaltaren, a digital product agency, to implement a design system in Figma. The result is not only a more collaborative and consistent approach to design, but also a measurable one. With this backdrop, designers at Repsol have begun to make energy more approachable for consumers.</p><p>“As designers at Repsol, our role is to move everyone into a new reality where energy is tangible and relatable,” says Cristina Gonzalez Bermejo, Lead UX &amp; Design Hub, at Repsol.</p><h2 id="rethinking-how-consumers-interact-with-energy"><a href="#rethinking-how-consumers-interact-with-energy">Rethinking how consumers interact with energy</a></h2><p><br/>Once executives at Repsol made a promise to reach zero emissions by 2050, the work began immediately. As part of this shift, Repsol knew that the average consumer doesn’t have a deep understanding of how energy is created or consumed. It begged the question: how do you design for something that no one has actually interacted with before?</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23610c057354a2629552272922d5c6a9637fea78-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Repsol’s updated designs that make energy more approachable to consumers</figcaption></figure><p>“The energy transition will only happen if people stop seeing energy as a necessary evil, and start seeing themselves as change agents,” Cristina says. “In that context, the role of design is key.”</p><p>The mission of Repsol’s design team is to humanize energy, make people care about it, and help individuals dedicate time to understanding how they can better consume energy. Recently, the team designed an app for an electric car-sharing service that shows consumers how much energy they use when they’re driving. Customers then received a rating based on how they drive, helping them understand how to drive more efficiently.</p><p>The team also wants to help make energy into something visual and relatable, so design is top of mind. The design team recently added functionality that shows where energy originates. In the app, a user can see in real-time the solar panels or windmills that generate their electricity, in context of the current weather conditions. In the past, a user would simply get a bill. Now they have the opportunity to visualize and interact with their energy.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?rect=0,0,2560,1437&amp;w=670&amp;h=376&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fdedf8a8c2434f2a8b10f60078e30b3f70144c6d-2560x1438.gif?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The app where consumers can select the source of their electricity and see live the conditions under which it is being generated</figcaption></figure><h2 id="a-solid-foundation"><a href="#a-solid-foundation">A solid foundation</a></h2><p>Repsol serves many different audiences: those at the gas pump, workers making energy decisions for a factory, and its own employees who use digital tools to make the operation of oil rigs, refineries, or supply chains safer and more efficient. “But,” as Cristina says, “there’s one Repsol, so there should be one unique design system.”</p><p>Design Strategist Andra Oprișan echoes that sentiment. “We realized that we were teaching users ten different interaction languages in ten different products.” Beyond simplifying the process, they needed to make it easier for people to adopt the tools they create. By partnering with Mendesaltaren and Figma, the team at Repsol built the Oxygen design system. In doing so, they cracked the code on creating one design experience for different products that serve different purposes for different audiences.</p><p>The main goal of Repsol’s Oxygen design system—which is built in Figma—is to create cohesion across the Repsol digital product ecosystem, while also making the product development process more efficient. Comprised of patterns, components, interaction design guidelines, and developer guidelines, it acts as the bridge between the technology team and design team.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d96c50bee399cba5d72356cd6039df257fa18961-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d96c50bee399cba5d72356cd6039df257fa18961-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d96c50bee399cba5d72356cd6039df257fa18961-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d96c50bee399cba5d72356cd6039df257fa18961-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d96c50bee399cba5d72356cd6039df257fa18961-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d96c50bee399cba5d72356cd6039df257fa18961-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Repsol’s Oxygen design system</figcaption></figure><p>Today, Figma sits at the center of all Repsol design projects and communications, from collaborating with peers to sharing work with the C-suite.

      <description>Changes to our Starter plan</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Starter plan updates rolled out on April 21, 2021. In addition to the below changes, we’re <a href="https://www.figma.com/figjam/">introducing FigJam</a> to all plans! During the beta period, users can enjoy unlimited usage. Next year, we’ll introduce both free and paid plans for FigJam.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="765dd2ed30e9" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We all know that design is never a solo act—there are always reviewers, clients, or teammates of some kind. That’s why we built <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/meet-us-in-the-browser/">Figma in the browser</a>, which is what makes it inherently more collaborative than other design technology. In fact, that’s what leads many teams to Figma. But <em>knowing</em> about the power of better collaboration and actually <em>experiencing</em> it are two different things.</p><p>Collaboration is more than just sharing assets. It’s working together in real-time. For many new users—skeptics and enthusiasts alike—the free Starter plan is their entry point to Figma and their first experience with multiplayer.</p><p>But since we launched the Starter plan as part of our <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-meet-the-internet/">closed beta in 2015</a>, we realized that the plan, with its two-editor limit, didn’t let teams experience the full potential of multiplayer.</p><p>Before we share more insight into why we’re updating the plan, let’s recap what’s actually changing.</p><h2 id="changes-to-figma-s-free-starter-plan"><a href="#changes-to-figma-s-free-starter-plan">Changes to Figma’s free Starter plan</a></h2><p>Drafts is becoming a personal space for work. In drafts, you’ll still have unlimited files, pages, and viewers. However, if you want to co-edit with others, you have to move the file to a team space.</p><p>In the team space, we’re removing the two-editor limit, which means you&#39;ll now be able to collaborate more freely with unlimited editors. In order to introduce unlimited editors for free, we&#39;ll be adding a new maximum of three files in the team space. Each file will have a cap of three pages.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57e0d636938378aec33dd01fb90b8f53669368a4-1650x906.png?w=670&amp;h=368&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57e0d636938378aec33dd01fb90b8f53669368a4-1650x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57e0d636938378aec33dd01fb90b8f53669368a4-1650x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57e0d636938378aec33dd01fb90b8f53669368a4-1650x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57e0d636938378aec33dd01fb90b8f53669368a4-1650x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57e0d636938378aec33dd01fb90b8f53669368a4-1650x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="the-why-behind-these-changes"><a href="#the-why-behind-these-changes">The “why” behind these changes</a></h2><p>To unlock the full potential of multiplayer, we needed to unlock the two-editor cap. We considered other options, like doubling the editor limit, but we realized that <em>any</em> limit would be arbitrary—especially as we continue to build more products for teams.</p><p>Every team and designer is different. Some want to work with one other collaborator, while others need to share with fifty teammates. Any team, regardless of size, should be able to try Figma’s Starter plan and experience multiplayer firsthand.</p><p>To make sure that this new proposed plan would work, we tested it with thousands of new and existing users around the world. Here is what we learned:</p><ul><li>87% of users expressed excitement with the change to unlimited editors in the team space</li><li>Teams saw a 29% increase in collaboration without the two-editor limit</li><li>Users typically only actively collaborate on 2-3 files at a time, so the new file and pages limits in the team space felt reasonable, since unlimited files were still available in drafts</li></ul><h2 id="what-you-can-expect"><a href="#what-you-can-expect">What you can expect</a></h2><p>We are rolling out the new Starter plan on April 21, 2021. All existing files, pages, and projects created before then will not be moved, changed, or impacted. Over the coming weeks, we’ll continue giving our Starter users a heads-up both via email and in the Figma app.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="b97941721da2" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>As always, we build our product based on user feedback. And improving our free Starter plan is just as important as any feature we build—it’s central to making design accessible to all.

      <description>What it took to build and ship a (seemingly) simple user request</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Today, we’re launching account switcher, streamlining the experience of navigating across different accounts and workspaces in Figma, while still unifying your work under one single profile in the Figma Community. Product Manager <a href="https://twitter.com/benstern0">Ben Stern</a> shares how delivering on a seemingly simple user request required navigating a surprising amount of complexity: the technical foundation, design explorations, and building towards a new north star, while solving for short-term needs.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="CbRxVOnTHYWz" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>While Figma is most often used for designing and prototyping, we’ve long used it internally for everything from <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-tips-from-the-team-that-builds-figma/#getting-into-a-state-of-flow">brainstorming creative concepts</a> to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-case-for-lightweight-prototyping/#communicating-at-figma-in-figma">building slide decks</a>. Increasingly, we observed users relying on Figma for so much outside of product design, like <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90494579/while-stuck-at-home-this-vc-built-a-virtual-version-of-silicon-valley">creating digital maps</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.gallery/">developing vector artwork</a>, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/digital-designers-take-professional-collaboration-tools-and-riff-on-them-11616580001">planning a wedding</a>, and even <a href="https://twitter.com/bonniekatewolf/status/1338532050534481920?s=20">making fan art</a>. Figma has become a home for projects at work, and a space to create outside company walls.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60f2825d3c2faba456752fab4d93e00ca57ce380-1980x2388.png?w=670&amp;h=808&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60f2825d3c2faba456752fab4d93e00ca57ce380-1980x2388.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60f2825d3c2faba456752fab4d93e00ca57ce380-1980x2388.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60f2825d3c2faba456752fab4d93e00ca57ce380-1980x2388.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60f2825d3c2faba456752fab4d93e00ca57ce380-1980x2388.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60f2825d3c2faba456752fab4d93e00ca57ce380-1980x2388.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Art from Figma Community member Dinara Nikolaeva</figcaption></figure><p>So, when Director of Product Sho Kuwamoto <a href="https://twitter.com/skuwamoto/status/1242516046759620613?s=20">asked users on Twitter</a> what they’d like us to add or change in Figma, it was no surprise that support for multiple Figma accounts was top of the list.</p><h2 id="a-new-paradigm"><a href="#a-new-paradigm">A new paradigm</a></h2><p>As we scoped this feature, we knew that user feedback would be a driving force. More than anything, we heard that <a href="https://twitter.com/elishaterada/status/1352033344666574848">users have many roles</a>—employee, freelancer, hobbyist—but no simple way to move between these different identities. Instead of <a href="https://twitter.com/amanfromsolan/status/1352229816490070019">resorting to complex workarounds</a>, they needed to easily switch between workspaces, depending on whether they were creating designs at work or during off hours. </p><p>And <em>creating</em> work has different requirements than <em>sharing</em> work. While users need to move freely between accounts as they’re designing, they also need to have choices around how that work is packaged and attributed. Many Figma users maintain a public profile in the Figma Community, sharing their work, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-figma-community-comments/">managing comments</a>, and connecting with others under <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-community/">one handle</a>. Keeping personal files separate from work projects is important, and equally critical is allowing users to maintain one public brand as they change jobs or roles.</p><h3 id="rethinking-the-1-1-model"><a href="#rethinking-the-1-1-model">Rethinking the 1:1 model</a></h3><p>Among the many things that the enterprise team is tasked with, authentication—the concept of recognizing and verifying a user’s credentials—is top of the list. Authentication is usually synonymous with <em>security</em>, but it also ties to <em>identity</em>. Most product assume a 1:1 model, that one user equates to one account. Companies like Slack, Google, and Instagram ultimately supported multiple accounts as user needs evolved, but they started with one account at launch.</p><p>Since the Figma editor is the hub for creation, and the Figma Community is the home for publishing work, we needed to consider both spaces. While we’d want to allow toggling between separate accounts in the Figma editor, in the Figma Community, it would be important to unify all accounts under one profile. What complicates this even more is ensuring that work projects respect the walls of a company, while still allowing for easy access and switching between personal projects. </p><p>Our goal was to help people work in Figma in a way that reflects all the facets of their work—both inside a company and outside of it. It was time to move away from the paradigm of one person per Figma account and make switching between contexts easier and intuitive. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df5d822895f8d53ffcb2012b7bfd922cc232f50-5000x2658.png?rect=0,0,5000,2657&amp;w=670&amp;h=356&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df5d822895f8d53ffcb2012b7bfd922cc232f50-5000x2658.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df5d822895f8d53ffcb2012b7bfd922cc232f50-5000x2658.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df5d822895f8d53ffcb2012b7bfd922cc232f50-5000x2658.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df5d822895f8d53ffcb2012b7bfd922cc232f50-5000x2658.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df5d822895f8d53ffcb2012b7bfd922cc232f50-5000x2658.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Some early explorations on how to indicate where a new file would be created and what this experience would look like in our desktop app</figcaption></figure><h2 id="designing-towards-a-north-star"><a href="#designing-towards-a-north-star">Designing towards a north star</a></h2><p>With this in mind, we started designing. But once we actually mapped out what this new paradigm might look like, we quickly realized that the “one user, one account” model was baked into the file browser UI, not just the technical infrastructure. If we were to add on support for multiple accounts based on the previous version of the file browser, the UI would be clunky, at best—not to mention the broader under-the-hood technical challenges. To accommodate a new account switching feature, we’d have to re-examine the whole information architecture (IA) of the file browser.</p><p>So, we needed to arrive on a long-term direction of the file browser, while also making changes to address user feedback in the short-term. Our new north star? A hybrid model, allowing users to access multiple workspaces in the Figma editor, while maintaining one single Figma Community profile.</p><p>As we thought about how to build this, we needed to be conscious of what it looks and feels like to go from one single identity (the Figma Community) to multiple identities (the Figma editor). We would have to make the Figma Community feel separate enough from the Figma editor, while still being cohesive from a design perspective.</p><p>UX considerations were top of mind:</p><ul><li><strong>Managing tabs:</strong> We didn’t want users to have to close and reopen their tabs each time they switched between accounts. Instead, we made it possible to keep tabs from <em>different</em> accounts open at the same time, in the same window. To make it clear which account is open in a given tab, we added an icon in the center of the editor that shows which account the file belongs to.</li><li><strong>Installing plugins:</strong> We heard from users that they want to access all installed plugins, even when signed into multiple accounts. Now, if a user has multiple Figma accounts connected to one profile in the Figma Community, clicking “install” adds the plugin to all connected accounts.</li><li><strong>Naming workspaces:</strong> Previously, accounts outside of an org account were called “Personal” spaces. After hearing user feedback via our support team, we realized that this was a misnomer since work in this space was still tied to a work email address. We renamed the space “External teams.”</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1d6c1d7849b36b327d3f23bfc3784e4469c0755-1600x654.png?rect=0,0,1599,654&amp;w=670&amp;h=274&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1d6c1d7849b36b327d3f23bfc3784e4469c0755-1600x654.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1d6c1d7849b36b327d3f23bfc3784e4469c0755-1600x654.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1d6c1d7849b36b327d3f23bfc3784e4469c0755-1600x654.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1d6c1d7849b36b327d3f23bfc3784e4469c0755-1600x654.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1d6c1d7849b36b327d3f23bfc3784e4469c0755-1600x654.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Early explorations of the menu with feedback and notes from the team</figcaption></figure><h2 id="embracing-hard-problems"><a href="#embracing-hard-problems">Embracing hard problems</a></h2><p>Whenever we see a commonly requested feature, our instinct is to ship it as soon as possible.

In many ways, the easy answer would be to ship an MVP in response to user feedback. But knowing that our ideal state would disrupt the file browser IA, it was important to get it right. While getting it right took longer, it also allowed us to think more holistically about the user experience—landing on a solution that solves immediate needs, while leaving room to scale with Figma as our products evolve. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="1hLeK4MXpbTM" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Check out the new account switcher feature in Figma and get more tips in <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500005165741">this help center article</a>.

      <description>How the team at Tailwind Labs created a set of fully responsive components</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>David Luhr, Lead Developer at Tailwind Labs, shares how the team created a Figma kit for Tailwind UI, a set of fully responsive components that helps designers and developers collaborate more efficiently. Here, he shares what he learned—from organizing the project, to getting customer feedback, to the small polish details that made all the difference. Today, a starter pack of the kit is <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/958381589801778722">live on the Figma Community</a>.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="x8Rsq6_omjlV" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Tailwind UI is a collection of thoughtfully crafted, fully responsive HTML components built with Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework.</p><p>Since <a href="https://tailwindui.com/">Tailwind UI</a> launched in early access in spring 2020, customers have asked almost daily if and when Figma files would be available. By the fall, demand from customers became overwhelming, and I set out to create the official Figma kit for Tailwind UI. With over 400 fully-responsive code components, Tailwind UI&#39;s surface area rivals most design systems, so I had quite the challenge ahead of me.</p><p>For much of the next few months, I&#39;d be heads down in Figma, building (and even rebuilding) over 1,400 components and 10,000 distinct elements, all while keeping quality and usability top of mind. Here&#39;s what I learned.</p><h2 id="attention-to-detail-at-every-level-of-a-design"><a href="#attention-to-detail-at-every-level-of-a-design">Attention to detail at every level of a design system</a></h2><p>Building a commercial design kit requires the utmost attention to detail. This is in contrast to working files for designing new products and features, which are often messy, temporary, unpredictable workspaces whose sole purpose is to unlock new ideas and solutions as efficiently as possible.</p><p>When the design files are the final product, decisions at every scale define the user experience—from layer names to component structure to page layout. To build the best Figma kit possible, we had to flip the typical workflow, and have the final code product inform the design files as a pixel-perfect standard to match. Maintaining high quality at every level of a design system was our north star.</p><h3 id="naming-layers"><a href="#naming-layers">Naming layers</a></h3><p>Let&#39;s start with layers themselves. I established naming conventions and labeled everything accordingly, making sure I was staying consistent throughout. In Figma, consistent naming also allows for overrides to carry over when swapping instances or changing variants of a component. For example, a &#34;button&#34; component has a simple text layer named &#34;Text.&#34; If I change my button to a larger size variant, the custom text I create carries over. With more complex components, this saves a lot of time for users, who might customize icons, headings, paragraphs, link text, and more, then decide to swap their component for a different variation.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/27104debcc96b5690b04350a8356d31268e6f008-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;h=378&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/27104debcc96b5690b04350a8356d31268e6f008-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/27104debcc96b5690b04350a8356d31268e6f008-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/27104debcc96b5690b04350a8356d31268e6f008-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/27104debcc96b5690b04350a8356d31268e6f008-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/27104debcc96b5690b04350a8356d31268e6f008-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Layer naming in button variations</figcaption></figure><h3 id="organizing-layers"><a href="#organizing-layers">Organizing layers</a></h3><p>Now, how to organize these layers? With the latest auto layout features, combined with layout grids and layout constraints, you can create layers that mimic HTML markup pretty well. While I&#39;d love an option to stack Figma&#39;s layers bottom-to-top to further match the stacking context of the web, you can get a good approximation. This is worth it for a couple reasons: there&#39;s shared understanding between designers and developers around what&#39;s possible in terms of layout in the browser, and there&#39;s similar architecture for customers to navigate in both design and code versions.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f80c83622749fbfa295d56e3a13b402d11b699ab-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;h=378&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f80c83622749fbfa295d56e3a13b402d11b699ab-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f80c83622749fbfa295d56e3a13b402d11b699ab-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f80c83622749fbfa295d56e3a13b402d11b699ab-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f80c83622749fbfa295d56e3a13b402d11b699ab-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f80c83622749fbfa295d56e3a13b402d11b699ab-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Layer structure in a complex component</figcaption></figure><p>This also reveals opportunities to document patterns that otherwise might go unnoticed. For example, many components in Tailwind UI have consistent responsive padding and a centered, max-width container. By creating design file layers that match what&#39;s needed in HTML markup, developers can see this consistency and create a dedicated container to handle these repeated layout rules.</p><h3 id="crafting-variants"><a href="#crafting-variants">Crafting variants</a></h3><p>With well-structured components, variants can vastly simplify design systems and make components much more adaptable.</p><p>Instead of manually maintaining and arranging a collection of 80 unique badge components, for example, I created a single Badge with convenient variants for type, size, theme, and some optional secondary elements. While it takes some upfront work to create these variants, it makes the final component much simpler and more adaptable for users. Customers can drop in a single badge and quickly adapt it to their needs with an intuitive set of options.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f2ad27df439950d0a69acbacaff3bcbde8e4d66-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;h=378&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f2ad27df439950d0a69acbacaff3bcbde8e4d66-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f2ad27df439950d0a69acbacaff3bcbde8e4d66-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f2ad27df439950d0a69acbacaff3bcbde8e4d66-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f2ad27df439950d0a69acbacaff3bcbde8e4d66-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f2ad27df439950d0a69acbacaff3bcbde8e4d66-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Badge component with 80 unique variants</figcaption></figure><p>When creating variants, it’s important that the same properties a developer might provide with a code component exist on a component in Figma, using the same terminology. Again, consistent naming conventions and structure for variants provide a predictable experience for design kit users. When building <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/958381589801778722">Tailwind UI&#39;s Figma kit</a>, I found that across hundreds of final components, I could use the same variant names for the vast majority: type, size, theme, position, breakpoint, and state.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0fc272ac67ae5bc2fdfac115a2cf4944ce89fa55-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;h=378&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0fc272ac67ae5bc2fdfac115a2cf4944ce89fa55-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0fc272ac67ae5bc2fdfac115a2cf4944ce89fa55-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0fc272ac67ae5bc2fdfac115a2cf4944ce89fa55-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0fc272ac67ae5bc2fdfac115a2cf4944ce89fa55-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0fc272ac67ae5bc2fdfac115a2cf4944ce89fa55-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Variants for a complex component</figcaption></figure><p>Variants are essentially self-documenting. Anyone can look at a component, see the distinct variations and how they map to settings in the variants panel. And wow, do they keep the final component count slimmed down. When the Tailwind UI Figma kit was complete, we had 1,430 components, with an average of seven variants. Without variants, this would be more than 10,000 components. Since we wanted to focus the kit on the final components found on the website, variants helped us keep the component count down much closer to the 400 or so code components that customers will be using in their work.</p><h3 id="auditing-components-for-pixel-perfection"><a href="#auditing-components-for-pixel-perfection">Auditing components for pixel perfection</a></h3><p>If you&#39;re recreating existing components or UIs, I highly recommend using screenshot overlays to speed up and improve the accuracy of your work.</p><p>When I mentioned pixel-perfect earlier, I wasn&#39;t saying that lightly. As I built each component in Tailwind UI&#39;s Figma kit, I made heavy use of the Dev Tools&#39; &#34;Screenshot Node&#34; feature to create images that I overlaid with 50% opacity on top of my designs in Figma. This helped me double check my work at every level, and even revealed a few inconsistencies in our code components that we later fixed. More on that feedback loop later.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7f57c1df81aa91a8c5172ffb7d7da69b1b7ce39-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;h=378&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7f57c1df81aa91a8c5172ffb7d7da69b1b7ce39-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7f57c1df81aa91a8c5172ffb7d7da69b1b7ce39-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7f57c1df81aa91a8c5172ffb7d7da69b1b7ce39-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7f57c1df81aa91a8c5172ffb7d7da69b1b7ce39-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7f57c1df81aa91a8c5172ffb7d7da69b1b7ce39-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Overlaying Figma components with a browser screenshot</figcaption></figure><h3 id="designing-a-showroom"><a href="#designing-a-showroom">Designing a showroom</a></h3><p>Code components on the website are each displayed in a responsive preview that users can adjust to see how each component adapts across Tailwind CSS&#39;s defined breakpoints. This creates a sort of showroom—allowing users to see each component in context—which we wanted to recreate in the Figma kit.</p><p>To do this, I built every component at a mobile and desktop breakpoint, while making them as flexible as possible with auto layout and layout grids.</p><p>To further replicate the website&#39;s user experience, each page of the Figma kit matches a page on the website. Every page has a dedicated heading that links to the corresponding page on the website. A page contains only the final components, complete with example backgrounds to show the component in context with the intended viewport size. These example backgrounds are components themselves, and are kept tidy in a locked group layer at the very bottom of the layer list. This allows users to instantly select the components without the example backgrounds, so they can quickly copy/paste them for their own use.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0a5afaf063bd18796dc2a5df8ea71e4cc18b0f17-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;h=378&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0a5afaf063bd18796dc2a5df8ea71e4cc18b0f17-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0a5afaf063bd18796dc2a5df8ea71e4cc18b0f17-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0a5afaf063bd18796dc2a5df8ea71e4cc18b0f17-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0a5afaf063bd18796dc2a5df8ea71e4cc18b0f17-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0a5afaf063bd18796dc2a5df8ea71e4cc18b0f17-1606x906.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Example background components in a locked layer group</figcaption></figure><p>When the design files are a product in their own right, these little details of polish and consistency in how you present components go a long way.</p><h3 id="creating-a-parts-inventory"><a href="#creating-a-parts-inventory">Creating a parts inventory</a></h3><p>With only the final components on each page, where do all the granular, building-block components go? To keep the main pages clean and focused, I created a dedicated “Parts” page that&#39;s home to every component outside of the &#34;showroom&#34; pages. The Parts page can grow to be a behemoth, but it&#39;s easy to maintain with auto layout layers and dedicated headings that back link to the respective pages in the kit. The majority of the time, users will reach for a final component and never need to look at the Parts page, but those who want to dig deeper have a complete inventory of well-organized components they can peruse and adapt to their own use cases.</p><h2 id="how-to-structure-a-design-system-project"><a href="#how-to-structure-a-design-system-project">How to structure a design system project</a></h2><p>Beyond the more granular decisions of layers, components, and pages, we learned how to best sequence a project of this scale, when to rethink our approach, and how to engage customers along the way.</p><p>Here are our main takeaways:</p><ul><li><strong>Start with the foundations.</strong> Build the most granular components—buttons, dropdowns, badges, and avatars—first. These can be immediately reused to create more complex components like styles and colors.</li><li><strong>Next, tackle the tough challenges.</strong> From there, start on whatever seems the most difficult, tedious, or unknown, with the goal of reducing risk upfront. In our case, that was tricky tables, intricate description lists, and elaborate marketing sections. Doing so will reveal how to build even the most complicated components as early as possible, which makes the rest of the project more efficient (and less stressful). You’ll also be able to commit to naming conventions, layout approaches, and overall organization at the outset, knowing that they’ll apply to all situations.</li><li><strong>Polish as you go.</strong> Finalizing each component and page along the way makes for calm, easy, and quick launch prep once the full design system is ready, with no flurry of QA needed. In fact, on February 16, after several months of work, I completed the final component in the Tailwind UI Figma kit at 10 AM, and we were able to officially <a href="https://twitter.com/tailwindcss/status/1361797146744393731">announce and launch the kit</a>, ready for download, just four hours later.</li><li><strong>Know when to rebuild.</strong> If things aren’t up to standards, a naming convention isn’t scaling, or a major new Figma feature launches, don’t be afraid to start over. It’ll be faster to build on a second pass, and the design system will be more resilient and easier to maintain. With the Tailwind UI Figma kit, we decided to completely redo months of work when the new auto layout features and variants landed in November 2020. By starting fresh, our customers have the best possible kit to use in their work.</li><li><strong>Involve users along the way.</strong> Look for opportunities to share your work. Provide preview files to users for feedback on things like component features, naming conventions, or page organization and share your work to drum up excitement. To help with the overwhelming demand, we provided a number of preview releases to existing customers to gain valuable feedback, and I did multiple <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qIKkJdR7uM&amp;list=PLKFUh46KjXES8fEhnlmtGZvRi_V-OInaz">livestreams of showing my process</a> for building the Figma kit so anyone could learn from our approach.</li><li><strong>Give back to the community.</strong> While Tailwind UI is a paid product, we’re heavily involved in open source and wanted to create value for customers and non-customers alike. As a thank you to the community, we created Figma Community files to help the design community kick off a new project with Tailwind CSS styles, as well as a free preview set of Tailwind UI components to explore and use.</li></ul><h2 id="the-feedback-loop"><a href="#the-feedback-loop">The feedback loop</a></h2><p>This project was rooted in designing components from existing code, which provided an interesting feedback loop. Originally, every Tailwind UI component began life in Figma with initial designs. Then, those were developed into code components, which were recreated as design components in Figma. We found some inconsistencies and bugs in the code components while building the kit, which we were able to immediately improve on the website (isn&#39;t it amazing how much you notice when you study every single component, line by line?). As the project came to a close, we had more confidence than ever in both our design files and our code components.</p><p>So, design informs development, which informs design, which informs development further—polishing everything with each loop. And, on that note, I better get back to Figma to add the latest batch of new components.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="jTPiZ2AijOZw" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Now, you can check out a starter pack of the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/958381589801778722">Tailwind UI kit</a> on the Figma Community.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Courtney had been in the middle of a passion project: building a digital transit map of the San Francisco Bay Area in Figma, inspired by the New York City <a href="https://new.mta.info/maps">subway maps</a>. After working with Courtney’s family, Figmates across teams sought to remix and build on Courtney’s work. Since we didn’t have access to the Figma file, a group of us set out to build the map from scratch.</p><p>With his family’s permission, we’re publishing the map as a Figma Community file. But, it’s incomplete! Since <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisarvinsf/status/1258916804925091840">we only had a few images</a> to base the map off of, there are still a few missing pieces. The Figma Community has always been about sharing and building on each other’s work, and we encourage you to share and build on Courtney’s work.</p><p>By publishing it as a Figma Community file, we’re hoping that anyone who’s passionate about public transit, maps, and design will be able to help us complete it. We encourage you to <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/956623390014016984">check out the file</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-figma-community-comments/">comment on it</a>. </p><p>To build on the map: </p><ol><li>Check out the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/956623390014016984">transit map</a>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Duplicate</strong> button.

      <title>By the numbers: one year of remote work</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/by-the-numbers-one-year-of-remote-work/</link>
      <description>How work has changed over the past year, and what collaboration looks like through the lens of two Figma customers</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>As we pass the one year mark of <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-work-is-changing-at-figma/">working remotely at Figma</a>, there’s so much to reflect on. Here, Growth Data Scientist Wendy Lu shares how an experiment to enable remote collaboration kicked off a larger workstream to understand changes in collaboration more broadly. We found that users are collaborating more across regions and time zones, designers are working more closely with their cross-functional colleagues, and people are starting to include collaborators earlier in the design process. Below, read more on our findings (and methodology), and see how these trends come to life at Atlassian and Dropbox.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="wacKgXXD5Z8u" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>At Figma, the data science team follows an embedded model, allowing us to have functional expertise and feel like one unit, while also going deep on specific product areas and building domain knowledge. I’m embedded on the growth team, whose goal is to test which features and experiences will deliver the most value to our users. Whether we’re refreshing user onboarding or improving sign-up flows, we rely on experiments to quickly test these changes and measure their impact. </p><h2 id="better-enabling-remote-work"><a href="#better-enabling-remote-work">Better enabling remote work</a></h2><p>After <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-work-is-changing-at-figma/">going remote</a> last March, we at Figma—like so many other companies—were looking for ways to collaborate and bring offline processes and workflows online. As we increasingly used Figma as the virtual home for everything from <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-run-a-remote-brainstorm/">brainstorming</a> to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/research-remotely/">research</a> to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/keeping-that-tightknit-feeling-at-a-distance/#connect-with-activities-in-figma">team-building activities</a>, we developed a hypothesis around the changing environment: that if we develop, source, and surface collaboration templates built specifically for remote work, we’ll see an increase in collaboration—even beyond design. This projected increase in collaboration would mean that templates facilitate remote work, potentially easing some of the pain points we heard from users (and experienced ourselves!).</p><p>The growth team quickly built a “template picker,” allowing users to create new files from blank presets or templates designed for remote work use cases. We ran an experiment with a portion of our existing user base, serving the template picker to users in the experiment treatment group. The goal was to see whether—and how—teams would use these templates, and the resulting impact on collaboration.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb690e9035b2d2fdd14c925b5c71d4f58d90e051-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The template picker we used in the experiment</figcaption></figure><h2 id="our-learnings"><a href="#our-learnings">Our learnings</a></h2><p>We found that users who received the template picker had a 5% higher rate of collaboration, measured as % of users making edits or comments in a shared file. Additionally, we observed that users discovered new features through the template picker—10% more users discovered frame presets, and 90% more users leveraged files from the Figma Community in their file creation process. And, this remained true across designers and their cross-functional colleagues—the most popular files include both design-centric use cases (think: remote design sprints) and broader applications like whiteboarding and team-building activities.</p><p>Even though the experiment was run on a portion of our user base, it didn’t go unnoticed. We received positive feedback on social media and requests to add templates for more use cases to the template picker. In short, teams not only use this content, they appreciate it. The Figma Community is all about <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-community/">bringing users together</a> to share, learn, and connect—this was the perfect example of how we can uncover ways to collaborate in this remote-first world by leaning on each other’s work.</p><p>More than anything, our biggest takeaway is one we already knew to be true internally—that collaboration bleeds far beyond design. And, the more people get into the groove of collaboration on product and UX design, the more they’re likely to work better together, across use cases. </p><h2 id="collaboration-mapped"><a href="#collaboration-mapped">Collaboration, mapped</a></h2><p>After seeing positive reactions from the community, we set out to quantify those changes and map the patterns across companies and regions—especially considering that over 80% of Figma users are outside of the U.S. As the global workforce moves remote, we’re observing more collaboration across countries and timezones. The visualization below shows invites and file shares between users across different countries. Each connection represents a share and each country is shaded by the number of cross-country collaborators, where darker countries have more collaborators.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f033e7b850f08db25c2289bd4d0b59d17095a5-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f033e7b850f08db25c2289bd4d0b59d17095a5-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f033e7b850f08db25c2289bd4d0b59d17095a5-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f033e7b850f08db25c2289bd4d0b59d17095a5-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f033e7b850f08db25c2289bd4d0b59d17095a5-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b9f033e7b850f08db25c2289bd4d0b59d17095a5-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>File shares among Figma users around the world</figcaption></figure><p>Here’s a more detailed look at what we found:</p><h3 id="across-regions"><a href="#across-regions">Across regions</a></h3><p>In 2020, Europe was the fastest growing region for cross-country collaboration, with double the file shares in February 2021 compared to the same month one year ago. At the global level, collaborative files across different timezones grew 3.5x (versus 2.6x growth on all collaborative files) in February 2021, compared to the same time last year.</p><h3 id="between-designers-and-their-colleagues"><a href="#between-designers-and-their-colleagues">Between designers and their colleagues</a></h3><p>Within teams, we’re seeing a trend in which more and more non-designers join their teams’ design workspaces and become part of design workflows. Among professional teams and organizations, the ratio of designers to non-designers grew from February 2020 to February 2021, meaning that there were 25% more non-designers for every designer in a team. As the need for asynchronous communication grows, designers are inviting more view-only collaborators to their files for real-time feedback. This trend is reflected in both a growing number of file shares between designers and their cross-functional colleagues (+140%), as well as an increasing editor-to-viewer ratio (+12%) within the last year.</p><h3 id="within-the-design-process"><a href="#within-the-design-process">Within the design process</a></h3><p>In addition to more non-designers and viewers engaging in a more collaborative design process, we also observed that more teams started collaborating in Figma earlier in the file lifecycle. We measured &#34;time to collaboration&#34; based on the number of days between file creation date and the first time a collaborator (someone other than the file creator) opens the file, within a 90 day period. The average time to collaboration on files dropped 11% from pre-COVID to Q2—when most companies started working remotely—and remained steady throughout 2020. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bf3869707dd285911c85d8b83fac3be1144cf75e-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bf3869707dd285911c85d8b83fac3be1144cf75e-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bf3869707dd285911c85d8b83fac3be1144cf75e-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bf3869707dd285911c85d8b83fac3be1144cf75e-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bf3869707dd285911c85d8b83fac3be1144cf75e-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bf3869707dd285911c85d8b83fac3be1144cf75e-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="moving-offline-processes-online"><a href="#moving-offline-processes-online">Moving offline processes online</a></h2><p>Based on our data—in addition to our own experience working remotely at Figma—we noticed that designers were increasingly sharing with their cross-functional colleagues, and that collaboration more fluidly moved across orgs and team structures. So, we connected with the teams at Atlassian and Dropbox to hear their observations, and map their collaboration pre- and post-COVID.</p><h3 id="cross-functional-collaboration-at-atlassian"><a href="#cross-functional-collaboration-at-atlassian">Cross-functional collaboration at Atlassian</a></h3><p>In early March 2020, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> expanded their use of Figma right as they closed their offices for the pandemic. Designer Jake Miller says that moving over to working in a Figma file has more closely echoed the feeling of being in the office with colleagues. &#34;Seeing everyone’s cursors in action actually makes it feel like you&#39;re collaborating, rather than just handing things off piece by piece,” Jake says. “It&#39;s social design.” And this level of collaboration extends beyond the design team, across disciplines. By <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1221692/figma-for-confluence?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview">embedding Figma files in Confluence</a> , “everyone is a part of the design process,” says Jake. “No one is left out of the loop.”</p><p>Most importantly, being able to work together in one file has meant feeling less like a remote workforce, and more like a team. “We didn&#39;t even realize what we had been missing on the design side. It made remote work feel like team work again.“</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f1dcfc03be967e037c966a1a6ebfaeed9a7db8d9-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f1dcfc03be967e037c966a1a6ebfaeed9a7db8d9-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f1dcfc03be967e037c966a1a6ebfaeed9a7db8d9-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f1dcfc03be967e037c966a1a6ebfaeed9a7db8d9-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f1dcfc03be967e037c966a1a6ebfaeed9a7db8d9-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f1dcfc03be967e037c966a1a6ebfaeed9a7db8d9-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A look at the Atlassian team’s collaboration in Figma, pre- and post-COVID</figcaption></figure><h3 id="async-first-at-dropbox"><a href="#async-first-at-dropbox">“Async first” at Dropbox</a></h3><p>As part of <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/redesigning-dropbox-ways-of-working/">transitioning to a virtual-first model</a>, Dropbox has moved a portion of collaboration away from meetings and towards file-centric work, taking an “async by default” model. “While it’s natural to want to hop on a call whenever something comes up at work, this behavior has led to major Zoom fatigue, communication overload, constant contact, and a lack of time to focus on strategic and creative work,” says Dropbox VP of Design, Alastair Simpson.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbede1c9c37b56dde4192deddfd89f335ec7e7bc-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbede1c9c37b56dde4192deddfd89f335ec7e7bc-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbede1c9c37b56dde4192deddfd89f335ec7e7bc-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbede1c9c37b56dde4192deddfd89f335ec7e7bc-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbede1c9c37b56dde4192deddfd89f335ec7e7bc-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbede1c9c37b56dde4192deddfd89f335ec7e7bc-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A look at the Dropbox team’s collaboration in Figma, pre- and post-COVID</figcaption></figure><p>Instead of defaulting to meetings, the Dropbox design team has moved most work to collaborative files. Alastair says that this new way of working preserves the team’s most important resources: time and energy. “With async work, pauses between messages and verbal communication are not only accepted but also appreciated. They create space for us to elevate our work and make the time we spend together even more valuable,” Alastair says. </p><p>The team is also trying to share more openly, which translates to sharing work with a broader audience. “Rather than hosting a gigantic meeting, we have started recording our design reviews and sharing them out with notes so that folks can watch them on their own time,” Alastair says. “These practices help us level the playing field and become more nimble and inclusive designers.” </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="-c0a0eR_DdB6" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Over the past year, so many companies have had to fundamentally change the way they work, if not entirely upend their business model.

      <title>Behind the feature: comments, contextually</title>

      <description>How the team handled difficult interactions and edge cases to bring comments into the Figma Community</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>We recently introduced commenting on files in the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community">Figma Community</a>, allowing you to ask questions, share your opinion, or offer feedback. Here, engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/emilyiszhong">Emily Zhong</a> shares how she and a team across design, product, and engineering thought anew about what it means to connect and engage in the community. She provides insight into the difficult interactions and edge cases, and a behind the scenes look at what we left on the cutting room floor.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="71_7OfPqLyp8" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>One evening, as I was scrolling through the Figma Community, I stumbled upon this <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/859501036833143591">WatchOS Clock Animation file</a>. After duplicating the file, I realized that the prototype’s starting frame was set incorrectly. I wanted to offer this feedback (and share how much I loved the resource!), but I wasn’t sure how to get in touch. After some digging, I found a personal website and Twitter account that finally led me to the creator’s email address. In hindsight, had I not been an <em>avid Figma Community user</em> (or an engineer on the product), I might not have gone through the hoops to find a way to communicate with the file creator. </p><p>When we <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/bringing-the-community-together-in-figma/">first announced the Figma Community</a>, we were excited to bring the hundreds of thousands of Figma users together in our product to share, learn, and connect. But it’s not just about searching for resources and deciding whether you want to install a plugin or duplicate a file. If the goal was to connect users, we needed to facilitate a deeper level of engagement.</p><p>To do that involved introducing a new paradigm of what interacting in the Figma Community could look like. Our vision was to enable two types of comments: general comments—which show up as a feed below the file—or contextual comments, which follow the existing in-editor commenting design of attaching notes to a specific place in the file itself.</p><h2 id="old-meets-new"><a href="#old-meets-new">Old meets new</a></h2><p>When we first started working on bringing comments into the Figma Community, I thought it would simply be a matter of layering the existing comments interface and code onto the file preview, with maybe a couple lines of code changed here or there. As with any code-repurposing project, there were a couple of technical hiccups: we had to replace the previous iframe file preview to support viewport information communication, and consider the performance implications of a potentially large number of comments.</p><p>Surprisingly, one of the largest wrenches in the development process was less about the technical challenges and more about the back-and-forth feedback cycle on minute interaction details. This really uncovered how <em>different</em> interactions had to be to make them <em>seem the same</em> as the in-editor commenting we were trying to port over.</p><p>A lot of this boiled down to the fact that we were turning a one-way alleyway into a two-way street, with no clear guidelines on how to tunnel traffic into the new direction provided. In other words, we were providing a new avenue of audience-to-creator communication on a platform that was mostly creator-to-audience, via published resources. Beyond that, we were breaking the generally linear paradigm of comments, often thought of as a feed of questions and input. With contextual comments, we needed to think more spatially, specifically about how a comment would anchor to a point on the design while still allowing users to view and pan across the canvas. Top of mind was arriving on the best experience to encourage the audience to leave comments on files, without degrading the existing view-only experience.</p><h2 id="initial-explorations"><a href="#initial-explorations">Initial explorations</a></h2><p>Throughout the whole development process, we formed a tight feedback loop between engineering, design, and product, as we scoped out how to best modify the file viewing real estate to support contextual comment creation.</p><p>Our designer, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/explore-the-figma-community/">Heather Tompkins</a>, and design intern <a href="https://twitter.com/jemmakwak">Jemma Kwak</a> kicked things off by exploring a wide array of options for what commenting in the Figma Community could look like. Since the experience inherently required a lot of user interactions, many of these mocks weren’t the usual static wireframes that most projects were built off of. Instead, we relied on gifs demonstrating how the viewing experience might be altered to account for comments.</p><figure><figcaption>Sidebar comments feed exploration by Jemma Kwak, a design intern</figcaption></figure><p>The group generated a lot of great ideas, including places to embed a new comments feed, as well as ways for the user to interact with the canvas preview to better view comments. With such detailed prototypes available, we were quickly able to scope out and narrow down the product behavior based on technical feasibility, UI edge cases, and the general product timeline.</p><figure><figcaption>One of many mini-viewer explorations by designer Heather Tompkins</figcaption></figure><p>In the process of this exploration phase, we revisited inputs from the product, engineering, and design sides, and prioritized the ones we deemed essential for the initial launch. In turn, we decided that we wanted to:</p><ol><li>Bring the users into the commenting experience as quickly and easily as possible, to encourage users to browse and use this method of communication</li><li>Display contextual comments in a space large enough to really analyze and understand the file location the comment was placed in</li><li>Arrive at a solution that was technically feasible, within our timeline, and not overly-complex</li></ol><p>With these goals and constraints in mind, we decided that contextual comments would appear only in the fullscreen view, where there would be enough screen real estate to view the relevant context. To bring the user closer to the comments-viewing experience, we opted to have the viewer expand to fullscreen mode upon clicking on the canvas; clicking and panning would be disabled on the minimized canvas view, to encourage viewing the file in fullscreen.</p><figure><figcaption>Prototype of full-window file preview experience</figcaption></figure><h2 id="back-to-the-drawing-board"><a href="#back-to-the-drawing-board">Back to the drawing board</a></h2><p>Once we had mostly built out the commenting experience, the team got together for a routine bug bash, during which we test out the feature to catch hidden bugs. By this point in the development process, we usually catch a couple small bugs (think: misaligned text, broken buttons, or edge cases) that cause the feature to break. This time, we realized that there was a bigger problem—the UX felt a little awkward and clunky, so we needed to spend more time on refining the experience. After putting our heads together, we identified the specific UX issues and came up with approaches to fixing them:</p><h3 id="no-exit"><a href="#no-exit">No exit</a></h3><p>The first one was that the current design made it too simple to enter fullscreen mode, but too hard to exit. In an effort to make the commenting experience easier to access, we decided that any click on the canvas expand to a fullscreen view. However, this meant that users who accidentally clicked on the canvas—or those who were used to exploring on the smaller preview size—would be forced into a view where the only escape was a small “collapse” button in the upper right corner. The ease of entering and the lack-of-ease for exiting created a “trapping” experience for those using it.</p><p>To address this, we played with a couple of options to decrease the extent this larger preview dominated the screen. We tried switching from a fullscreen experience (where the page would takeover the entire desktop) to a full-window experience (taking up the browser window, but still giving user control over the page). In the end, we went with a modal solution brought up by <a href="https://twitter.com/jesszwang">Jessica Wang</a>, another engineer on the comments project. We took inspiration from the lightboxes from photo-sharing websites, reusing the expected enter-and-exiting behavior that this design pattern afforded. We also brought back the drag-to-pan functionality on the minimized view, allowing users who did prefer to navigate that way to do so.</p><figure><figcaption>The new in-modal expanded preview experience</figcaption></figure><h3 id="feed-vs-preview"><a href="#feed-vs-preview">Feed vs. preview</a></h3><p>Another issue that we identified was a disconnect between contextual comments in the feed versus in the file preview. While one way to explore contextual comments was through the fullscreen preview mode, another was in the general feed below the file preview. There, contextual comments were mixed in with the non-contextual comments, and clicking on a contextual comment would bring the user up to the top of the page, to view the comment in the preview.</p><p>We realized that this behavior could be unexpected, because we didn’t differentiate between the two types of comments enough in the UI, and it wasn’t clear whether or not the scrolling action would occur after clicking on a comment. Additionally, after the user was brought to the top, they would have no way of returning to their previous spot, aside from manually scrolling back down. This meant that if a user unintentionally clicked on a contextual comment, they’d be thrown into a completely different part of the page—with no clear way to get back.</p><p>To solve this, we added more visual indicators for contextual comments, like a pin icon next to the commenter avatar and a “See in context” blurb to indicate the scroll-to-top behavior. We also built a “back” button that appeared after scrolling to the top, allowing the users to easily return to their location on the feed.</p><figure><figcaption>Example of the &#34;scroll back&#34; button to navigate back to the general feed</figcaption></figure><h2 id="fun-implementations-along-the-way"><a href="#fun-implementations-along-the-way">Fun implementations along the way</a></h2><p>Throughout the development process, there were a lot of fun, animation-related problems that greatly improved the experience and overall polish of the final feature. Here are a couple that I found particularly fun and interesting to work on:</p><p>When clicking through comments on the sidebar in the expanded view, the default experience is to “jump” between the different locations, with no transitions whatsoever. While this experience worked for in-editor comments, this sudden jump was flagged as slightly jarring in the Figma Community, especially as users were navigating files that they were unfamiliar with.</p><p>In order to support a smooth pan between two different locations on the canvas, I had to modify viewer code directly, which is the same system used to show prototypes in Figma. Fortunately, most of the logic for interpolation between positions was already built-in, so my job was mainly surfacing animation and timing parameters to the viewer’s typescript interface. While it was a small code change, it was my first time dipping my toes in this part of the codebase and writing Skew code, which is the language that our viewer is built in.</p><figure><figcaption>The preview now pans smoothly between comment locations on the file preview</figcaption></figure><h3 id="expanding-hover-effect-on-the-file-preview"><a href="#expanding-hover-effect-on-the-file-preview">Expanding hover effect on the file preview</a></h3><p>To better indicate that clicking on the file preview would open the user up to an expanded modal, we added a slight expanding animation when the user hovered over the file preview. The most straightforward approach to this—adding to the height and width of the container element on hover—didn’t work in this case. Since the viewer re-renders when its viewport or size of the containing elements changes, the simple six-pixel expansion became choppy as the browser kept recomputing the viewer canvas for this hover effect.</p><p>The solution was to flip our thinking on its head: instead of having a smaller default state and expanding on hover, the viewer container would always have the height and width of the expanded state. We then created a separate element that was placed over the canvas, with a border that masked the edges of the viewer to make the canvas seem like the minimized size. When hovering, instead of increasing the size of the canvas, we decreased the border width of the overlaid mask, revealing the edges of the viewer that were previously hidden and creating the illusion of expansion when hovering.</p><figure><figcaption>The file preview expands slightly when hovering over it</figcaption></figure><h3 id="animating-between-the-default-and-expanded-modal"><a href="#animating-between-the-default-and-expanded-modal">Animating between the default and expanded modal file preview</a></h3><p>When the user clicks on the file preview, we animate it from its default state to a modal state. While the change in size is not that difficult to animate, the part that was difficult was animating between two different types of positioning placement, <code>position: absolute</code> to <code>position: fixed</code>. The <code>position</code> CSS attribute determines how the coordinate system is set up when we set the <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code> CSS attributes for an element.</p><p>When the file preview is in its default state, its position is set to <code>absolute</code>. This means that the <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code> coordinates we use to determine the positioning of the file preview is relative to its parent container, which is nestled nicely in the flow of the page between the title and the description. When the file preview is in its expanded state, however, its position is set to <code>fixed</code>, meaning that the coordinate system is relative to the browser window instead of the container in the page flow. The <code>fixed</code> position is often used for “sticky” elements, like a navigation bar that freezes at the top of the page and moves with you, no matter how far you scroll.</p><p>For many CSS properties, the browser can create animations on its own given a start and end value (this works for the <code>top</code>, <code>bottom</code>, <code>left</code>, and <code>right</code> properties). However, animating between different <code>position</code> values unfortunately isn&#39;t supported out-of-the-box. We couldn’t simply change the starting or ending preview states to the other position either. Doing so meant that the default preview would always be stickied to its position on the page, no matter how far you scrolled, or that the expanded preview modal would be one that could be scrolled past.</p><p>The solution was to create an intermediary state that occurs right before the expanding and collapsing animation. In this intermediary state, we take the current state’s position value, as well as the  top, bottom, left, and right coordinates, and do a bit of math and set what the equivalent coordinate values would be in the next state’s coordinate system. This way, for a brief moment before the animation starts, the existing view is translated to the next view’s coordinate system so that the browser can interpolate and animate coordinate values. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="EaOwDausHf2P" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>The (seemingly) invisible parts of the final experience are a result of many revisions and countless gifs sent back and forth to get the animation details, timings, and edge cases just right. As a new grad engineer, it was fun and fulfilling to be part of this tight feedback loop—I had the opportunity to contribute not just code, but also my thoughts about user experience, interactions, and design. </p><p>Check out the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community">Figma Community</a> to connect with others and see comments in action.

TypeScript programs can opt-in to stricter compile time null checking using the <code>strictNullChecks</code> compiler option. When this option is enabled, TypeScript performs control flow analysis to ensure the code does not use a value that might be null in unsafe ways.</p><div><pre><code><span>

In non-strict code, this is of the most common types of error, and our historical data shows that a few of our high-severity incidents would have been caught by strict null checks before landing on production.</p><p>Strict null checks also improve the quality of code. Maintaining code involves asking questions about the code such as “is file info loaded at this point in the code?” Expressed in the type system, these questions often boil down to “can this value be null?” When the answer is right in the type, the code is much more maintainable.</p><h2 id="incrementally-enabling-strict-null-checks"><a href="#incrementally-enabling-strict-null-checks">Incrementally enabling strict null checks</a></h2><p>Although today the TypeScript community recommends starting new projects with strict null checks enabled, Figma started using TypeScript prior to TypeScript 2.0, when strict null checks were first implemented. Even after upgrading, we wrote new code that didn’t necessarily compile with the setting enabled. Our situation wasn’t unique: JavaScript codebases where types have been added incrementally also often don’t have strict null checks enabled, because JavaScript is inherently non-strict.</p><p>Migrating such codebases to strict null checks is challenging. Merely turning it on can generate thousands of errors. When we started the project, our frontend codebase of ~1162 TypeScript files generated over 4000 errors, and in many cases fixing one of them would reveal even more errors. It was clear that while this migration was not nearly as drastic as a full rewrite in a different architecture or language, it would require a similar thinking process. Here’s a few ways one might do it:</p><h3 id="stop-the-world"><a href="#stop-the-world">Stop-the-world</a></h3><p>We could have asked all our engineers to stop working on their current project to participate in the migration.</p><p>We didn’t feel this was the right decision: the work involved in migrating is parallelizable but not <em>that</em> parallelizable, so having everyone stop their work was not an optimal use of time. It would also have been strategically questionable, as our product work at the time was critical to maintaining business momentum. Finally, the logistics of coordinating between multiple teams becomes less practical the larger companies get.</p><h3 id="whack-a-mole"><a href="#whack-a-mole">Whack-a-mole</a></h3><p>Another approach is to fix errors from enabling strict null checks over time, without actually enabling strict null checks (e.g. running them only during CI).</p><p>This is the least disruptive approach. The downside is that without strict null checks enforced, new code tends to introduce new errors. At startups that grow exponentially, that can be a lot of new code: during the time it took us to complete the migration, our codebase increased from 376k to 464k lines of code. A “whack-a-mole” strategy can still be reasonable if errors can be fixed faster than they are introduced, but having a “progress bar” that even occasionally moves backward is not fun.</p><h3 id="progressive-allowlist"><a href="#progressive-allowlist">Progressive allowlist</a></h3><p>The approach we’ve taken is to strict null check one file at a time by adding them to an allowlist.</p><p>Before talking about the details of this approach, we’d like to give credit where it’s due! We were inspired by <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/05/23/strict-null">the VS Code team’s effort to strict null check</a>, a codebase similar in size to ours. We started from the tooling they built, then extended it to better solve problems unique to our codebase.</p><p>The core of this approach is to compile the codebase twice: once for all files without strict null checks enabled, and once for a list of files that are known to compile successfully with strict null checks enabled.</p><div><pre><code><span>

</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>A key observation is that compiling a TypeScript file requires compiling all its dependencies (imports). That means that unlike some other more lint-like flags like <code>--noImplicitAny</code>, it makes sense to strict null check a file only if its dependencies are also strict. Therefore, a file can be added to the allowlist only after its dependencies are in the allowlist.

It’s a set of scripts that use the TypeScript Compiler API for dependency analysis, which we found pleasantly easy to use. We started off with what the VS Code team had built, then adapted it for our codebase.</p><p>First, we had to deal with quirks in our codebase that get in the way of static analysis. For example, the tooling had trouble resolving <a href="https://basarat.gitbook.io/typescript/main-1/barrel">barrel imports</a>, a TypeScript feature that allows bundling together exports from multiple different files. We used this in only a handful of places, and it was simplest both for the migration and the codebase simply to remove them.</p><p>A major addition to the tooling was the ability to deal with dependency cycles, which were common in our codebase at the start of the project. Dependency cycles made it more difficult to perform the migration incrementally: it’s not possible to add a single file in a cycle to the allowlist unless you add all of the files in the cycle simultaneously. In terms of the dependency graph, we had to treat each cycle as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component">strongly-connected component</a>, which effectively becomes a single node in the dependency graph.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670&amp;h=439&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3aafbec1d7b9ab24c6775cb94f637e34c63fb947-1608x1054.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The largest cycle we had was a 500+ file monstrosity — almost half our codebase! In addition to unblocking the strict null check migration, breaking up this monolith would also improve the architecture of the codebase. To do so, we targeted common patterns that were causing cyclic dependencies. For example:</p><ul><li>Figma uses Redux, so we have models, actions and reducers. We had previously been defining the models in the same file as the reducers. By moving models into their own file, the action file no longer needed to import from the reducer file, breaking the cycle.</li><li>All the modals in our UI were in the same cycle. They were all imported by the modal renderer in <code>modal.ts</code>, but each modal also imported constants from <code>modal.ts</code>. Moving the constants to its own file broke the cycle.</li></ul><p>Fixing these root issues reduced the size of the cycle by hundreds of files. Merging them was challenging because they touched hundreds of files and often conflicted with other people’s commits. In one case, we used <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jscodeshift/">jscodeshift</a> to automate the refactor, which made it easier to rebase &amp; re-generate the entire refactor on top of the latest master.</p><h2 id="the-migration"><a href="#the-migration">The migration</a></h2><p>The initial phase of “scouting out” the landscape — setting up tooling and removing blockers like cycles — was done by a small group of engineers. After that point, the codebase was well set up for the whole team to contribute. We hosted two three-day sprints where members from different teams across Figma contributed to strict null checking files, particularly in their areas of expertise. All in all, 30 engineers contributed to the effort at various points in time. This was a good way to get more people involved, without being disruptive to other teams.</p><h3 id="execution-policy"><a href="#execution-policy">Execution policy</a></h3><p>An important aspect of this migration was to establish guidance around how much effort to spend migrating each individual file. While some errors can be fixed just by changing a type annotation, many others require refactoring the code to prove nullability (or lack thereof).</p><p>For example, consider this common way of using a stack, which will fail to compile under strict null checks:</p><div><pre><code><span>
</span><span></span><span>// stack: Array&lt;number&gt;</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>stack</span><span>.</span><span>length</span><span> </span><span>&gt;</span><span> </span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>const</span><span> v </span><span>=</span><span> stack</span><span>.</span><span>pop</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>// type: number | undefined</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>v </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>// error: Object is possibly undefined</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>It is clearly correct by inspection, but requires either a non-null assertion ! or rewriting it differently:</p><div><pre><code><span>
</span><span></span><span>const</span><span> v </span><span>=</span><span> stack</span><span>.</span><span>pop</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>if</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>v </span><span>!=</span><span> </span><span>null</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>v </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>// ✅</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Which then led the question: should we tell the team to just avoid refactoring while migrating, or to refactor whenever possible?</p><p>To avoid refactoring, a lot of type annotation needed to be made nullable by adding <code>| null</code> whenever it’s hard to prove that a value can’t be null. This, in turns, requires adding a lot of non-null assertions or a lot of if-statements. The former still leaves the code vulnerable to errors. The latter can be misleading to future readers when the if-statements turn out to be redundant. Either way, it makes the type annotations hard to trust, which reduces the value of strict null checks.</p><p>On the other hand, refactoring while migrating can make the whole process take much longer. It often requires the engineer not only to understand the code, but the corresponding product area to understand if nullability is intended. It also risks causing regressions.</p><p><strong>At Figma, we encouraged the team to refactor when possible</strong>. We believed the additional investment was worth it to make sure our type annotations could be trusted by future maintainers. While the migration did introduce a few regressions, our engineers are full-time employees and were around to fix them. Finally, we posit that if code broke during migration, it must have already been hard to reason about (with respect to nullability) and would likely be regressing later.</p><p>But the “when possible” part is important too. At the end of the day, the goal was to complete the migration, and being in a partially-migrated state has downsides — having two instances of the compiler eating up the CPU being one of many. So while we recommended refactoring, we also opted to give the team a lot of discretion and let people take shortcuts when it would take too long to do otherwise.</p><p>Of course, the tradeoff will vary by situation. For example, in an open-source project with volunteer contributors, or in a system with a lot of legacy code, it may be a lot more troublesome to deal with regressions.</p><p>Once a majority of files passed strict null checks, the remaining work became less parallelizable. At that point, we switched from an allowlist to a denylist approach, using the <code>exclude</code> option instead of <code>files</code>, so that new files are automatically compiled under strict mode. At this point, a few engineers were able to convert the remaining files and complete the project.</p><h2 id="parting-thoughts"><a href="#parting-thoughts">Parting thoughts</a></h2><p>In terms of catching errors, we can say that null errors no longer show up in our error dashboard. However, we would like to re-emphasize: the biggest benefit, though hard to measure, is probably the increased readability of our code. The parts of the code where TypeScript has the most trouble inferring nullability were often the ones that were hard for humans to reason about — and benefited the most from refactoring.</p><p>With all that said, this migration wasn’t a straight path to the target. There were periods of time with very little activity where everyone (including the drivers of the project) were busy with other tasks. Fortunately, the benefit of an incremental approach is precisely that it provides flexibility in planning. Being able to make small progress in the beginning was helpful in building momentum, and then finally complete the migration.</p><p>So while most of you might not need to do this <em>exact</em> migration, we hope this has served as a useful example of large-scale code changes!</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="bgDdJ0tyGiFB" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>If this type of work sounds interesting to you, <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">learn more about the team and Figma</a> — we’re hiring!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/redesigning-dropbox-ways-of-working/</link>
      <description>How the team moved to a virtual-first model</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After nine months of rearing its head, the COVID-19 pandemic has left a lasting impression on the future of work.  Employees have scattered throughout the country, teams are struggling to build authentic connections and the 2pm case of the Zoomies are officially the new norm. With work from home becoming a prolonged reality, companies are redesigning the way in which employees show up at work each day.</p><p>While some, like Figma, have opted to move to a <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-work-is-changing-at-figma/">hybrid working model</a>, others, like Dropbox, have decided to adopt a <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/company/dropbox-goes-virtual-first">virtual-first approach</a>. No matter which direction a company takes, they all struggle with the same issue: how do we maintain that feeling of togetherness in this new world? </p><p>Though Dropbox makes software that helps people work from anywhere, most of their employees came to an office every day. The company had Maker Rooms and Collaboration spaces sprinkled throughout their twelve global offices; their corporate culture was literally physically designed for in-person collaboration and creativity. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/94c1b7a4cae062a63a7a992bb20b0bec63b76bce-2602x854.png?rect=1,0,2601,854&amp;w=670&amp;h=220&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/94c1b7a4cae062a63a7a992bb20b0bec63b76bce-2602x854.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/94c1b7a4cae062a63a7a992bb20b0bec63b76bce-2602x854.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/94c1b7a4cae062a63a7a992bb20b0bec63b76bce-2602x854.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/94c1b7a4cae062a63a7a992bb20b0bec63b76bce-2602x854.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/94c1b7a4cae062a63a7a992bb20b0bec63b76bce-2602x854.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The Dropbox design team at a workshop, pre-COVID</figcaption></figure><p>The design team, for example, would often be found ransacking their workshop toolbox for post-its, sharpies, dinosaur figurines, or anything else that would help spark creativity ahead of design sprints and impromptu brainstorming sessions. Getting into a creative flow was as simple as jumping into a room together. </p><p>In this new remote world, getting into that flow takes more intentionality, which can be hard. We are completely shifting norms that have been part of daily work for decades. Dropbox had to redesign the way in which teams come together to create online, while also maintaining that same energy that once was found in their physical space.</p><h2 id="redesigning-collaboration"><a href="#redesigning-collaboration">Redesigning collaboration</a></h2><p>After <a href="https://dropbox.design/article/design-tooling-at-scale">migrating their design organization to Figma from Sketch</a> back in 2018, the Dropbox design team had a head start when it came to remote collaboration. The team already had established best practices for virtually every stage of the creation process — brainstorming, wireframing, prototyping, and commenting. As Lauren LoPrete, design systems lead, put it, “Figma has helped us simplify our workflows and also up-leveled the quality and efficiency of our work across design at Dropbox.” But once the pandemic hit and the team went fully remote, they needed to do more. </p><p>In an effort to reignite that creative spark that once happened IRL, the now-remote designers rely on Figma even more to streamline their workflows and remove any breakdowns in communication. For example, instead of in-person design review meetings, the team utilizes observation mode in Figma to follow along with the presenter as they showcase work. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f802eb4af57259d74cbb49b42269bd9ae9ccf44-3840x2082.png?rect=0,0,3840,2080&amp;w=670&amp;h=363&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f802eb4af57259d74cbb49b42269bd9ae9ccf44-3840x2082.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f802eb4af57259d74cbb49b42269bd9ae9ccf44-3840x2082.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f802eb4af57259d74cbb49b42269bd9ae9ccf44-3840x2082.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f802eb4af57259d74cbb49b42269bd9ae9ccf44-3840x2082.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f802eb4af57259d74cbb49b42269bd9ae9ccf44-3840x2082.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Screenshot of a Figma file from a product exploration</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than pair designing side by side or walking over to someone’s desk to brainstorm live, designers simply share a Figma link and jump into a file to quickly iterate on ideas together. </p><p>As cross functional communication becomes more important in remote work, designers host their design sprints virtually with engineers and PMs in Figma. Because it&#39;s online and accessible to all, Figma makes it easy for teams outside of design to jump in and participate. </p><p>Designers also had to adapt their existing Figma workflows and introduced new ways of communicating async. For example, the Design System and Brand Studio teams streamlined their handoff process, designing a Figma template for icons in which a brand designer will place a ✅ next to the page once the icon file is complete. Since their library release happens every Monday morning, the Design Systems team will check the file and convert any new icons to the master library, then hit publish. This has helped eliminate unnecessary comms and made the overall process more efficient — so much so that team plans to apply a similar process to other collaborative libraries.</p><p>As Stan Yeung, product designer, put it, ”Figma has become the center of our universe since the pandemic, with more communication and collaboration happening within the design files themselves.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?rect=1,0,1598,1040&amp;w=670&amp;h=436&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3683cbdb0142084ede0757c3220b5f36fab5bf3-1600x1040.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Organizing themes in action, from a design team brainstorm</figcaption></figure><h2 id="figma-for-all"><a href="#figma-for-all">Figma for all</a></h2><p>As the broader organization braced itself to transition to fully remote, the design team became the model for how teams can work together, virtually. As such, Cheechee Lin, a product designer, ran a couple of experimental Figma workshops with the larger cross-functional team to help get them up to speed on how to navigate Figma and use the main features like commenting, exporting and viewing/following. The goal was to get everyone comfortable with Figma so they could jam together again, just like they did in their office space. </p><p>Cheechee explains, “We realized that bringing counterparts in to the process in Figma not only helped speed up our iteration cycles but also provided a space to visually communicate together — especially given the lack of whiteboards in a virtual-first world.” </p><p>The training was such a success, they expanded the workshop to more than 200 attendees across teams like marketing, research and data science.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670&amp;h=428&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf6e1174b1bb9b87d7e910719bd0748c9157f97-1600x1022.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Virtual high-fives at the XFN Workshop</figcaption></figure><p>Figma is now open to the entire Dropbox organization and is a space where anyone can jump in, be creative and communicate visually together.

      <title>Meet us in the browser</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/meet-us-in-the-browser/</link>
      <description>Reflections from co-founder and CEO Dylan Field on the first five years of Figma</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When my co-founder Evan and I <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-meet-the-internet/">launched Figma in closed beta five years ago</a>, we bet everything on the browser. Like many others that used Google Docs at school and then returned home to virtual worlds, we intuitively understood that Internet native software embodies values like collaboration, transparency and access. Pretty much everyone around us — friends, classmates, coworkers we had interned with — shared these values, so we assumed they were self-evident.</p><p>We didn’t realize that launching Figma was heresy, a generational assault on top-down, siloed models of decision making and a challenge to the identity of many designers. While some immediately understood the potential of building design software in the browser, our vision elicited an immediate and negative reaction from others. Some even told us that if this was the future of design, they were changing careers.</p><p>Feeling threatened by change is part of being human. It was only natural that moving what had previously been an offline, single-player experience into the browser would be a shock to many. The fears were sensible. I think many designers felt that more transparency would lead to an over-demystification of the design process, more micromanagement and tighter deadlines. For many, inviting others into Figma represents an implicit loss of control. (And if you’ve ever looked at how designers structure their layers, then you know how much designers like control!) Finally, increased access brings with it the most existential question of all: if anyone can design, what does it mean to be a designer?</p><p>Initially I didn’t understand the negative reactions to Figma’s closed beta launch. I only saw the obvious benefits: a single source of truth for files, cross platform support, and multiplayer editing. Now I understand that the power of the browser lies in the broader cultural change it delivers — and this change can be scary. The browser is natively multiplayer. It forces a mindset shift on access. It strips away the need for expensive hardware. And it pushes us to embrace working together, especially when we are blocked and our default might be to hide.</p><p>One of the best parts of my job as CEO of Figma is playing anthropologist. Over the past five years, I’ve seen firsthand how working in a collaborative digital space moves teams from a mindset of “my ideas” to “our ideas.” This requires a radical shift — a level of trust and transparency that many of us are still catching up to. In many ways, design is deeply personal, and opening up that work to others to build on and remix can feel like opening up a part of yourself. But that’s why this change is so important.</p><p>Zooming out, the browser isn’t just about better workflows or improved collaboration. Working in the browser is part of a multi-decade global shift from physical spaces to digital spaces, massively accelerated by COVID-19. Like physical spaces, digital spaces help us connect to one another. Unlike physical spaces, digital spaces have no walls: by default they are non-hierarchical. Everyone is invited to brainstorm, build, and play together. </p><p>In <em>Understanding Media</em> Marshall McLuhan writes about how “all technologies are extensions of our physical and nervous systems.” But at its best, Figma is much more than a digital extension of our physical self—it’s an invitation to leave ego at the door and create shared consciousness with others. It’s an opportunity to embrace the messy bits of creativity, to celebrate failure and bring more people into the process along the way.</p><p>Figma’s vision is to make design accessible to all. If we succeed, putting Figma as a skill on a resume will be as absurd as highlighting Google Docs proficiency. The browser brings us closer to this vision, but we have a lot of work still ahead. We hope Figma can support every role, in every part of the design process — from ideation to production, imagination to reality.</p><p>I hope this level of openness and access will extend far beyond design and product development. We can’t allow hardware, specialized tools and titles to block that progress. As technologists, we have a responsibility to make it so that more people can use our platforms, not fewer. What I’ve seen over these past five years is that the browser is the medium to ignite that impact. If you make software, I challenge you to build with this ethos. Our teams and our products — dare I say our society — will be better for it.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="uihU7iFxHMQH" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em>Thank you to Alia Fite, Craig Mod, John Lilly and Kevin Kwok for their help and feedback on this post.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We live life in scatterplots—jumping from interest to interest and job to job looking for the right fit. From any given point, we can’t forecast the trend looking forward. That’s why it’s intimidating to choose a next step. We want to make a move that reinforces a trend line we cannot yet see. It is only in looking back that our path is clear.</p><p>It’s understandable, however, that we want to know where we’re going and that it will be a meaningful use of our time. The average person will spend 90,000 hours (one third of their waking time) working. Work constitutes significantly more of our lives than eating, vacationing, talking to grandma, or, thankfully, exercising. It’s second only to sleeping.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c4e83f5b9e6f75405acd82fc337b23302ba7a13-1600x600.png?rect=0,0,1600,599&amp;w=670&amp;h=251&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c4e83f5b9e6f75405acd82fc337b23302ba7a13-1600x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c4e83f5b9e6f75405acd82fc337b23302ba7a13-1600x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c4e83f5b9e6f75405acd82fc337b23302ba7a13-1600x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c4e83f5b9e6f75405acd82fc337b23302ba7a13-1600x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c4e83f5b9e6f75405acd82fc337b23302ba7a13-1600x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Beyond the sheer number of hours, work is at the center of how we make a living.

(And, for many, necessity drives life in this direction). But having the opportunity to pursue a career, and especially one designed around your passions is a great privilege. Why not make the most of it? The intersections of your hobbies and interests can serve as a guide.</p><p>When I was a kid, my mom brought home a shiny white box full of what must have been 50 floppy disks to install new software called CorelDRAW. When she finally fired it up, she showed me how it provided a canvas to arrange clipart, text, and color. Overnight my life’s purpose became designing posters—I printed out pages to ask my parents for ice cream, cheer on my brother’s youth football league, and run for treasurer of my student council (“Vote for Kylie...it makes cents”). </p><p>Fast forward to college, where my brother’s hippest friend was a designer. Not only was Rob talented, he was confident and singular in his focus—design was his destiny. While I was interested in working in tech, I didn’t have nearly the experience Rob did. Design felt out of reach and instead I interned in everything else: recruiting, marketing, engineering, and project management. </p><p>In one of my internships, I was lucky to befriend a hip, but approachable designer who demonstrated that craft was perfected through hard work and tireless iteration. Katherine was patient enough to give constructive feedback on my most Frankenstein ideas and built my confidence to earnestly give design a try. </p><p>It was only years later that I realized that design had always been one of my interests. The poster hustling hobby of my youth became the foundation of my career. A quick look at my hobbies could have given me the confidence to pursue my passions sooner.</p><p>Technology (CorelDRAW) combined with my other passions of storytelling and people makes product design an obvious fit.

So while the rest of us started pushing paper, he sought out jobs like managing restaurants in the mountains and working with the Boy Scouts in the desert.

      <description>The evolution of Auto Layout and more on the latest version</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Today, we’re excited to release the latest version of Auto Layout, introducing a new look and more flexibility to layouts in Figma. Here, we’re sharing the backstory on the previous versions of Auto Layout, the product tradeoffs we made, and how the feature has evolved over time. To get started, check out the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/784448220678228461">playground file</a>, sign up for <a href="https://figma.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_XnLmGvmIT9uo7tbSTGFWJw">office hours</a>, and read on for the journey we took to get here.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="HbpEDEUiOo44" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>When we first launched Auto Layout, we really focused on making it approachable and usable. Over time, we worked hard to incorporate user feedback, bringing more power and flexibility while keeping an intuitive editor experience. Ultimately, this led to where we are today—a refreshed and revamped Auto Layout that goes beyond just a new coat of paint.</p><h2 id="resizable-dreams"><a href="#resizable-dreams">Resizable dreams</a></h2><p>Before we <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-auto-layout/">launched Auto Layout in 2019</a>, resizing designs in Figma was a manual task. For example, if you were designing a dialog box with several buttons and needed to make the text in one of the buttons longer, you had to manually resize that button to accommodate the extra characters, scooch the other buttons over to make room, and then resize the dialog container to fit everything—all while keeping padding and spacing consistent.</p><p>We’ve all been there, and it’s frustrating. Beyond feeling tedious, this type of manual work can become a roadblock to building responsive design systems. It’s why bringing the power of automatic layout to designers has always been in our plans.</p><p>In fact, early designs of Figma incorporated ideas of automatic layout in the sidebar. While it was an unlabeled dropdown under the “Layout” section of the properties panel, the idea was the same. Instead of manually laying out objects within a frame, users could rely on Figma to do the work automatically, with options for vertical or horizontal layout. Unfortunately, this wasn’t implemented when Figma launched, and traces of the fabled Auto Layout laid dormant in Figma’s source code until <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-making-of-maker-week/">Maker Week</a> 2018.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670&amp;h=339&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/524014e789823976a0355f537ab5ff9b68203485-1600x810.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Early designs of Figma included the idea for automatic layout</figcaption></figure><p>During this week when all Figmates can do and build anything they want, our product director <a href="https://twitter.com/skuwamoto">Sho</a> breathed new life to our Auto Layout dreams by reimagining the feature in prototypes. The following year, I joined Figma and landed on a newly formed team whose goal was to make Auto Layout a reality.</p><h2 id="team-alignment"><a href="#team-alignment">Team alignment</a></h2><p>When we started building Auto Layout, we were inspired by the power and versatility of flexbox. (Figma’s <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/">built on the web</a>, so how could we not be?) We knew that mirroring this concept would help drive alignment between code and design. But at the same time, we still needed to make Figma’s layout system easy to understand and accessible to use—without requiring a deep knowledge of browsers and CSS. Thus, our guiding principle was born: “Auto Layout should be a thoughtful subset of flexbox.”</p><p>This sort of mission statement for the team guided the design decisions we made, unlocking functionality while reducing the number of moving parts for ease of use. Ultimately, this boiled down to a few core concepts: </p><ul><li>Auto Layout can be enabled on a frame, allowing components to be laid out vertically or horizontally</li><li>Vertical and horizontal spacing between items can be set</li><li>An Auto Layout frame will hug its components in the main axis while the other “counter” axis can also be set to a fixed width to hug the components</li><li>Components in Auto Layout frames can each have their own alignment to the container, either being aligned left, center, or right—or top, center, or bottom in horizontal Auto Layout frames</li></ul><p>It was really helpful when <a href="https://twitter.com/mwichary">Marcin</a>, the designer of Auto Layout, started by making a prototype completely in HTML. It gave us a feel for the feature early on and helped us iron out <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1202618685795553280?lang=en">many details in our first version</a>, like frame handle decoration, drag behavior, and outlines.</p><h2 id="stretch-goals"><a href="#stretch-goals">Stretch goals</a></h2><p>The first version of Auto Layout quickly proved to be useful. I also noticed that Figmates were using the feature internally to organize everything from artboards to presentation slides and create reusable components like sticky notes and name tags. But we knew we had more work to do. </p><p>Auto Layout allowed for automatic alignment to the left, right, or center of a frame. However, as the frame grew, the components would stay the same size. What designers needed was “stretch”—an alignment option that would allow components in an Auto Layout frame to expand, filling the entire width or height of the container, no matter how it was resized. </p><p>It sounds pretty straightforward on paper, but actually getting this to work in the layout engine was tricky. In the first version of Auto Layout, containers only relied on the size of their components, so it was guaranteed that by laying out the components first, and containers last, you would end up with a valid layout. However, stretch meant that the components could also depend on the size of their containers, so our layout assumptions no longer held up. We had to develop a new engine that could handle these new relationships, with the ability to go back and forth between container and component to make sure all layout demands were met.</p><p>On the design side, we played around with some pretty bold ideas. Looking at help center articles and feature requests, we found a lot of designers referring to Auto Layout alignment options as “constraints,” which is another feature in Figma. Conceptually, there were many similarities, as they both included options for left, center, right, and now stretch. We toyed around with the idea of Auto Layout being integrated into the constraints panel, making Auto Layout feel more integrated with the rest of Figma’s layout tools. </p><p>However, we ended up shipping stretch without these UI changes because we already had additional features in mind for the next iteration of Auto Layout. It was important to give ourselves the necessary time and space to thoughtfully change the UI in a way that would comfortably include all of them.</p><h2 id="staying-flexible"><a href="#staying-flexible">Staying flexible</a></h2><p>As we began to design more flexibility into the next version of Auto Layout, we got a much needed team boost. <a href="https://twitter.com/eymlin?lang=en">Emily</a>, our new product manager, learned flexbox to put together an amazing spec that included everything from flexbox terminology to relevant support tickets to user requested features. <a href="https://twitter.com/sawyerhood?lang=en">Sawyer</a>, an engineer on an adjacent team, whipped up a quick prototype on a Friday night, incorporating many of the advanced layout features on our wishlist. And <a href="https://twitter.com/rsms">Rasmus</a>, our designer, got to work exploring countless ideas and mockups, eventually arriving on our final designs.</p><p>When we sat down to scope and flesh out these features, we realized one of the new features—stretch in the primary axis—would introduce complexity. To date, stretch was tied to alignment and only able to be set in the counter axis. But as designers became more familiar with Auto Layout, it was pretty common to see Auto Layout frames nested within other Auto Layout frames. This revealed use cases where it would be helpful for items to stretch in the main axis as well.</p><figure></figure><p>Unfortunately, bringing stretch to both axes wasn’t as simple as adding another alignment button for stretch in the primary axis. Making the primary axis fixed would allow us to stretch items. However, adding the option for fixed size in the primary axis would also mean adding an option to align items in the primary axis when there’s free space. With container and component frames, these additions would result in two different alignment and resizing options and create a cluttered and confusing sidebar.</p><p>To simplify alignment, we made a conceptual leap to move all alignment to the container. Instead of setting alignment at the component level, alignment is set at the container level. Components can still be individually aligned by wrapping them in an additional Auto Layout frame. A point-and-click UI to set alignment (with a built-in preview), which we tucked away in a popover menu, allowed us to keep the main properties panel footprint minimal and approachable.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?rect=0,0,1640,915&amp;w=670&amp;h=374&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e42cce1d61e806c9a7a77d5f9e0fcfe0e9182c-1640x916.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A new alignment panel allows setting alignment in two dimensions, with a preview </figcaption></figure><p>With alignment taken care of, we wanted to make resizing more intuitive as well. Since a frame can’t stretch and hug at the same time, we thought about consolidating these controls into a single three-way dropdown, with “Fill Container,” “Hug Contents,” and “Fixed.” Knowing that these controls are possible in both axes, we realized that two dropdowns were necessary: one for width and the other for height. The end result was a constraints-like UI that would appear when selecting an Auto Layout frame.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/759fecb515a6543a28a4fe172552e9bb4b954b42-1600x630.png?rect=1,0,1599,630&amp;w=670&amp;h=264&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/759fecb515a6543a28a4fe172552e9bb4b954b42-1600x630.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/759fecb515a6543a28a4fe172552e9bb4b954b42-1600x630.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/759fecb515a6543a28a4fe172552e9bb4b954b42-1600x630.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/759fecb515a6543a28a4fe172552e9bb4b954b42-1600x630.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/759fecb515a6543a28a4fe172552e9bb4b954b42-1600x630.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The existing constraints panel next to a work-in-progress resizing panel</figcaption></figure><p>Testing the new UI revealed cases where both the constraints and resizing panels would show up.

In addition to building the new panel, there’s plenty of under-the-hood work the team has tackled: tweaking the Auto Layout engine itself, writing migration that allows us to introduce these new features, and preserving the layout behavior of existing Auto Layout documents. This has been a huge team effort with the amazing engineers that I get to work with every day, as well as teams across the company, from infrastructure to product education.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?rect=0,0,1600,855&amp;w=670&amp;h=358&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/edf8ed0408a9b85fd6ecc2da1118885819d7a083-1600x856.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Auto Layout, then and now</figcaption></figure><p>Taking Auto Layout from the forgotten traces in our code base to what it is today has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Q5uBR52G2Q&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7kSHHiltBqo3FK__aB5HZi">quite the journey</a>.

      <title>Bridging design and code with Variants</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/bridging-design-and-code-with-variants/</link>
      <description>Today we&#39;re launching Variants and updates to the Inspect panel to power up your design system</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Today, we’re excited to introduce <a href="https://www.figma.com/best-practices/creating-and-organizing-variants/">Variants</a>, which lets you combine variations of the same component—simplifying the asset panel and mapping components more closely to code. This feature, along with changes to the Inspect panel and updates to Auto Layout (rolling out in November!), will enable designers and developers to work more efficiently together. Below, we dive into how we built Variants, including the crucial pieces of feedback our users gave us along the way.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="_h7yuVHidF0v" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We believe that a design tool should <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/config-europe-2020-new-feature-announcements/">embrace concepts from both design and code</a>. But every product team will balance these competing considerations differently. While development is about finalizing and scaling a solution through rigor and reusability, design needs uninhibited freedom to iterate on the most promising ideas. The more freedom ideas can have, the more innovative the design solution can be. At Figma, our job is to give you the tools—however way you and your teams work—to design and develop effectively.</p><p>As we thought about how to bridge design and code in Figma, we realized the biggest opportunity was to redesign how components are treated. Not only was it difficult to find the right components and switch between related variations (bye, endless instance swap menus!), keeping your design systems organized was tedious and didn’t map to how developers think about components. </p><p>As we started to design towards this solution, we worked closely with our users to refine the experience, so it’s helpful and intuitive for a variety of use cases.</p><h2 id="aligning-how-designers-and-developers-think"><a href="#aligning-how-designers-and-developers-think">Aligning how designers and developers think</a></h2><p>As a company grows, its design system inherently gets more complex. To manage this complexity, many design system managers adopted a “forward-slash” naming convention to organize components (e.g. default/primary/large/icon). They worked around the limits of our component feature in order to communicate various states and properties that commonly exist in code.</p><p>When designing Variants, we wanted to evolve our components feature to support multiple dimensions of variation and a key:value pair naming convention, like state=”hover” and style=”secondary.” Whether your design system consists of simple, single-dimensional components or more complex, multi-dimensional ones, your components in Figma will better mirror your components in code.</p><p>After shadowing several design system managers, we noticed that they typically laid out components in a grid in order to work on different variations of a component and compare variations to one another. As a result, we architected the new Variants feature so that all variations of a single component can be laid out <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055471353-Prepare-for-Variants#canvas">side-by-side</a>—based on how design system managers actually work in Figma. </p><p>This not only proved to be useful for design iterations and library maintenance, it also opened the door for us to build a simple path for users to start using the new Variants feature—simply select all component variations and click “Combine Variants” into one component set.</p><h2 id="refining-the-ui-through-usability-tests"><a href="#refining-the-ui-through-usability-tests">Refining the UI through usability tests</a></h2><p>After nailing down component organization, we wanted to design a UI that was both intuitive to use and easy to consume. We built a functional prototype and ran 4 rounds of usability tests over the course of 6 weeks.</p><p>One of the harder design challenges to solve was communicating the new key:value naming construct. Our first designs showed all available property values as pills. However, we soon discovered that users struggled to understand this UI as it behaved differently than they intuitively expected. </p><p>Because pills are commonly used for tagging an object with multiple attributes, our original premise of always showing all values as pills did not work. After a few iterations, we simplified and switched to a dropdown menu design, only showing a simple input field for every property when a specific variant is selected.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?rect=0,0,3428,1688&amp;w=670&amp;h=330&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1270f0c812885e1555a128349194cf6ea9d8570-3428x1690.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>However, we kept the pill design whenever users wanted to see all properties and values of an entire component set.</p><p>Another learning we discovered along the way is default naming. For example, presenting system defaults like <em>State</em> and <em>Style</em> was actually less intuitive, compared to presenting generic property values (e.g. “Property 1,” “Property 2”) which made it more clear that they should be customized to values like <em>Type</em> or <em>Size</em>.</p><h2 id="figuring-out-the-right-feature-name"><a href="#figuring-out-the-right-feature-name">Figuring out the right feature name</a></h2><p>As we got closer to launching Variants, we had to embark on what is usually the most difficult part of any product development process—deciding on the feature name. At the start of this project, we called the feature “States,” as the initial use case we focused on was supporting the complexity of interactive states. </p><p>During user testing, one of our users at Fidelity Investments pointed out that the name “States” did not fully represent the full scope and possibilities of this feature. The feature didn’t just enable users to create different states of a component (e.g. hover, active, disabled), it can flex to any property type, like type, color, size, and more: “States seems to water down the power of the feature,” the Fidelity team said. “It makes you think of just button or object states.” </p><p>While we couldn’t exactly call it “super customizable component that you can do whatever you want with—feature,” we did agree that the name needed a revisit. Variants emerged as a much better way to capture the complexity the feature can support.</p><p>As we started to use “Variants” in subsequent usability tests, our users further validated that name was more intuitive and representative of the scope of the feature. </p><p>Paired with the upcoming Auto Layout updates and the new changes to Inspect panel, Variants is working to help you design and develop products more efficiently. And with the help and invaluable feedback from our amazing beta users, the new Variants feature is available today to everyone. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="zTkc_18oFYWc" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Check out a walkthrough of Variants in <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/903303571898472063">this playground file</a> and get more tips in <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056440594-Create-and-use-variants">this help center article</a>.

      <title>Behind the feature: the hidden challenges of autosave</title>

      <description>The technical challenges of updating our autosave system</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>We recently expanded <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040328553-Can-I-work-offline-with-Figma-">autosave in Figma</a> so you can work offline without worrying about losing changes. Engineer <a href="https://twitter.com/digitalfreepen">Rudi Chen</a> takes us behind the scenes of building this update: how we made product decisions, managed large merge conflicts, and navigated the complexities of Figma’s multiplayer technology.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="agEmrosFHwyp" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>It wasn’t so long ago that software made you hit the save key obsessively. After all, we’ve all had an unlucky circumstance in which we closed the application accidentally, it crashed, or we lost power—and hours of work. In online applications like Figma, we flush changes to the server as soon as they’re made; offline changes can’t sync with the server until you reconnect to the internet. Until recently, users ran the risk of losing data should something happen to their computer or browser while offline.</p><p>With our newly expanded autosave system, edits now save to disk when a document becomes disconnected from the server so changes to the document persist—even if the tab with Figma closes. When the user next reloads this document in a new tab, the changes will be restored and uploaded to the server.</p><p>But why does such a feature warrant a blog post? “Saving the file to disk periodically” isn’t exactly a groundbreaking innovation. But as it often happens, interesting challenges lie not in individual features, but the interaction between them. Figma’s central paradigm is being a browser-based, cloud-based, and realtime application. <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">We’ve written</a> about how we handle conflict resolution in multiplayer before. Now, in the process of examining autosave, we’ll see how how supporting multiplayer adds a lot of complexity to other features too.</p><h2 id="how-to-write-changes-to-disk"><a href="#how-to-write-changes-to-disk">How to write changes to disk</a></h2><p>The most intuitive way to save a document is how it has always been done: serialize the in-memory representation of the document as a backup file and write it to disk. Restoring lost changes is as simple as opening the backup. There’s not much room for things to go wrong in this approach.</p><p>Unfortunately, in the context of a cloud-based application, this approach isn’t practical both from a technical and product standpoint.</p><p>In Figma, documents are represented as a tree of layers (nodes). We refer to it as the <strong>scenegraph</strong> and it is our central data structure. It turns out that our users can and do create very large documents. We regularly see files that are tens of megabytes as a compressed binary and hundred of megabytes when loaded in memory. Serializing the largest files can actually take a few seconds. Last year, this was a big enough issue to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/">disqualify our initial implementation</a> for a plugin sandboxing.</p><p>In fact, the performance requirements for autosave are actually much higher than plugins. Even if we managed to optimize serialization by 10-20x so that it only takes 100ms, this is still unacceptable. The user would experience a regular 100ms stutter whenever we save the file since Figma is built in the browser and JavaScript and WASM are single-threaded.</p><p>It would be nice to use shared memory multithreading, but it’s barely supported by browsers and not a safe option. Rather, a typical way that Figma deals with expensive operations is to split work across multiple frames. However, this isn’t merely a browser/JavaScript problem. Concurrency, regardless of how it’s achieved, opens up an even bigger challenge: the problem that the user could make changes to the document during serialization.</p><p>In an ideal architecture, serialization would read-off an immutable scenegraph. However, while elegant, that would require an immense rewrite of the application, as the scenegraph is used by almost every bit of our product code. Furthermore, immutable data structures are not a silver bullet—they come with tradeoffs such as slower write performance and increased memory usage.</p><p>Finally, in terms of product decisions, saving the entire file also opens up non-trivial questions. Since our files are cloud-based and can be edited by multiple people at once, replacing the existing file with the backup could end up overwriting <em>newer</em> changes in the file. Leaving the backup as a copy also fails, because some files are the source of truth for shared assets (components such as buttons, modals in a design system).</p><h2 id="saving-changes-as-a-delta"><a href="#saving-changes-as-a-delta">Saving changes as a delta</a></h2><p>The alternative to saving the entire file is to write to disk only the changes made since the document went offline. We have this “delta” as part of our collaborative editing system, to keep track of which changes need to be sent to and acknowledged by the server. To restore changes, it suffices to apply this diff on top of the latest version of the document.</p><p>So the prototypical case looks something like this:</p><ul><li>User loads document</li><li>User ends up offline</li><li>User makes changes, which get stored in an in-memory pending changes buffer</li><li>Contents of the pending change buffer are committed to disk on a regular interval</li><li>Document closes unexpectedly</li><li>User loads document again</li><li>Pending changes are deserialized and applied on top of the document</li><li>Pending changes are uploaded to the server</li></ul><p>There are a few options for on-disk storage via browser APIs. Since we want to store potentially large amounts of data, in smaller chunks for access performance, and data integrity is important, we use IndexedDB. Key features include database indices and transactional operations.</p><p>The pending changes are stored as a set of property changes on a per-file, per-(node/layer) basis. This level of granularity helps achieve a balance between storage overhead and redundant IO. The more granular the changes, the more overhead is used to store each row. However, if we stored pending changes for all nodes in a single object, then we would have to write the entire set of pending changes every time a change is made. By storing changes per-node, we only need to write changes between commits.</p><h2 id="beyond-linearity"><a href="#beyond-linearity">Beyond linearity</a></h2><p>When dealing with linear history, re-applying a stored diff to a document isn’t hard. After all, that’s how undo-redo works, a pretty basic feature in Figma.</p><figure></figure><p>If Figma was a single-user application, it’d be relatively easy to ensure that [autosave] <em>only</em> needs to be implemented in the context of a linear history. For example, you could ensure that only one instance of Figma could open a file at a given time, and require the user to apply or discard autosaved changes immediately upon re-opening the file.</p><figure></figure><p>However, in a collaborative editor, documents don’t have a purely linear history. Even when users are not explicitly creating branches of their document, they are continuously creating implicit branches whenever they make local edits. We don’t normally think of these as branches, because the real-time capabilities of the editor means these transient branches get “merged” within fractions of a second. But as the animation shows below, we might say that a branch was created at some point in time.</p><figure></figure><p>The autosave feature, however, targets use cases in which the user is disconnected from our servers for minutes to hours. The client could be making much larger sets of changes and leave them on disk for days. The server could also have receiving much larger sets of changes from other clients in the meantime. Then, autosave changes are more clearly a branch that split off from the file at the time the user disconnected.</p><p>Therefore, autosave often needs to “merge” the diff on top of the latest document. And doing so creates unexpected and rather subtle issues.</p><figure></figure><p>Even in the absence of other users, it’s possible for the same user to edit a document from multiple tabs. These sets of changes must then be applied sequentially on top of the latest document.</p><h2 id="large-merge-conflicts"><a href="#large-merge-conflicts">Large merge conflicts</a></h2><p>Most of the time, merging diffs just works. After all, our data structures are designed to support concurrent editing. However, our multiplayer system is meant to handle small conflicts during editing. The assumption is that you get immediate visual feedback if changes between you and your coworker are clashing. Our system does not understand <em>user intent</em>, a notoriously hard problem, and therefore may not be able to effectively merge large-scale changes without creating a <em>mess</em>.</p><p>However, just because these large-scale conflicts are <em>possible</em> doesn’t mean that they are <em>common</em>. To optimize for making the common use case work smoothly, we automatically create a version history checkpoint (a feature in Figma similar to a Git commit) before and after applying the diff. This allows the user to easily revert the merge in the event in these special cases.</p><p>A more proper solution would be to create an interface that would allow users to resolve merge conflicts. However, effectively representing diffs visually for a 2D design document is still an unsolved problem in the industry and could well be a larger project than autosave itself. (Of course, that’s also worth solving, but as a separate problem.) By making product decisions such that the two projects aren’t interdependent, we can function more effectively as an organization. It may be less exciting, but it lowers coordination overhead needed when adding more people to a project. It also makes it easier to validate our solutions incrementally. Sometimes, we run into unexpected technical limitations or user feedback that require us to redo parts of a project. Leaner projects lower that risk.</p><p>When a technical solution isn’t available yet, we can also help mitigate the issue via product solutions. We also show UI in the file browser that actively prompts the user to restore their changes. Besides reducing the chances of server-side conflict, this design indicate that this feature is meant for crash recovery, not as a long-term local storage solution. After all, it is only storing diffs, not entire files.</p><p>The tradeoff is that when you do have changes, the UI is intentionally very prominent. Therefore, it becomes especially important to not have autosave changes if the user doesn’t “expect” to have lost changes.</p><h2 id="stale-changes"><a href="#stale-changes">Stale changes</a></h2><p>We’ve looked at the targeted use case where we leave local changes on disk and the tab closes. But the most common scenario is when the tab stays open: we write changes to disk, then latter the tab reconnects, syncs change to the server, then clears those changes from disk.</p><figure></figure><p>It’s important to make sure these changes have been cleared from disk. With autosave, an important invariant is that the node changes stored on disk are exactly equal to the pending node changes stored in memory.</p><p>Clearly, if we’re missing a change on disk, then there’s a potential data loss bug.</p><p>However, if we have extra changes on disk, that’s <em>also</em> a problem. From a UX perspective, it’s quite confusing for the user to be prompted about unsaved changes that have, in reality, already been saved to the server. But stale changes are even worse than redundant changes. For example, if one of the changes says “set the height of nodeID=15 to 100” but the user had since changed the height of that node from 100 to 50, that’s also a bug.</p><p>If we were dealing with linear history, the worst a stale change could do is no-op. Still, even no-op changes are noisy. Furthermore, with branching history, the stale change could end up overwriting a newer change. Although the checkpoint we create makes this reversible, it still appears to the user as if “Figma lost some recent edits,” thereby reducing user trust and counteracting the whole point of this feature to begin with.</p><p>We’ve run into a number of ways in which we can end up with stale changes on disk. First, there’s the asynchronous nature of the process. When a tab reconnects to the server, it sends the pending changes, then waits for an acknowledgment. Until then, the document is in an unsaved state and we prevent the user from closing the tab to avoid losing changes. However, while an autosave change is stale as soon as it arrives on the server, it is safe to clear from disk once the client has received the ack. Therefore, we consider the document to be in an unsaved state until the changes are acknowledged by the server <em>and</em> cleared from disk.</p><p>We also encountered subtle bugs. For example, some changes never got cleared from disk if a tab disconnected and reconnected. To share some context, the autosave implementation involves a document change observer to keep track of changes that need to be uploaded to the server, or written to disk. The issue was that after connecting, we reapply any local offline changes on top of the latest version of the document from the server. However, if the local change was the same as the latest server change, the property setter would no-op and short-circuit the code before it triggered the observers. As a result, the autosave system was never notified that this change needed to be removed from disk. Our solution to this issue was to take a more conservative approach. After reconnecting, it’s safer to erase the changes already stored on disk and re-serialize all pending changes. With IndexedDB, this can be done in a single transaction.</p><h2 id="essential-complexity"><a href="#essential-complexity">Essential complexity</a></h2><p>On one hand, the additional complexity to implement autosave is largely <em>accidental</em>, having only to do with the particular design of the system. The exact wrinkles to iron out will differ from system to system. However, the fact that there are many of these sorts of wrinkles is fundamentally due to the branching that occurs because of Figma’s multiplayer capabilities. And that, is <em>essential</em> complexity.</p><p>The challenges we encountered implementing autosave are representative of a more general set of challenges we encounter at Figma. As much as we would like a multiplayer system to be a self-contained black box, the truth is that it&#39;s a leaky abstraction. Supporting collaborative editing as a central paradigm in our application means that we&#39;re introducing a lot more asynchronous behavior such as transient branches. This then leads to thorny issues and ultimately, more complexity in the many of the features we build.</p><p>These features are what make Figma a powerful product and as a side effect, there are always plenty of interesting engineering challenges to solve. If collaborative editing and building reliable systems sounds interesting to you, <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">we’re hiring</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How Kimberly-Clark brings your favorite paper products into your home</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-kimberly-clark-accelerated-growth/</link>
      <description>A look inside their digital presence</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since the coronavirus outbreak began, <a href="https://www.kimberly-clark.com/en/">Kimberly-Clark</a>, the company behind household brands like Kleenex, Scott, and Huggies, has had to increase production and reallocate inventory to where consumers need it most. In doing so, they beat Wall Street’s expectations this past quarter with a posted revenue of $4.61 billion.</p><p>But just a few years ago, the company’s growth curve told a different story. Even though a quarter of the world’s population touches Kimberly-Clark’s products every day, changing consumer preferences, stiff competition, and increased production costs stifled demand. Amid layoffs and cost reduction in 2018, they embarked on a new initiative to accelerate growth by the company’s 150th anniversary in 2022. At the core of this initiative was to double down on the digital presence of their personal care products. </p><h2 id="going-digital-starting-with-a-web-based-design"><a href="#going-digital-starting-with-a-web-based-design">Going digital starting with a web-based design platform</a></h2><p>Today, Kimberly-Clark has over 400 global consumer-based websites and a large portfolio of digital products. From managing pricing, manufacturing, distribution, merchandising, shelving, sales, to people operations, every step of the process has a digital component to make sure their products get from their mills to neighborhood stores. </p><p>With so many brands and 175 countries to localize for, there’s a lot that goes into building a cohesive digital experience. </p><p>“We needed to start by changing how we worked,” said UX Manager, Andy Ford. “Our designers were jumping through so many hoops—spending weeks designing alone in proprietary Mac based applications, uploading files into a cloud prototyping platform, waiting for stakeholder feedback, going through the loop again to make edits. And when we were finally ready for development, we faced yet another hurdle when trying to hand-off design files to developers who were not on Macs. Obviously, this process slowed down how we launch new products.”</p><p>Having used Figma previously, Ford knew that consolidating tools within a single platform would solve these inefficiencies. “With Figma, everything is just there,” Ford said. “It becomes the single source of truth. Nothing is saved locally and anyone you invite can easily join to view and edit a file. Feedback meetings transformed into collaborative real-time working sessions with our various stakeholders. Everyone started to participate in the making process and could see design updates come to life in front of their eyes.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?rect=0,0,1778,913&amp;w=670&amp;h=344&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0df8d34ac49c92c24827f4708a020a929976138e-1779x913.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="_71-increase-in-signups-when-design-problems-are"><a href="#_71-increase-in-signups-when-design-problems-are">71% increase in signups when design problems are solved as a team</a></h2><p>While teams started closely collaborating and design workflows grew more efficient, it was also important to Ford to measure whether or not their work materially impacted consumers’ experience on their websites. To do so, he keeps a close eye on the engagement metrics the UX design team cares most about—bounce rates, return visitors, or time on site and signups for awards, coupons, or newsletters. </p><p>“One of our websites had a form that contained 13 fields because our marketing team wanted to collect lots of info upfront,” Ford explained. “But obviously more fields tend to yield lower signup rates. Instead of debating this in a meeting, our brand, marketing, and design teams all jumped into Figma together and designed a solution to reduce the friction down to 5 fields.” </p><p>After the new form went live, it led to a 71% increase in signups. “Because of Figma, we were able to solve the problems on the fly as a team and walk away all believing in the same direction,” Ford said. “This helps us get our products to market faster.”</p><p>Seeing the impact of these design changes, the team is already planning new digital initiatives. Next up: a new design system that integrates from Figma, to Storybook, to their code repository. As Kimberly-Clark approaches its 150th birthday, perhaps a new, more design-led chapter awaits.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="4rlBdqZkil8C" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em>For more stories and uses cases, check out how <a href="https://www.figma.com/customers/">other leading design teams use Figma</a>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Last week we shared Halli Thorleifsson’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBB7A9kbH-k&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">closing keynote</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/creating-moments-of-connection/">some of our favorite takeaways</a> from Config Europe, Figma’s first virtual user conference. Today, we’re releasing all 22 breakout sessions, which you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7kSHHiltBqo3FK__aB5HZi">watch here</a>. If you’re not sure where to start, read on for a glimpse of the moments that really stuck with us.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="fb48J13X0uvr" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Halli reminded us to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBB7A9kbH-k&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1450">find meaning in what we do</a>, and how our work should be a balance of <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/creating-moments-of-connection/#function-and-feeling">function and feeling</a>. So many talks at Config Europe did just that. With tactical tips for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meNLXEmbDOM&amp;feature=youtu.be">putting accessibility first</a> and how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNt_I7EIaro&amp;feature=youtu.be">keep design in sync with code</a>, and reflections on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YeK72q2CRQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">tech ethics</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ETLYF7R7j0&amp;feature=youtu.be">what it means to fail together</a>, breakout sessions covered craft and skill, while really getting us to think about what it means to work better as a team.</p><h2 id="expanding-the-team"><a href="#expanding-the-team">Expanding the team</a></h2><p>Processes are central to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/building-an-open-and-inclusive-design-process/">making design more open</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/ChibiOcti">Declan Talbert</a>, UX Designer at University of the Arts London, suggests that design systems are the foundation. While design systems may seem like tools built just with designers in mind, they can be a resource for everyone involved in product development. He asks, “How might we make a design system inclusive to allow anyone to contribute to [and] use the system?” It’s <a href="https://youtu.be/b8NNfdRcgpI?t=310">not just about pattern libraries</a>, Declan says, noting that design systems can include different types of components like accessibility, data, and project management. </p><p>This openness extends beyond tools and resources. “Designers are opening up,” Declan says. “We’re accepting more people outside our design circles.” Just like how close collaboration with people across the product development team can make a design system more effective, welcoming more people with a diverse set of skills into the process—across design, development, product management, and beyond—will result in more “human-centered design, products, and services,” Declan says. “It’s all about expanding the team.”</p><h2 id="celebrating-failure"><a href="#celebrating-failure">Celebrating failure</a></h2><p>Figma’s <a href="https://twitter.com/kelseymwhelan">Kelsey Whelan</a>, Product Manager, and Product Designer <a href="https://twitter.com/nikolasklein">Nikolas Klein</a> agree that getting diverse perspectives results in better products, even (and especially) when that means failing in front of each other. For Niko and Kelsey, “failing together” was a huge part of the success of Variants, a feature <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/config-europe-2020-new-feature-announcements/#supporting-design-systems-that-mirror-your-code">we announced</a> at Config Europe.</p><p>As the team started testing early versions of the feature, they realized “it was really powerful,” says Kelsey, “but it wasn’t very approachable,” which meant that they still had work to do. “We wanted this feature to be one that anyone at Figma could use—or any Figma user could.” Once they made adjustments and were ready to conduct usability testing, what they thought would be a series of short tests over a couple weeks turned into four rounds of testing over six weeks. In other words, Kelsey says, “We were much further off than we realized.”</p><p>They decided to make the most of the remote environment and invite everyone at Figma to participate. In addition to those who worked directly on the product, Figmates across teams—including designer advocates, product educators, and engineering managers—joined usability tests via Zoom. With these different perspectives, the team even caught some bugs during the sessions and discussed fixes in the dedicated Slack channel. “Of course it’s hard seeing that your ideas aren’t working,” says Niko. But once the working group incorporated feedback and people started to get it more intuitively, it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ETLYF7R7j0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1324">even more rewarding</a> to see things work.</p><p>The usability tests were a reminder that inviting more people into the process results not only in a better experience for our users, but also in a more open culture for our team—one in which failure is considered an opportunity to improve, iterate, and as Niko says, “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ETLYF7R7j0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1286">fail forward</a>,” together. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="Ar3_00ANkFyu" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>It has been exactly one month since Config Europe, and we still can’t get over the fact that nearly 10,000 of you across 150 countries virtually came together to learn, share, and connect.

      <title>Reflections on Figma’s inaugural Student Fellowship</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-inaugural-student-fellowship/</link>
      <description>What Figma Fellows accomplished, and our plans for next year</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, as we were putting together our plans to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/bringing-figma-to-even-more-classrooms/">bring Figma to more classrooms</a>, we were excited to make on-campus meetups a core part of the way we worked with students. (Figma’s community of professional designers was doing this already in cities around the world and we were looking forward to bringing our learnings to the student community). When it started looking like many students wouldn’t be heading back to campus in the fall, we went back to the drawing board. Instead of focusing on local, campus-specific programs, what could we create that would ripple out beyond classroom walls? </p><p>We started by talking to students to learn what would be most impactful to help them navigate this new world:</p><ul><li>How are schools planning for the fall?</li><li>What will the classroom look like?</li><li>How can students and educators recreate a collaborative classroom or on-campus feeling when not everyone is in the room together?</li><li>How do students come together to work on extracurricular projects?</li></ul><p>This got us to a few key areas we wanted to make progress on this summer: classroom resources, student stories, our Virtual Campus Slack Community, and hackathons. To decide what that progress should look like, we brought in a few students in close to build things they, themselves, would find useful and joyful. </p><p>It was an experiment; we didn’t know what we would learn but we were excited to see. Spoiler alert: it was a major success. Here’s a picture of the group from our kickoff! </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6ba92f0c640bf2bfa1d9deb7175e7707ae3204ba-1600x1557.png?w=670&amp;h=652&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6ba92f0c640bf2bfa1d9deb7175e7707ae3204ba-1600x1557.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6ba92f0c640bf2bfa1d9deb7175e7707ae3204ba-1600x1557.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6ba92f0c640bf2bfa1d9deb7175e7707ae3204ba-1600x1557.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6ba92f0c640bf2bfa1d9deb7175e7707ae3204ba-1600x1557.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6ba92f0c640bf2bfa1d9deb7175e7707ae3204ba-1600x1557.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>From top left, clockwise: Molly Mielke, Film Degree at UCLA; Brie Wolfson, Figma for Education; Andrew Hulin, Technology and Business at USC; Abigail Africa, Technology and Business at USC; Sarah Adebabay, Computer Science at UC Berkeley; Stacy Lin, HCI Design, minor in Business at UC San Diego</figcaption></figure><h2 id="setting-our-vision-for-the-program"><a href="#setting-our-vision-for-the-program">Setting our vision for the program</a></h2><p>Beyond shipping new content and resources, we wanted to build an approach that would make the most impact holistically. Top of mind was laying the foundation for potential fellowship programs down the line, and how that might complement on-campus ambassadorships and (our new) <a href="https://friends.figma.com/">Friends of Figma</a> program in the future. We put our heads together to define longer-term goals and map out how we’d work together over the summer...in the middle of a global pandemic. </p><p>As we started these conversations, it immediately became clear that  we wanted our reach to go beyond the student community, extending to the team at Figma and the broader design ecosystem. We oriented around the overarching goal of creating spaces and resources that were both accessible and aspirational for students. We also talked about how we wanted to work together, and it was clear that even though we were working on separate “workstreams,” the group felt like one cohesive unit.</p><h2 id="what-we-shipped-together"><a href="#what-we-shipped-together">What we shipped, together</a></h2><p>Here’s what the team shipped in 10 short weeks:</p><h3 id="classroom-resources"><a href="#classroom-resources">Classroom resources</a></h3><p>We created 6 new templates for classrooms around the world to use, whether they’re online or IRL. Some of our favorites include <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/880495488581892604">this toolbox</a> for running research projects, <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/874662166663257269">this playground file</a> for ramping up on Figma’s editor, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/879800083544815050">this template</a> for issuing classroom assignments. </p><p>We also curated <a href="https://www.notion.so/Figma-s-Design-Resources-for-the-Classroom-35a82c1a4a8c4f3db68f031d99cf5766">this set of classroom resources</a> from across the community to help teachers and students learn, create, and make the most of Figma. </p><h3 id="student-stories"><a href="#student-stories">Student stories</a></h3><p>As we talked to more students about what they would find most useful, we learned there was one question that so many students in our community were trying to answer: should I take a gap year? </p><p>So, we published a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG">Back To School? Series</a> on the topic. Dylan Field, Figma CEO and college dropout, interviewed great thinkers Marc Andreessen, May-Li Khoe, Karlie Kloss, John Maeda, and Laura Deming on the topic. They shared their perspectives and experiences about how to think about taking a gap year and the value of education more broadly. </p><p>We also published <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/on-pitching-and-presenting/">this guide</a> on pitching and presenting especially for students.</p><p>Throughout the summer, over 1,000 new students joined us in our Slack Community, Virtual Campus, to connect, teach, and learn from each other… and have some fun. If you’re a student and all that sounds up your alley, <a href="https://figmavirtualcampus.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-el50hsaf-3mpeZsFwUudowDoxL1FkJA#/">join us</a>!</p><p>We also hosted a two-day make-a-thon, Camp Figma, where hundreds of students across dozens of time zones came together to make together. Shout-out to our winning projects, <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/885352606342978283">FigmAdventure</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Be2raGSBrCD2yYhyySOCNH/Camp-Figma?node-id=46%3A145&amp;viewport=355%2C492%2C0.039108600467443466&amp;scaling=min-zoom">Slice</a>.</p><h3 id="hackathons"><a href="#hackathons">Hackathons</a></h3><p>Figma has always made an effort to show up at hackathons, and this summer we dialed up our investment. We know that this is how so many students in our community come together to make together and how meaningful these virtual spaces have become while many of us are quarantined. So, we put together <a href="https://www.notion.so/figmaforeducation/Figma-s-Hackathon-Starter-Kit-dfd527abc75842869b3f24c2e1b4096b">this resource</a> for organizers and attendees to make sure they are taking advantage of relevant community files. </p><p>We hope to help support a whole lot more in the future. If you’re hosting an event or Hackathon and are interested in ways Figma can help out, email us at education@figma.com.</p><h2 id="what-s-next-for-the-fellowship"><a href="#what-s-next-for-the-fellowship">What’s next for the fellowship?</a></h2><p>Molly, Abigail, Andrew, Sarah, and Staci blew us away with not only their talent and hard work, but also their warmth and energy. Their work had an enormous impact on our student community, and on Figma. Above all else, we were reminded just how bright the future of design is!</p><p>We’re excited to announce that we’re doing it again next summer. We’ll share more details about the program and how to apply closer to the summer—join us in <a href="https://figmavirtualcampus.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-el50hsaf-3mpeZsFwUudowDoxL1FkJA#/">Virtual Campus</a> to stay updated.</p><p>And, as always, if you have more ideas on how Figma can be even better for classrooms, I’d love to hear from you at education@figma.com.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In doing so, they enable the freeform exploration of design while also powering the rigor and structure of code. In addition to helping teams move faster and more efficiently, design systems provide consistency and a single source of truth for your team.</p><p>But figuring out how to architect and implement a design system can be daunting. Whether it’s migrating your existing design system, scaling or optimizing a new system, or improving your design-to-development workflows, we want to make sure that you and your organization have the support you need.</p><div><blockquote><p>Figma has unlocked our ability to cocreate with our partners, giving our team the ability to move at the pace of the conversation in a platform that is as fast as it is easy to navigate.

      <description>Watch the closing keynote from our virtual user conference, Config Europe</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>On October 15, we’ll be releasing recordings of all the breakout sessions from Config Europe. Today we’re sharing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WBB7A9kbH-k&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">the closing keynote</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/iamharaldur">Halli Thorleifsson</a>.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="BsIZdpRZcH1D" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>It has been exactly three weeks since <a href="https://config.figma.com/">Config Europe</a>, Figma’s first virtual user conference, and a time for the community to learn, contribute, and connect. Presenters told stories and shared best practices while attendees met at virtual networking sessions, discussed sessions in an online chat, and <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1306557787170697216">assembled groups</a> as part of the recently-launched <a href="https://friends.figma.com/">Friends of Figma</a> program. </p><p>As we reflect on <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/building-an-open-and-inclusive-design-process/">the many takeaways</a> from the conference, more than anything, we’re reminded how design has the power to bring us together. We’ve curated some of our favorite snippets on creating moments of connection—through the work you do, the products you build, or the way you show up in the community.</p><h2 id="more-than-an-app"><a href="#more-than-an-app">More than an app</a></h2><p>Posti Group has been responsible for delivering mail and parcels across Finland since 1638. As invoices and letters become increasingly digital, the team has had to reckon with revisiting the customer experience to keep up with ever-evolving needs. So, when the team went about digitizing the entire user journey, they wanted to make sure it wasn’t just about creating a new app, but finding a way to modernize an organization that goes back hundreds of years. </p><p>To make sweeping changes, they had to adjust their approach as a company. That meant coming from a place of principles, with design at the center. They landed on a framework: grow (keep up with users as they evolve); delight (turn disappointments into something positive); reduce (provide reliable services); listen (find ways for customers to surface their needs). Design System Lead <a href="https://twitter.com/AngelosArnis">Angelos Arnis</a> says that it was a guide for the organization on &#34;what great means.” Instead of focusing on one deliverable or digital touchpoint, they thought about the entire user journey, holistically.</p><p>While a postal service is the epitome of function and efficient operations, Angelos reminds us that it’s not just about the service, but what it powers: “When we talk about Posti, we talk about 400 years of emotions,” he says. Whether it’s a love letter, taxes, or a social security card for a newborn baby, these changes will help Posti Group continue to manage people’s most important communications. </p><h2 id="character-vs-skill"><a href="#character-vs-skill">Character vs. skill</a></h2><p>ConvertKit&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/charliprangley">Charli Marie Prangley</a>, Marketing Design Lead, shares how building a brand and reputation in the design community isn’t just about whether you can create a high-performing landing page or design a beautiful logo. Rather, your brand comes down to both skills “you have as a designer” and, more importantly, character—”who you are as a person.”</p><p>Whether you’re looking to win clients, land a great job, or build your reputation, Charli Marie urges everyone to ask themselves: “How do you want people to describe you?” Creative? Kind? Fun? It’s not just about skill, craft, and function—it’s personality, connection, and humanity. By defining these characteristics, she says, as you create more and share more in the community, you’ll be able to evaluate whether your online presence is an accurate reflection of your values. When in doubt, “Do what’s authentic to you,” she says. “There’s someone out there who’s really going to value your perspective.” </p><h2 id="function-and-feeling"><a href="#function-and-feeling">Function and feeling</a></h2><p>While skill, craft, and function are all core to design as a discipline, <a href="https://twitter.com/iamharaldur">Halli Thorleifsson</a>, founder and Design Director at Ueno, urges everyone—whatever it is you’re building or designing—to <a href="https://twitter.com/iamdavidhill/status/1306624962577530881?s=20">do work that has meaning</a>. It’s never “just a website” or “just an app,” he says. Similarly, it’s not just about finding a tool or design system that works for your team; rather it’s about the work and connection that those tools enable. “What we build with our tools—and why—is ultimately all that matters,” he says.</p><p>Especially as so many of us continue to work remotely, it’s more important than ever to stay connected to each other. As Halli says, technology can unite us: “I believe it can connect us. I believe it can help us belong.” </p><p>Knowing that nearly 10,000 of you from over 150 countries came together at Config Europe, we certainly feel that way too. And while many of us came away with learnings that can help us do better work and build better products, above all, we hope that connections you made—with each other, as part of this community—are what really stick.

      <title>Building an open and inclusive design process</title>

      <description>Takeaways from Config Europe</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, we shared takeaways from Config Europe about the importance of <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-many-dimensions-of-trust-in-design/">building trust</a> with teammates and clients. Trust is the backbone of an open and inclusive culture, and the right processes—which govern how you design, develop, and work together as a team—can, in turn, result in more open and inclusive products. Here, we’ve curated more highlights from the conference on how to do just that.</p><h2 id="going-beyond-the-perfect-use-case"><a href="#going-beyond-the-perfect-use-case">Going beyond the “perfect” use case</a></h2><p>Of course, deeply understanding your users and their needs is the foundation of any good product. But that also means understanding all types of users and use cases, and familiarizing yourself with challenges and requirements that may not be top of mind. While a target persona or core use case may be your north star, <a href="https://twitter.com/furquan101">Furquan Ahmad</a>, Product Designer at Ford Motor Company, says that developing user empathy should extend beyond the “perfect use case.” </p><p>“Too often, apps and services are designed for the same core user group,” he says. To cultivate user empathy, Furquan encourages everyone to get out and experience their product “in the field.” For example, he says, If you work on a delivery app, put yourself in the shoes of someone making a delivery. It’s easy to forget that they’ll have to walk up flights of stairs if an elevator is broken in an apartment building, or they won’t be able to find their way if their GPS doesn’t work in a more remote location.</p><p>Taking a more inclusive view of your users will help you <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/888825248848211972">think more deeply about accessibility</a> as well. While Furquan says you can start by making some small accessibility improvements, like simplifying copy, colors, font sizes, and the layout of a landing page, lasting change comes with prioritizing accessibility more holistically. This also extends to “temporary” accessibility, situational considerations that otherwise may not be top of mind. Furquan says these needs might revolve around location—like if someone is in a crowded place where it’s hard to hear—or equipment (think: a shattered phone screen). Whether you’re making small changes on color contrast or rethinking your approach to accessibility more broadly, a good place to start is making sure that there’s accountability. “Who’s taking ownership at your organization?” he asks. </p><p>Getting a sense for more use cases and taking a more expansive view of your users will result in a better product. “What’s essential for some,” Furquan says, is “useful for all.” </p><h2 id="close-collaboration-across-the-organization"><a href="#close-collaboration-across-the-organization">Close collaboration across the organization</a></h2><p>For <a href="https://medium.com/@annesophie.delafosse">Anne-Sophie Delafosse</a>, Localization Manager at Deliveroo, localization is similarly part of the whole user journey. Localization isn’t just translating copy, but thinking about how syntax, language nuances, and broader cultural considerations can make your designs friendlier to markets around the world. </p><p>Up until recently, whenever Deliveroo prepared to launch a product in a new market, a designer would build a user experience and hand off that design to engineers, who would then manually upload a screenshot to each piece of translated text. Realizing that this process felt siloed and inefficient, the team decided to use the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/803669834214399971/Phrase">Phrase Figma plugin</a> to allow designers to quickly build, share, and iterate on localized designs. Now, Anne-Sophie can share these lightweight prototypes with, say, the Italian or French teams. If there’s an issue with the localized version—an inaccurate translation or not enough space for the translated phrase—the localization teams can offer early feedback at the design stage, saving engineers from having to build a new page each time. </p><p>Plus, the localization team can see how their work maps to the bigger picture: “Our localization experts see the entire flow in one go. They have the full context,” says Anne-Sophie. Beyond saving time, this new process has reframed localization; rather than a transactional handoff between the localization and design teams, it’s an essential part of the product development process. As a result, both teams better understand “what it means to create a user journey for a global audience” that spans many languages and cultures.</p><h2 id="open-processes-with-your-team"><a href="#open-processes-with-your-team">Open processes with your team</a></h2><p>Improving collaboration across your organization is key, but it starts with your immediate team. Especially as so many of us continue to work remotely, it’s more important than ever to establish more open routines and processes. “This lack of visual and spatial awareness of a teammate has meant remote working requires more transparency across teams,” says remote freelance designer <a href="https://twitter.com/katepincott?lang=en">Kate Pincott</a>.</p><p>And transparency extends to how you spend your time. Especially with remote work, it can be hard to see who’s working on what and how much time they have for meetings. Kate’s <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/888177404156464065">Team Capacity Template</a> outlines how to map out a typical week and visualize any gaps. In addition to giving everyone visibility into how others spend their time, it also helps the team work more efficiently. Since you can’t just walk over to a teammates’s desk, she recommends using regularly-scheduled meetings and quick stand-ups to catch up on a personal level. “It’s ok that we spend more time on what’s important to get us through this period,” she says.</p><p>Figma Product Designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanhsu/">Jordan Hsu</a> echoes the need to find time to work together in the absence of spontaneous in-office brainstorms and hallways chats. Jordan and his team experimented with Zoom working sessions to replicate the experience of working together in a conference room: “Anyone can join, hop on, hop off, and start conversations whenever they want,” Jordan says. Whether teammates have questions, specific discussion topics, or just want to check in on each other, it’s free time for everyone to connect.</p><p>He also recommends scheduling recurring working sessions to collaborate with cross-functional partners. “Work with me” is a two-hour block, a sort of design office hours. Recently, Product Manager <a href="https://twitter.com/benstern0">Ben Stern</a> joined a session to work through a refresh of Figma&#39;s <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-enterprise-explained/">Organization admin experience</a>. People can come with questions, conversation topics, or just observe while Jordan works to get more insight into the design process. The goal? “To keep design open and transparent throughout the company,” Jordan says.</p><p>As you <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-the-product-design-teams-process/">revisit routines</a> to adapt to remote work and find ways to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/keeping-that-tightknit-feeling-at-a-distance/">stay close as a team</a>, more than anything, build processes that bring more people in. Whether that’s taking a more expansive view of your users, working more closely with cross-functional partners, or just spending time with teammates, your products and culture will be better for it. As our CEO Dylan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWy4fB3G9Gc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=128">shared at Config Europe</a>, giving more people access to the design process ultimately makes it more open and inclusive. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="GURVoL57oG8h" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>You can <a href="https://youtu.be/lWy4fB3G9Gc?t=1">watch the full keynote here</a> and subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQsVmhSa4X-G3lHlUtejzLA">Figma’s YouTube channel</a> to get notified when we publish all of the breakout sessions, including more highlights from the speakers featured here.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>A deep-dive into font fallback</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>One of the typographical questions we get often is, “How does font fallback work exactly?” It’s not even that Figma does something unique here (although we have our own specific take), but font fallback is just complex, filled with quirks and unexpected side effects.

That line is one last glyph. It comes with a technical name, <strong>.notdef</strong>, and the dot is there to signify it’s unlike any others. <strong>.notdef</strong> is a glyph of last resort, one to be used when a font is asked for a character its designer did not bother to draw. </p><p><strong>.notdef</strong> is the original version of font fallback—a rudimentary solution for a problem that didn’t exist when printing was physical. In the world of metal type, when you hold a letter in your hand you also hold its specific font—and so it’s impossible to ask a font to output a letter it has never heard of. But computers put a strange distance between fonts and text. A computer can display text written by someone else, perhaps long ago, and using a font unknown to its creator, or one that might have not even existed when that text was created. And so a font needs to be able to say, “I have no idea what this particular character is supposed to look like.”</p><p><strong>.notdef</strong> often looks like a simple rectangle, sometimes with a cross inside. It’s a shorthand for “this space intentionally left blank.” It’s not a traditional Unicode character with its own specific code—rather, just a rectangle that is drawn to cover up for the character that should be there. When you copy and paste it, under the hood it remains the original character you wanted to see. After all, the font might be updated in the future with more glyphs, or you might simply switch to another font that supports the character you wanted:</p><figure><figcaption>Switching between two fonts</figcaption></figure><p>What gets drawn as <strong>.notdef</strong> glyph is <a href="https://typedrawers.com/discussion/comment/44240#Comment_44240%0A">for the font’s designer to figure out</a>.

Something tells me you’ve seen one of those rectangles more than a few times in your life. </p><p>And yet, you might be surprised how much more often you would see them, if there wasn’t a whole invisible, impressive, and idiosyncratic system to cover every font’s back.</p><h3 id="the-font-fallback-you-know-and-love-o"><a href="#the-font-fallback-you-know-and-love-o">The font fallback you know and love (ǝʇɐɥ oʇ)</a></h3><p>The flavor of font fallback most of us are familiar with comes from the web. It looks something like this:</p><div><blockquote><p>font-family: Joanna, Helvetica Now, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;</p></blockquote></div><p>The premise is simple: the list gives the browser a chain of command. “To render this element, use a font named Joanna. If you don’t have that, use Helvetica Now. Nope? How about an older version of Helvetica? Don’t have any of those still? Fine, just pick Arial. No Arial? Lord. Just grab whatever generic sans serif you recommend.”</p><p>The first font listed is often a web font, packaged with the website itself. If it fails to load—or if it’s taking too long to arrive—the next few recommended fonts are those already popular among users, or installed with various operating systems. </p><p>The first font is the perfect scenario. Each further notch is a deeper fallback, and a bigger compromise. You can almost imagine each one coming with a more audible groan of the website&#39;s designer, ceding control from a perfectly manicured, often unique font meant to represent the brand or the emotion of the site, to increasingly more generic fonts—reliable, sure, but not that exciting. </p><figure></figure><p>Font fallback has been there <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/#font-family">since the very beginning of CSS</a>, in recognition that there was never a time in our history where every single computer came with the same set of fonts. </p><p>Outside of a list of fonts, CSS font fallback didn’t give the web designer more specific control over font fallback: no feedback about which font is ultimately selected, no extra adjustments for size, weight, or letter spacing. I’m sad to report it still doesn’t today. The only meaningful change was the addition of a few more generic words for UI fonts which gained in popularity only within the last decade (one example is system-ui, which comes with its own <a href="https://medium.design/system-shock-6b1dc6d6596f?gi=e28dfa48756f">font fallback horror story</a>).</p><p>But even if font fallback appears old and simplistic, you might be surprised by two things. The first one is that it operates not at a level of a font, but at a level of a character. The second one? What you declare in CSS is only a small part of font fallback.</p><h3 id="fonts-as-templates"><a href="#fonts-as-templates">Fonts as templates</a></h3><p>Operating on a level of a character means the browser or the operating system revisits your font fallback chain with every single letter you ask them to print. If a font doesn’t have that one character, another font on the list is tried, and so on.</p><p>Let’s pick up the same list as above, simplified a bit:</p><div><blockquote><p>font-family: Joanna, Helvetica Now, Helvetica, Arial;</p></blockquote></div><p>The version of Joanna on my computer has 261 glyphs, covering a few adjacent alphabets, but not much else. I don’t have Helvetica Now, so we can skip that. The traditional Helvetica has a whopping 2,252 glyphs, which takes care of Cyrillic, Georgian, and Vietnamese—plus a lot of math and currency symbols. But Arial is even better. The very bastardization of Helvetica that we often scoff at delivers over 3,300 glyphs, besting Helvetica in supporting Hebrew, Arabic, and… <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semigraphics">semigraphics</a>.</p><p>If I asked my browser to typeset a multilingual sentence using the above font fallback list, it would appear as:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/20973214bf9fb50417b11184876b58e25fee0534-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/20973214bf9fb50417b11184876b58e25fee0534-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/20973214bf9fb50417b11184876b58e25fee0534-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/20973214bf9fb50417b11184876b58e25fee0534-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/20973214bf9fb50417b11184876b58e25fee0534-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/20973214bf9fb50417b11184876b58e25fee0534-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>This is not a good-looking sentence, illustrating some of the challenges with limited control when fonts fall back. German got off scot-free, its few extra umlauted letters and booming economy ensuring its coverage even in smaller fonts. But Helvetica’s Russian and Arial’s Hebrew feel off—too big and too thick—and Polish fares even worse, falling back to Helvetica for only one out of four letters. </p><p>But then again, compared to an earlier example, this is at least a <em>readable</em> sentence. The boxes, often affectionately called “tofu” by font engineers (and something not safe to print by everyone else), are now nowhere to be seen. </p><p>If you happen to be in absolute control over text, you can still pick each individual character and delegate a specific font to serve it, making everything look flawless. But you don’t have to be. And, in the universe of the web, where text can come from anywhere and any<em>when</em>, you might not <em>want</em> to be.</p><figure><figcaption>Switching between two fonts, each one with Helvetica as a fallback font</figcaption></figure><p>Carefully fine-tuning your font fallback list with fonts like Helvetica and Arial, or other popular fonts equipped with thousands of glyphs, is a great way not just to preserve style, but also to ensure coverage. It helps me sometimes to imagine fonts as templates—each ready to catch as many letters as it can, but each itself also coming with many holes. The font fallback chain allows the next font to catch letters left behind by the previous one, and so on:</p><figure></figure><p>But here’s that other surprise that you might have already spotted. None of the fonts I listed in my font fallback support the Malayalam language. None contain any emoji, either. So how come both of these still render as meaningful glyphs, rather than tofu?</p><p>It turns out that after you’re done with your font fallback list, your browser or operating system quietly adds over a dozen more fonts to help you out, including some fonts created expressly just for this purpose.</p><h3 id="the-vast-of-characters"><a href="#the-vast-of-characters">The vast of characters</a></h3><p>If Arial felt impressive at over 3,300 characters, just look at the scope of the entire Unicode. Today’s edition of the universally adopted standard that governs how to encode every character in digital communication <a href="https://unicode.org/charts/">has over 140,000 of them</a>. Tomorrow’s will have even more.</p><p>It’s an impressive number compared to early computers struggling with handling 63, 127, or—if you were lucky—255 characters. But it makes sense if you consider Unicode is meant to cover 150 different scripts (from the omnipresent Latin all the way to obscure scripts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Permic_script">Old Permic</a>, a 14th-century adaptation of Cyrillic that fell out of use 400 years ago) and tens of thousands of symbols (among them hundreds of arrows, math symbols, domino tiles, alchemy, and Egyptian hieroglyphs right next to their modern reincarnation, the emoji).</p><p>For a font designer, the task of drawing 140,000 glyphs would be brutal, exhausting, insurmountable. And even if someone chose to do that, it would result in a font file so huge it might be impossible to load. </p><p>But if no font contains all the characters, then the alternative becomes harrowing for a web designer. Imagine putting together Wikipedia’s typesetting under these circumstances—being forced to find different fonts for different parts of Unicode, remember which one does what, update them occasionally, maintain the huge font fallback chain, and so on.</p><p>Your operating system and your browser do that so you don’t have to. They accomplish that by queuing up a phalanx of fonts, and asking those fonts to catch any characters not supported by your font fallback chain. </p><p>As an example, the four-font list on my Mac gets quietly extended to look more like this:</p><div><blockquote><p>font-family: Joanna, Helvetica Now, Helvetica, Arial, Menlo, Monaco, .AppleSymbolsFB, LucidaGrande, CourierNewPSMT, GeezaPro, NotoNastaliqUrdu, Ayuthaya, Kailasa, PingFangSC, PingFangTC, HiraginoSans-W3, HiraginoSansGB-W3, PingFangHK, AppleSDGothicNeo, KohinoorBangla, KohinoorDevanagari, KohinoorGujarati, MuktaMahee, NotoSansKannada, KhmerSangamMN, LaoSangamMN, MalayalamSangamMN, NotoSansMyanmar, NotoSansZawgyi, NotoSansOriya, SinhalaSangamMN, TamilSangamMN, KohinoorTelugu, NotoSansArmenian, EuphemiaUCAS, STIXGeneral, Galvji, Kefa, .NotoSansUniversal, AppleColorEmoji, .LastResort;</p></blockquote></div><p>And the situation is similar for Windows:</p><div><blockquote><p>font-family: Joanna, Helvetica Now, Helvetica, Arial, Tahoma, Segoe UI, Segoe UI Historic, Segoe UI Symbol, Segoe UI Emoji, Cambria Math, Abyssinica SIL, DaunPehn, David, DokChampa, Ebrima, Estrangelo Edessa, Ethiopia Jiret, Gadugi, GF Zemen Unicode, Gulim, Han Nom A, Javanese Text, Lao UI, Leelawadee UI, Kartika, Khmer UI, Malgun Gothic, Mangal, Meiryo, Microsoft New Tai Lue, Microsoft YaHei, Mongolian Baiti, MoolBoran, MS PGothic, Myanmar Text, Nirmala UI, Nuosu SIL, Nyala, Phetsarath OT, Plantagenet, PMingLiU, Raavi, Saysettha OT, Shruti, Simsun, Sylfaen, Tunga, Visual Geez Unicode, Vrinda, WenQuanYi Zen Hei, Yu Gothic, Arial Unicode MS, Code2000;</p></blockquote></div><p>Many of these fonts are responsible for covering a specific locale—NotoSansMyanmar and Myanmar Text take care of Burmese alphabet, for example—while the others have more specific needs.

Languages and scripts evolved over time in a messy way, converged and diverged without a master plan, borrowed from and disagreed with each other.</p><p>Even in English, people confuse O (oh) with 0 (zero). And then, part of Cyrillic looks exactly like Latin, and a part of Latin could pretend it’s Greek. You can spell your out-of-office message “ОΟO” in a creative way like I just did, where one letter is Latin, one Greek, and one Cyrillic—and often no one will know any better. The circle itself is such a universal shape there will be no surprise that it appears over and over again in Unicode: as ◯, and ○, and ◌, and 𝗢, and 𝐎, and 𝖮, and ⚪, and ⥁, and many, many more—and as you can imagine, there are more such simple shapes. Typography, as it often does, has a special name for this: glyphs that look alike are known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph"><em>homoglyphs</em></a>. </p><p>What’s more, Unicode also uses a bunch of styled Latin alphabets. Many come from mathematics where different forms of letters mean different uses: operator names, constants, angles, transforms, tensors. Their separate inclusion in Unicode made semantic sense—after all, mathematical variable 𝑎 is different than the vector 𝐚, and a set 𝔸 should not be confused with the matrix 𝑨. But the decision to include them came with a twist. Given all of these special alphabets, Unicode itself contains what feels like <em>fonts</em>. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/426e6f66c2267becaab7a14dc501ba0e1459fd30-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/426e6f66c2267becaab7a14dc501ba0e1459fd30-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/426e6f66c2267becaab7a14dc501ba0e1459fd30-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/426e6f66c2267becaab7a14dc501ba0e1459fd30-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/426e6f66c2267becaab7a14dc501ba0e1459fd30-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/426e6f66c2267becaab7a14dc501ba0e1459fd30-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Examples of different alphabets in mathematics serving specific reasons</figcaption></figure><p>One of the blessings and curses of typography is that characters themselves are not allowed to have an opinion on how they should be used.

No text you see on your computer is meant only for human eyes.

Some of the “styles” as seen above also jump between parts of Unicode, letter by letter. And so most of them will fall back to some fonts deep within the system, and since font fallback is so different on different platforms, there’s no way of knowing exactly how any of this will appear on the other side.

And on some of computers, particularly older ones with a less advanced font fallback, one of the odd characters will keep falling back until it can fall no more—and despite everyone’s best wishes, despite all the invisible safety nets, despite the group effort of typographers working on fonts like Arial Unicode and Noto, it will become the dreaded rectangle.</p><h3 id="the-last-resort-s-last-resort"><a href="#the-last-resort-s-last-resort">The last resort’s last resort</a></h3><p>What happens when you ask for something that cannot be shown?

That means some fonts have two ways to tell you “I have no idea what to do with your request”: answering with <strong>.notdef</strong> if you’re asking for something they can’t deliver, and � if you’re asking in a way they can’t understand. </p><p>That also means that � might look slightly different under different circumstances, although the wild creativity unleashed at <strong>.notdef</strong> is nowhere to be seen here:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40db5f075c20efa1aa73095845308f67eeec4cbf-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40db5f075c20efa1aa73095845308f67eeec4cbf-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40db5f075c20efa1aa73095845308f67eeec4cbf-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40db5f075c20efa1aa73095845308f67eeec4cbf-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40db5f075c20efa1aa73095845308f67eeec4cbf-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40db5f075c20efa1aa73095845308f67eeec4cbf-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Replacement Characters from various fonts, reproduced using an identical font size</figcaption></figure><h3 id="emoji-in-bits-and-pieces"><a href="#emoji-in-bits-and-pieces">Emoji in bits and pieces</a></h3><p>So there you have it. Multiple versions of <strong>.notdef</strong>, official and secret font fallbacks, .LastResort font with its manicured question mark, and another question mark that means something else altogether. But there’s one thing that will make this even weirder—the thing that arrived not so long ago and made typography more complex for everybody.</p><p>Sure, in some sense emoji are very simple. There are no different scripts, no different languages, no bold or italic. All emoji on your computer are usually served by one big font. </p><p>But emoji are unique in at least two ways. The first one? They change. A lot. Every year seems to deliver a hundred or so new emoji, and more than a few updates to existing ones. As I write this, the latest version, Emoji 13.0, has been <a href="https://blog.emojipedia.org/whats-new-in-unicode-13-0/">announced early in 2020</a>. It itself contained 117 new emoji. Emoji 13.1 is <a href="https://emojipedia.org/emoji-13.1/">already shaping up</a> with a few contenders such as “heart on fire” and “face in clouds,” and we already know that Emoji 14.0 will be announced in about a year. For typography, familiar with units of time such as millennia, emoji move at unprecedented speed.</p><p>Like every other glyph, emoji follow the rules of font fallback. As you’ve seen above, platforms secretly add an emoji font to the chain. And you could even imagine installing various emoji fonts on your computer, and doing it the traditional way, too:</p><div><blockquote><p>font-family: NotoEmoji, AppleColorEmoji, JoyPixels;</p></blockquote></div><figure><figcaption>A hypothetical emoji fallback chain prioritizing older emoji files (Noto Sans Emoji) with less emoji coverage results in a strange phenomenon of fallback to a different, newer emoji set (Joy Pixels)</figcaption></figure><p>The reason you don’t see that often in practice is that emoji fonts—being multicolored, and even sometimes bitmapped—are heavier than even Arial Unicode and Code 2000, and use strange new font formats. (Apple’s emoji font on my computer weighs more than 200 megabytes, as much space as a few <em>thousand</em> typical western fonts.) </p><p>Even more importantly: the emoji font on your operating system is usually the one most up-to-date, so falling back to an older font wouldn’t make too much sense. But the breakneck pace of emoji means that even operating systems lag behind. Today, you could send me a text message with a ninja (🥷), a pickup truck (🛻), and a fly (🪰). Come to think of that, that would have been a very weird text message… but I could only judge it on my phone, since my computer cannot render those three 13.0 emoji yet.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/940df50910ec1261278d9e4263db76ea84f9e9b8-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;h=245&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/940df50910ec1261278d9e4263db76ea84f9e9b8-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/940df50910ec1261278d9e4263db76ea84f9e9b8-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/940df50910ec1261278d9e4263db76ea84f9e9b8-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/940df50910ec1261278d9e4263db76ea84f9e9b8-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/940df50910ec1261278d9e4263db76ea84f9e9b8-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>If the emoji font in the fallback chain fails to catch the new emoji, it most often means none of the other fonts can handle it either, meaning the emoji renders as the question mark or tofu.</p><p>Except when it doesn’t. This is the other weird part about emoji: more and more of them are composites, arriving as a few separate characters glued together with invisible characters called <a href="https://emojipedia.org/zero-width-joiner/">zero-width joiners</a>. The new black cat emoji? It’s a cat character glued with a black large square character. A polar bear? A bear plus a snowflake emoji. Woman in a tuxedo is a person in a tuxedo followed by a female gender modifier. (But don’t expect this to be consistent: A woman firefighter is a woman emoji + fire engine emoji.) And two men holding hands, one black and one caucasian? It’s five characters under the hood: a man, a dark skin tone character, handshake, another man, and light skin tone—and on top of that, two invisible joiners.</p><p>On a fresh computer up-to-date on all the necessary emoji glyphs and the recipes to assemble them, these emoji will look perfect. But for others? Instead of tofu, you might see the composite emoji’s individual parts, in a way that can useful to some (seeing a man in a tuxedo and a female symbol next to it makes it possible to imagine the meaning of the emoji), but confusing to others:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9287f4cb4963eff63c5e924d85c57c5f4c295a9a-1340x1044.png?w=670&amp;h=522&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9287f4cb4963eff63c5e924d85c57c5f4c295a9a-1340x1044.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9287f4cb4963eff63c5e924d85c57c5f4c295a9a-1340x1044.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9287f4cb4963eff63c5e924d85c57c5f4c295a9a-1340x1044.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9287f4cb4963eff63c5e924d85c57c5f4c295a9a-1340x1044.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9287f4cb4963eff63c5e924d85c57c5f4c295a9a-1340x1044.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>🥷, 🤵‍♀️, 🐈‍⬛, 🐻‍❄️, 👩🏾‍🦳, 👨🏿‍🤝‍👨🏻, 👶🏻 rendered on various computers throughout time</figcaption></figure><p>But even if helpful, it will still be—but of course!—inconsistent: any new <em>non-composite</em> emoji will fall back to a <strong>.notdef</strong> rectangle or a last resort question mark.</p><p>There is a historical symbol I really love.

The text moves too fast and travels too far, and fonts change too often for the old rules of typesetting to remain in place.</p><p>The invisible shield of font fallback is there to help in all these kinds of situations, although it comes with weird side effects—boxes of tofu, disassembled emoji, weird Twitter fonts, fonts shifting awkwardly, question marks in unexpected places. I hope those mysteries we started with feel less like mysteries right now (okay, lower your hand now, for the love of god). </p><p>And you’ll have partners along the way, too. Even if you don’t see a character, you can always copy and paste it into a search engine. An excellent web tool called <a href="https://fontdrop.info/">FontDrop!</a> will allow you to drag and drop a font and see all of its glyphs (including <strong>.notdef</strong>). And among browsers, Chrome chose to offer a lending hand—if you inspect an element, you can see not only what fonts were asked to help in CSS, but what fonts <em>exactly</em> did all the hard work:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/00fb2bc86f185d0916d4491598f74db86e038236-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/00fb2bc86f185d0916d4491598f74db86e038236-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/00fb2bc86f185d0916d4491598f74db86e038236-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/00fb2bc86f185d0916d4491598f74db86e038236-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/00fb2bc86f185d0916d4491598f74db86e038236-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/00fb2bc86f185d0916d4491598f74db86e038236-1340x754.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Chrome panel for the sentence with six extra fallback fonts that we’ve seen above</figcaption></figure><p>As always with font fallback, you can inspect the result on the receiving end. But when you’re sending it, what remains is mostly hope. And so when I write this, I have no idea whether the 🥷 emoji or the ⅌ symbol will arrive on your computer with all their 21st-century and 19th-century glory, or whether they’ll render as tofu, or one of three different question marks, or not show up at all.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bae2af4ce9f6a63dc09bb3b896d503e1fe6d210f-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;h=245&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bae2af4ce9f6a63dc09bb3b896d503e1fe6d210f-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bae2af4ce9f6a63dc09bb3b896d503e1fe6d210f-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bae2af4ce9f6a63dc09bb3b896d503e1fe6d210f-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bae2af4ce9f6a63dc09bb3b896d503e1fe6d210f-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bae2af4ce9f6a63dc09bb3b896d503e1fe6d210f-1340x490.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Three question marks you can encounter: .LastResort, Replacement Character in San Francisco, and .notdef from one specific font.

I don’t have to know which fonts those are. Everything just <em>works</em>. Similarly, I don’t have to know this for any of the 140,000 other characters my computer puts under my fingertips.</p><p>That this is at all possible, that there’s a battery of fonts ready to jump in and help me out, feels like a small miracle.

      <title>Six integrations to help your product team collaborate in Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/six-integrations-to-help-your-product-team-collaborate-in-figma/</link>
      <description>How Figma works with tools like Confluence and Avocode</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Figma, we believe in an open design platform because it allows teams to customize the way they work. An open API means teams can integrate Figma with other tools they use throughout the product development process, resulting in a more effective workflow.</p><p>While products can be designed end-to-end in Figma, you likely need to work with developers and product managers to build, test, and ship these products. And this work often happens in tools that are specifically built for those purposes. With an open platform, you can easily bring your Figma designs into these tools.</p><p>Below, we’re sharing some recently-launched integrations that make it easier to bring Figma into different stages of your product development process, whether you&#39;re  collecting feedback, collaborating with developers, or looking to quickly take designs to production.</p><h2 id="confluence"><a href="#confluence">Confluence</a></h2><p>We recently launched <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-live-figma-embeds/">private Figma embeds</a> which allow you to embed live Figma files into tools like Notion, Jira, and Dropbox Paper. Embeds are now supported in <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053110673-Confluence-and-Figma">Confluence</a>, a team workspace where product teams collaborate on documentation, plan new features, and stay up-to-date with ongoing projects.</p><figure><figcaption>Quickly embed Figma files within Confluence pages</figcaption></figure><p>Product specs and requirements are the central source of truth for developers. Since they often refer back to these documents while building a new feature, it’s crucial that everything is up to date. Embedding Figma files and prototypes within Confluence pages means that the most recent designs show up in context, so you no longer have to constantly update product screenshots.</p><p><em>Start using embedded files in your next <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence page</a>.</em></p><h2 id="gitlab"><a href="#gitlab">GitLab</a></h2><p>As developers work through sprints, they need a way to easily manage ongoing tasks while triaging new requests and issues. Product teams use <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/860845891704482356/GitLab">GitLab</a> to track tasks and review changes as they build, test, and deploy code.</p><figure><figcaption>Keep your designs up-to-date in GitLab issues</figcaption></figure><p>With the new GitLab plugin, designs can be uploaded directly from Figma into a GitLab issue, making it easy for developers to version them, review them in context, and provide feedback. Not only does this save time, it allows your team to tackle the task at hand more effectively. </p><p><em>For more details on how to install and use Gitlab’s plugin, check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR2nuehGtrU">video</a></em>.</p><h2 id="avocode"><a href="#avocode">Avocode</a></h2><p>Teams typically use <a href="https://avocode.com/design-hand-off?utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_source=figma&amp;utm_campaign=2020-09-avocode-handoff-figma">Avocode</a> during the handoff process to share, inspect, and collaborate on designs. Since unveiling their <a href="https://www.figma.com/resources/apis-and-extensions/avocode-figma-integration/">custom Figma integration in 2019</a>, Avocode has updated and released their integration as <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/821674268995163810/Avocode">a new plugin</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Grab measurements or easily export assets from your synced designs</figcaption></figure><p>The plugin helps designers specify dev-ready designs by syncing them to a project in Avocode. While designers continue to iterate on other in-progress or exploratory work, developers can access all layers in the finished Figma designs inside Avocode. This allows them to export all assets, grab values such as measurements and color codes, or copy entire code snippets in ten different languages, including CSS, CSS in JS, or React Native. Not having to jump from tool to tool to get relevant design details simplifies the handoff process so your team can quickly go from design to code. </p><p><em>Get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_SPY42V7l4">all the details</a> about how to install and use Avocode&#39;s re-launched plugin.</em> </p><h2 id="pendo"><a href="#pendo">Pendo</a></h2><p>Sharing wireframes and prototypes with the right customers early on can help your team identify critical issues well before they invest resources in building out a product or feature. <a href="https://www.pendo.io/product/guidance/">Pendo</a> is a tool used by product managers to surface feedback from customers throughout the development process. </p><figure><figcaption>Get customer feedback on prototypes while they’re using your product</figcaption></figure><p>Pendo’s integration pulls in live designs from Figma files so you can present new features or proposed updates to targeted, specific user segments while they’re active in in your product. While discussing a new feature with collaborators and internal stakeholders is important, getting customer feedback at scale can help your team understand and anticipate your user’s reactions before you build and launch a new feature.</p><p>After designers share wireframes and prototypes with the team, product managers use the Pendo integration to embed these prototypes in specific places within a product to get early and targeted feedback from users. After users interact with the Figma file, teams can use Pendo to collect feedback via survey questions and open-text responses, or schedule user research interviews. By sourcing user feedback early and often, you can ensure that the features you build address customers’ needs.</p><p><em>Start embedding Figma files in your <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360049730094-Pendo-and-Figma">next Pendo in-app guide</a>.</em></p><h2 id="bubble"><a href="#bubble">Bubble</a></h2><p>With <a href="https://bubble.io/">Bubble</a>, teams can turn designs into web apps without having to write code, shortening the time between design and implementation.</p><figure><figcaption>Import Figma designs directly into Bubble</figcaption></figure><p>To begin, your team can start collaborating on designs in Figma, either starting from scratch or building on top of a published community file. Once those designs are ready, you can import them directly from Figma using Bubble’s integration. Every frame from the file will create a new page in your Bubble app and every vector will be uploaded as an image. </p><p>After the transfer is complete, you and your team can continue refining within the Bubble app by adding logic, workflows, and database capabilities to your designs. Not needing to write lines of code will help your team quickly get from prototypes to production-ready interactive apps for desktop and mobile web browsers.</p><p><em>Check out <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360052378433">the Bubble integration</a> and get started importing Figma frames.</em></p><h2 id="maker"><a href="#maker">Maker</a></h2><p>Marketing teams can use <a href="https://www.maker.co/">Maker</a>, a no-code platform, to create enhanced content for e-commerce sites—importing directly from Figma.</p><figure><figcaption>Convert Figma designs into web pages and make live edits</figcaption></figure><p>With Maker, everything from Figma becomes a fully editable block for you and your team. You’ll be able to convert designs from Figma to create and publish new landing pages, enhance sections of existing pages, A/B test various design ideas easily, and deliver personalized experiences to your customers. This frees up time for developers on your team from having to code your designs and puts marketers in the driver’s seat. </p><p><em>You can <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055904133">learn how to</a> convert your Figma files into web pages with the Maker integration.</em></p><h2 id="start-collaborating"><a href="#start-collaborating">Start collaborating</a></h2><p>We’re excited to see what you build with these integrations. If you’re looking for more ways to customize how your team uses Figma, choose from our growing list of <a href="https://www.figma.com/product-integrations/">product integrations</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/developers">build a custom integration</a>, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/community?tab=plugins">check out thousands of files and plugins</a> available in the Figma Community.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Inside Figma: my time as a new grad</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-my-time-as-a-new-grad/</link>
      <description>Advice on finding the right role and making the transition to the working world</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Josh joined Figma after graduating from college in 2018 and is an engineer on the design systems team. While reflecting on his journey to Figma, he shares his advice for new grads as they think about taking the next step: choosing the right company, finding a role that fits their interests, and making the transition to the working world.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="A92glxScBWfK" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>I’m not going to bury lede here: I graduated from college and went from full-time student to real-world adult faster than you can say “congratulations.” I didn’t know what I was doing as a senior in college when I decided to join Figma — all I knew when I signed the offer letter was that every person I had met at Figma during my onsite was incredibly kind, thoughtful, smart, and seemed genuinely interested in understanding who I was as a person. It was unlike any other interview process. I still remember the discussion I had with the team at the lunch table that day and thinking later on that I couldn’t have had such an honest and open conversation anywhere else.</p><p>This is basically to say that I can’t in good conscience give you a “why I joined Figma” blog post, not only because it would be disingenuous for me to pretend like I possessed some kind of pre-professional prescience as a senior in college, but also because my intention is not to present my reasoning for joining Figma as authoritative or prescriptive. When I was in school, I found that most of the advice geared toward students for thinking about working life revolved around a set of boxes to check off and assessing companies by the industry heuristics <em>du jour</em>: interesting problems, smart people, good culture, etc. I imagine that very few people would argue with wanting any of the above, but I don’t think that they can be used as a framework or make the idea of work personally meaningful.</p><p>The things I’ve learned since joining Figma are certainly valuable, but even more valuable are the questions that I’ve learned to ask about myself and my relationship to work. It’s so easy to get hyper-focused on solutions (after all, problem-solving is supposedly the impetus of engineering as a discipline!) that we forget that there’s so much more power in determining which questions get asked. Rather than giving you a set of boxes to check, I’m going to share a framework for approaching your job search. While it won’t answer all of your questions, it will nudge you to reflect on your non-negotiables and nice-to-haves in a job, and how to think about work in the context of everything else.</p><h2 id="the-mythical-work-life"><a href="#the-mythical-work-life">The mythical work-life</a></h2><p>I think one of the reasons why it’s so difficult to meaningfully talk about adult life (especially about adult working life) is that a lot of the common discourse is so unhelpful. Take, for example, the concept of work-life balance. If the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=work-life+balance&amp;tbm=isch">Google image search results</a> for the term are to be trusted, the common mental model for work-life balance is some kind of teeter-totter on which the directly opposing aspects of work and life are balanced over a fulcrum. While this idea makes intuitive sense, it’s reductive and ultimately misleading.</p><p>It is true that there is such a thing as achieving a balance between the time that you spend at work and the time you spend outside of work, but framing life and work as two parts of a zero-sum game obscures the very nature of work and life itself. Work and non-work are not two distinct entities that cancel each other out. In fact almost the opposite is true: the hours you spend at work and outside of work amount to how you spend your life. Work and life are interdependent—rather than mutually exclusive—factors that affect not only your life as a whole, but also each other. </p><p>Some people tie their identity to their work more closely than others, and there’s obviously no right or wrong way to go about doing that. In any case, it would disingenuous to say that you’ve achieved the right work-life balance simply by identifying the right number of hours to spend at work. Work is not a hermetically sealed and timeboxed activity which can be treated as independent from the rest of your life — your satisfaction with the work that you do affects your satisfaction in the rest of your life, and vice versa. </p><p>I should acknowledge that no one is in complete control of all the circumstances of their work, and some have even less control than others. Toni Morrison’s essay, “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/06/05/the-work-you-do-the-person-you-are">The Work You Do, The Person You Are</a>,” presents a relationship between work and life that stems from a demeaning job she had as a child, and the conclusion, the mantra “Go to work. Get your money. And come on home,” is a reflection of those conditions. It has always been a badge of privilege to be able to think of work as not simply a job but part of a career, and especially in times of economic hardship when employment is by no means a guarantee, a career seems more precious than ever. Regardless of our circumstances, we each face the same question: how do we frame our work relative to our lives in a way that allows us to live the way we want?</p><p>For those of us who have the privilege to, this means asking questions like: what kinds of work am I interested in and how does this workplace satisfy those interests? In this work environment, how would I go about learning or developing my interests? Do I see my interests changing, and if so, do I think my work could adapt to accommodate my interests? What skills or crafts does this work afford me the opportunity to develop, and in what ways? What other interests does my work allow me to cultivate?</p><h2 id="the-more-things-change"><a href="#the-more-things-change">The more things change</a></h2><p>Joining Figma as a new grad, I had lots of opportunities to learn new things. There were, of course, the new technical experiences; Figma introduced me to doing full-stack work and writing C++ for the web. But more importantly, I got the opportunity to really own features and participate in the product development process: what it takes to thoughtfully scope and build a feature or product, disambiguate a goal, or take an idea from inception to launch.</p><p>None of this would have been possible without the support and guidance of the people around me. The people I’ve worked with have been incredible mentors (in many cases probably without them even realizing) who have given me the opportunity to challenge myself and take ownership for the things I make. Most of the people I ate lunch with at my interview three years ago still work at Figma, and I’m still benefitting from their generosity and expertise. </p><p>Of course, the Figma I work at today is different from the company I joined two years ago. Within that time, both the company and the product have grown tremendously, and we’ve started transitioning toward a <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-work-is-changing-at-figma/">hybrid model</a> of remote and in-person work. But after all this time, the things that first me excited to come to work continue to be true, and I’ve haven’t stopped learning since I got here.</p><h2 id="parting-words"><a href="#parting-words">Parting words</a></h2><p>I really only have one concrete piece of advice to offer prospective grads: get a hobby. School for me was a blur of fevered activity, constantly running (often literally) from one thing to the next. Working life is starkly simple in comparison, and for the first couple of weeks after work, the question of what to do with my free time stared me in the face. It was one thing to not be used to having so much time to myself, but it was another thing to be clueless about how to use it once I got it back.</p><p>After all, isn&#39;t free time by its very nature empowering? Invigorating? Life-affirming? Shouldn&#39;t I have felt all the endless potential of my newfound adulthood and independence? </p><p>In Franz Kafka&#39;s novel <em>Amerika</em> there&#39;s a scene in which the protagonist, Karl, a European immigrant who has just arrived in America, is being hounded by two swindlers who promise to find him a job but only end up pilfering his belongings and eating his food. At one point he manages to elude them by ducking into the office of a nearby hotel, where Karl encounters a cook who asks him:</p><div><blockquote><p>&#34;So then you’re free?&#34;</p><p>&#34;Yes, I’m free,&#34; said Karl, and nothing seemed more worthless than his freedom.</p></blockquote></div><p>After leaving school, I found in some ways I was more lost than ever. This freedom, however, only felt worthless to me because I wasn’t used to having &#34;nothing&#34; as a thing in itself, and so I perceived it as a lack. As I adjusted to my new life, however, I realized that this freedom is really the <em>tabula rasa</em> on which we begin the long and difficult process of inscribing our own meaning.</p><p>Looking for the right hobby is a lot like looking for the right job (with a lot lower stakes): different hobbies afford different experiences (creating, exploring, learning, etc.), and it’s totally up to you to define what you get out of a hobby at any given point in time. Like searching for a job, finding the right hobby isn’t necessarily easy or quick, but don’t sweat it. For the first time in a long time, there’s no rush.</p><p><em>If any of this resonates with you, learn more about Figma and <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">check out our open roles here</a></em>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The many dimensions of trust in design</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/the-many-dimensions-of-trust-in-design/</link>
      <description>How trust powers open design, and more takeaways from Config Europe</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, nearly 10,000 of you from 100 countries came together at <a href="https://config.figma.com/">Config Europe</a>, Figma’s first virtual user conference. Instead of dictating an agenda of talks and sessions, we relied on you to submit your ideas. Across the twenty-two breakout sessions with tactical tips and case studies, guides and how-to’s, one theme emerged as a north star: <em>trust</em>. </p><p>As our CEO Dylan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWy4fB3G9Gc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=122">shared in the keynote</a>, we at Figma aim to make design more open and inclusive. But this way of working is only possible with a culture of trust. Below, we’ve curated some of our favorite takeaways from Config Europe on the importance of trust amongst teammates, with clients, and in the broader design community.</p><h2 id="building-strong-relationships"><a href="#building-strong-relationships">Building strong relationships</a></h2><p>Trust begins with understanding your teammates and connecting with them on a human level. <a href="https://twitter.com/olgasaysstuff">Olga Mishyna</a>, Lead Product Designer at Adyen, suggests that it’s not just about building relationships with immediate teammates, but everyone involved in product development. “To understand what other people think, want, do—or expect you to do—we need to talk to each other,” she says. At Adyen, that can be as simple as making time for brief catch-ups before or after scheduled meetings, or hopping on a quick call instead of problem-solving over email. (If you&#39;re looking for an activity to do with your team, <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/768174747850641472">this toolkit from Dropbox</a> has some exercises to get the conversation going.)</p><p>It’s so much easier to work together once you&#39;ve built a foundation of trust, and that extends to giving and receiving feedback. Designers want to know that feedback in a design crit “comes from a place of care and support,” Olga says. The only way to do that is to build a culture in which team members assume positive intent; if someone doesn’t feel like feedback is coming from a good place, they’re more likely to get defensive. The team at Adyen feel like they can be honest and direct because they’ve invested in getting to know each other, their working styles, and the challenges they face. “Empathy is a very powerful tool,” she says.</p><h2 id="embracing-in-progress-work"><a href="#embracing-in-progress-work">Embracing in-progress work</a></h2><p>At design and development agency The Techno Creatives, communication is key. “If you improve your communication skills, you can improve your trust with clients,” says Digital Product Designer <a href="https://twitter.com/daanhekking?lang=en">Daan Hekking</a>. For Daan, it’s about establishing and communicating operating processes with teammates and clients alike. </p><p>Working with clients in Figma can take some getting used to. Once a client has access to a file, they can follow along as the designs evolve. While these real-time updates are helpful for keeping everyone on the same page (literally), it can also be scary to get feedback on early explorations. When collaborating in one file, Daan urges the team to “treat it delicately and set rules.” This means asking designers to be clear on where they are in the design process (with <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/823272326227655373">status annotations</a>, for example), whether or not input is welcome, and if so, the altitude of feedback they need to move forward. </p><p>Since design is iterative by nature and work evolves constantly, keeping clients and the internal team up to date is key: “Make sure that your doc reflects the current state of the project,” Daan says. As you think about establishing these types of operating rules on your team, <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/826849235179549507">this file from Mixpanel</a> is a great place to start.</p><h2 id="opening-the-dialogue"><a href="#opening-the-dialogue">Opening the dialogue</a></h2><p>Beyond the day-to-day work, <a href="https://twitter.com/yessshir">Shirley Lai</a>, Product Designer at Rakuten Viki, hopes that teams can have open conversations about the bigger picture as well. Shirley created <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/877214754445470023">The Designated Dissenter</a> card game to empower everyone—regardless of role or seniority—to speak up about design ethics and the role of technology. </p><p>Broken up into “stakeholders,” “values,” and “discussion,” the game assigns a “dissenter,” whose job is to object and oppose what others on the team say. “It’s a way to get to know your team better and foster an open feedback culture,” Shirley says. And more importantly, it’ll get the team to think about the “larger consequences” of what they’re building, on a more foundational level.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="ed4LDaqfKSYX" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Building trust with colleagues and clients won’t happen overnight, but taking time to get to know one another, establish clear processes, and have honest conversations with your team will set you on the right path.</p><p>If you’re curious to hear more from Config Europe, subscribe to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQsVmhSa4X-G3lHlUtejzLA">Figma’s YouTube channel</a> to get notified when we publish all of the breakout sessions.

      <title>Embracing the tension between code and design</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/config-europe-2020-new-feature-announcements/</link>
      <description>New features that bring the best of both worlds to design systems in Figma</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a natural tension between design and code. In the world of design, the focus is deciding what to build—in the world of code, the focus is building it.</p><p>Traditionally, designers and developers have occupied different worlds, requiring separate tools. In practice, they’re partners working to bring a product to life. While their approaches may differ, each offer unique advantages. Designers optimize for freeform, creative exploration, while developers take a more structured approach. The result is an inevitable tension between the two: what feels like “breaking” a component to a developer is just creative exploration to a designer; what reads as “structure” to a developer might be inhibiting to a designer. </p><p>We believe in embracing concepts from engineering and design, adopting the rigor and reusability of code while preserving the rapid iteration and uninhibited exploration that makes visual design so powerful. </p><p>At <a href="https://config.figma.com/">Config Europe</a> this morning, we announced several new features that will carry the best of both worlds to design systems in Figma—bringing them closer to code and making them intuitive to use, while more efficiently translating designs into production.</p><h2 id="supporting-design-systems-that-mirror-your-code"><a href="#supporting-design-systems-that-mirror-your-code">Supporting design systems that mirror your code base</a></h2><p>Teams typically maintain a set of components for design, and one for development. While this is a normal and good approach, straddling both worlds isn’t always easy. When code and design components mirror each other, teams can move much more efficiently. Today, we announced Variants, Interactive Components, and improvements to Auto Layout that will allow teams to do just that.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="bridging-code-and-design-components-with-variants"><a href="#bridging-code-and-design-components-with-variants">Bridging code and design components with Variants (coming in November)</a></h3><p>A single component in front-end code typically renders in a number of visual styles, for different contexts and states of user interaction. For example, a button might have primary and secondary styles, small and large sizes, and different versions for iOS and Android. Currently, a button component like this would be represented by different components, each for a different visual style. This mismatch between design and code can result in miscommunication, ultimately slowing down the development process.</p><p>To solve this problem, we’re launching <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055471353-Prepare-for-Variants">Variants</a>, a way to logically group together variations of the same component into a single, more powerful component. In addition to simplifying the asset panel, this update will allow components to map more closely to code.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="drag-and-drop-interactive-components-into"><a href="#drag-and-drop-interactive-components-into">Drag and drop Interactive Components into prototypes (launching in January)</a></h3><p>Now that you’re able to group a component’s interactive states together with Variants, you may be wondering whether or not these interactive states work with your prototypes.</p><p>While Variants let us group a component’s states together, prototyping the transitions between these states in Figma today still requires a lot of work. Just to create the illusion of an interactive object, designers would have to connect multiple frames with overlays.</p><p>Interactive Components make prototyping much more efficient by letting designers add prototyping interactions between Variants, so instances are immediately “alive” in prototyping mode. </p><figure></figure><h3 id="design-like-you-code-with-auto-layout-coming-in"><a href="#design-like-you-code-with-auto-layout-coming-in">Design like you code with Auto Layout (coming in November)</a></h3><p>The introduction of Auto Layout in 2019 brought layout rules to Figma. By allowing designers to make updates to button text without manually adjusting frame size, Auto Layout empowers them to more easily create responsive interfaces. But we knew we had more work ahead of us to bring Auto Layout even closer to how the CSS <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">box model</a> and <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">Flexbox</a> work on the Web. </p><p>In our next evolution, we’re bringing a simplified UI to Auto Layout so it’s even easier to use, plus new features based on some of our most frequent requests: the ability to stretch elements along both axes, configure independent padding values, and optimize spacing for common UI patterns like navigation icons.   </p><h2 id="making-design-systems-more-accessible-at-scale"><a href="#making-design-systems-more-accessible-at-scale">Making design systems more accessible at scale</a></h2><p>In addition to making design systems more powerful, we’ve added features that help both designers and developers navigate large, complex libraries. </p><figure></figure><p>When you’re navigating thousands of components, finding the right one was previously a clunky experience in Figma. You’d have to remember the exact component name or scan a giant list. In addition to Variants, which will reduce the number of components designers need to look through, we’ve overhauled the <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039150413">Instance Swap Menu</a> so that it scales with your design system. You can now use thumbnails, keyboard shortcuts, and search to find the component you’re looking for. </p><figure></figure><h3 id="copy-paste-and-code-with-the-new-inspect-tab-live"><a href="#copy-paste-and-code-with-the-new-inspect-tab-live">Copy, paste, and code with the new Inspect Tab (live now)</a></h3><p>When it comes time to implement designs, developers need to find the right information. The new <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055203533">Inspect Tab</a> replaces the Code panel and provides more relevant properties developers can grab. The name of the selected layer is shown right at the top to help designers and developers get on the same page about what’s being implemented. And there are new sections showing relevant values for Variants, Colors, Shadows, Content, Typography, Borders, and more. It also lets developers click to copy any value to their clipboard—including whole snippets of key:value pairs—so they can easily paste things into code.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="SLX2X-_73bWN" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>These updates are just the start of how we envision bringing design and code closer together in Figma. There are times when a designer needs a free and unrestrained canvas to work in, and there are times when a more structured code-inspired approach is the fastest way for a designer to work. We imagine a world where designers can move smoothly between those two ways of working as they see fit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>On pitching and presenting</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/on-pitching-and-presenting/</link>
      <description>How to create and deliver a great presentation</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Abigail Africa, one of Figma&#39;s inaugural Student Fellows, is <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/an-open-letter-about-my-gap-year/">currently taking a gap year</a> from <a href="https://iovine-young.usc.edu/about/index.html">USC&#39;s Iovine &amp; Young Academy</a>, where she&#39;ll resume classes as a senior next fall. The program, which focuses on the interplay between design, technology, and entrepreneurship, invites students to take on design strategy clients for all four years and culminates in seniors running their own startups. Since presenting is a large part of both client-facing work and startup-building, Abigail spent the first three years of college refining her presentation skills in front of a variety of audiences: toy designers, vehicle inventors, entertainment executives, and more. Below, she shares her tips for developing and delivering a presentation that lands.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="r8Oc6w4KX0Ul" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>On the first day of college, the dean of my program brought all the freshmen to hear from a Silicon Valley Bank investor, then informed us that we’d be presenting to him immediately after. With just an hour to prepare a pitch on Pet Rocks, I did what was familiar: cited market statistics, researched the history of the toy, and made what I thought were a few clever points about how nostalgia drives sales. </p><p>No dice. The investor smiled blankly and moved on to the next presentation, crowning a group of my classmates as the winners. &#34;It&#39;s pretty simple,&#34; he said. &#34;Some of you created apps to accompany the Pet Rocks, and some of you pitched big marketing campaigns. Only one group told a story.&#34; </p><p>I used to think that storytelling was reserved for social situations, like making my friends laugh or carrying the conversation at a dinner party. In spending the last three years presenting my ideas to design clients and preparing to pitch a startup, I know now that storytelling also has an important place in my coursework and the professional world.  Whether you’re presenting in class, running a team meeting, or looking for a new job, great storytelling can help you present clear ideas, pitch solutions to complex problems, or carry an interview. </p><p>While many of us assume that storytelling is an innate ability, I’ve since learned that it’s a skill that you can refine and perfect over time. Here, I’m sharing what I’ve learned along the way, including how to develop the three main pieces of a presentation: what you say, how you say it, and crafting visuals to bring your ideas to life. </p><h2 id="content-what-you-say"><a href="#content-what-you-say">Content: what you say</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/664c20ac5d425e4df8200bd4210d79caec0a4649-1600x527.png?rect=1,0,1598,527&amp;w=670&amp;h=221&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/664c20ac5d425e4df8200bd4210d79caec0a4649-1600x527.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/664c20ac5d425e4df8200bd4210d79caec0a4649-1600x527.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/664c20ac5d425e4df8200bd4210d79caec0a4649-1600x527.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/664c20ac5d425e4df8200bd4210d79caec0a4649-1600x527.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/664c20ac5d425e4df8200bd4210d79caec0a4649-1600x527.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Visuals and presentation style certainly matter (more on that below!), but they’re in service of the story you’re telling. What you say is the most important part.</p><h3 id="building-audience-trust"><a href="#building-audience-trust">Building audience trust</a></h3><p>Before I start developing a presentation, I take a quick account of who might be in the room. Building trust is central to making an audience think, act, or feel differently, and to do that, you have to show your audience that you understand them. Here are some questions that I try to answer as I prepare presentations:</p><ul><li>What do they care about? Consider their challenges, needs, and goals.</li><li>Why are they listening to your pitch?</li><li>What do they have to gain?</li><li>How do they communicate? Is there industry-specific language I need to incorporate?</li></ul><h3 id="structuring-your-story"><a href="#structuring-your-story">Structuring your story</a></h3><p>My presentations usually hinge on a story that shows the audience that I truly understand them. To that end, I learn everything I can about who might be in the room, articulate a problem statement that resonates with them, and introduce the solution. To frame the problem statement, my design strategy professor recommends completing this sentence: &#34;A [stakeholder] who feels [feeling] about [a task] needs to [act] but [faces an obstacle].&#34; </p><p>Then, introduce your solution, reinforcing how it solves the problem as you explain how it works. It&#39;s helpful to recycle language from your problem description into this section, or recall characters or events from early examples. End on a Call-To-Action (CTA) that asks the audience to act in a certain way: approve your project for further exploration, fund your work, provide mentorship, or even think differently.</p><h2 id="delivery-how-you-say-it"><a href="#delivery-how-you-say-it">Delivery: how you say it</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f22c0c1c718fb1002c81db06742390aaaea7cca5-1600x527.png?rect=1,0,1598,527&amp;w=670&amp;h=221&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f22c0c1c718fb1002c81db06742390aaaea7cca5-1600x527.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f22c0c1c718fb1002c81db06742390aaaea7cca5-1600x527.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f22c0c1c718fb1002c81db06742390aaaea7cca5-1600x527.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f22c0c1c718fb1002c81db06742390aaaea7cca5-1600x527.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f22c0c1c718fb1002c81db06742390aaaea7cca5-1600x527.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>While your words make your visuals matter, your tone, demeanor, and how you hold yourself can transform a series of slides into a convincing pitch.</p><h3 id="raise-and-lower-your-voice"><a href="#raise-and-lower-your-voice">Raise (and lower) your voice</a></h3><p>After listening to my own recordings, I learned that my voice inflects less drastically than most others&#39; voices, even when I&#39;m really excited. In-person, I psych myself up a little bit: I drink coffee right beforehand, wear heels that make me stand up taller, and shake out my limbs in the bathroom. During the presentation, I gesture with my hands, let my feet move around, and lean forward when I need to emphasize something. </p><p>Humans like to mirror authentic emotion, so if the audience feels your excitement, it’s more likely that they’ll be engaged as well. As you get subtle feedback from your audience—based on eye contact and body language—you can adjust your presentation style accordingly. If it seems like people in the room are zoning out, that might be a cue to change things up: move around the room, speak a little louder, or try to make eye contact with a couple people in the audience.  </p><h3 id="adjusting-to-virtual-presentation-mode"><a href="#adjusting-to-virtual-presentation-mode">Adjusting to virtual presentation mode</a></h3><p>Presenting remotely can be daunting. Beyond the potential for technical difficulties, you might find that your usual voice intonation and hand gestures don’t translate as well virtually. To see what I&#39;m talking about, try spending five minutes reading aloud to yourself in private, recording your voice. Listen to your recording, and you&#39;ll have a sense for what the audience hears when you’re presenting. </p><p>Whether it’s an internet hiccup or participants have their video and audio turned off, video conferencing limits presenters’ access to immediate emotional feedback from the audience. Here are a few ways I adjust to Zoom meetings:</p><ul><li>Stand while you present (you can stack your computer up on some books)</li><li>Pin your video to the screen and amp yourself up by watching your own performance</li><li>Add sticky notes to your computer reminding yourself to smile and raise your eyebrows</li></ul><h3 id="repeat-yourself"><a href="#repeat-yourself">Repeat yourself</a></h3><p>When I first started presenting, my dad told me that he repeats himself three times whenever he has something he really wants to drive in during a sales pitch. To make things more cohesive and memorable, pair verbal repetition with visual motifs—small tweaks to the same repeated diagram, repeat images, or repeat words on the screen.</p><h3 id="dress-for-movement"><a href="#dress-for-movement">Dress for movement</a></h3><p>Wear comfortable, flexible clothing so that you can move and gesture in it without worry.

Slides should illustrate your argument, add meaning, and anchor your audience&#39;s attention in evidence or examples that support your speech. I build my decks in Figma, where I can manipulate and replicate design elements across slides in a few clicks. Components, set colors, and set styles are great tools for efficient slide design, especially when I work on decks with others.</p><h3 id="slide-simplicity"><a href="#slide-simplicity">Slide simplicity</a></h3><p>There&#39;s a design principle called visual economy that basically means useful simplicity, cutting out everything that distracts from the essential parts. This has been one of the most consistently useful guiding principles for me over the past few years. Your visuals do not need to be wildly artistic or complex. Below is a slide I used in a recent presentation on writing:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/def30b75218af978d5115dc7546da59709ac53cf-1600x898.png?w=670&amp;h=376&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/def30b75218af978d5115dc7546da59709ac53cf-1600x898.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/def30b75218af978d5115dc7546da59709ac53cf-1600x898.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/def30b75218af978d5115dc7546da59709ac53cf-1600x898.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/def30b75218af978d5115dc7546da59709ac53cf-1600x898.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/def30b75218af978d5115dc7546da59709ac53cf-1600x898.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Since I had a lot to get through in the talk track, I wanted the accompanying visual to be simple and relevant.</p><p>While simple is usually better, that doesn&#39;t always mean fewer slides.

If you choose to have repeated elements on every slide (page numbers, subtitles, etc.), make sure that they&#39;re in the same position from slide to slide, pixel to pixel. In addition to distracting the audience, spacing that looks even a little off can make the presentation feel less polished. </p><p>Here&#39;s an example of what it looks like to set consistent margins and spacing in a slide. My favorite way to enforce margins is to create a slide template with a built-in rectangular clipping mask to crop the margins automatically:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f8bff02b4ee544dfd535d6b6f2944834bada343-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f8bff02b4ee544dfd535d6b6f2944834bada343-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f8bff02b4ee544dfd535d6b6f2944834bada343-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f8bff02b4ee544dfd535d6b6f2944834bada343-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f8bff02b4ee544dfd535d6b6f2944834bada343-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f8bff02b4ee544dfd535d6b6f2944834bada343-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="typography"><a href="#typography">Typography</a></h3><p>Excellent typography sets great presentations apart from good ones! Here are the basics: </p><ul><li>A distinct typeface can give your presentation a lot of character, but readability is your top priority (before you make any final decisions about your typography, see the next section on accessibility).</li><li>Even if you don&#39;t own any typefaces, a few hours&#39; research on free web fonts can help your typography go from generic to polished. An old design trick is to mix two typefaces; <a href="https://www.typewolf.com/blog/google-fonts-combinations">Typewolf</a> is great for helping you find perfect pairs.</li><li>For deeper dives: there are <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/typography">free type courses</a> online and a few <a href="https://medium.com/web-typography-news/learning-typography-introduction-resources-d992d1a82ea2">good Medium publications</a> that cover the fascinating world of type.</li><li>If you&#39;re looking for a great free sans-serif font, check out <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/rsms">Rasmus Andersson</a>, a previous Figmate. Inter is a beautiful typeface that&#39;s already built into Figma and Google Docs through OpenType.</li><li>Speaking of OpenType, Figma’s resident typography enthusiast, Marcin Wichary, wrote an <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/opentype-font-features/">ode to OpenType</a>—it&#39;s a great place to dive in.</li></ul><h3 id="accessibility"><a href="#accessibility">Accessibility</a></h3><p>Accessibility is key, and there are many guides out there (like <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/11/inclusive-design-accessible-presentations/">this one</a>) on accessibility in presentation design. Here are some other guidelines to get you started:</p><ul><li>If you&#39;re presenting in a classroom, raise the text contrast across your slides and underexpose your images.</li><li>Sunny rooms fade projections and add glare to LED displays, so black will look gray, white won&#39;t be bright, dark colors will look diluted, and bright colors will look like pastels.</li><li>If you&#39;re presenting in a large room like a lecture hall or a long conference room, where it may be difficult to see the screen properly, you can share a link to view the presentation before jumping in, so that people can follow along on their own devices.</li></ul><p>If you&#39;re giving a virtual presentation, you have a little more leeway, because people can customize their viewing experience and read at a close distance. Just make sure to check in at the beginning of the presentation to ensure that everyone can hear you and see your screen.</p><h3 id="imagery"><a href="#imagery">Imagery</a></h3><p>Photography, illustrations, icons, and videos can all help you tell a compelling story, but it can be overwhelming to figure out where to start. Here are some considerations:</p><ul><li>Every piece of imagery either contributes or distracts from your main story, so make sure that your images add meaning, not decoration. A common example of decorative imagery is iconography. While it&#39;s easy to gravitate toward icons because they&#39;re so present in everyday UI, remember that no one is clicking on anything in a pitch deck.</li><li>Take advantage of free design resources and <a href="https://unsplash.com/">free-use photography</a>. Figma even has a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/738454987945972471/Unsplash">plugin for this</a>! Just make sure to give credit, either by adding a caption, linking to the resource  somewhere on  your slide, or dedicating a slide at the end of your deck to citations.</li><li>Depending on your audience, they may respond well to edgier imagery. Think: memes, pop culture references, and screenshots of news articles can all work. Just make sure that your references are relevant, and when in doubt, err on the side of caution—it’s not worth alienating or offending anyone in the audience for the sake of a meme.</li></ul><h3 id="color"><a href="#color">Color</a></h3><p>In most cases, sparingly used accent colors can add polish to your slides. You can use color to highlight specific words or data points, or to help tell your story in more subtle ways: In one presentation, I changed background colors gradually to parallel an evolving concept. I&#39;ve also used accent and background colors to separate topics from one another. In some cases, decks look better with a shocking amount of color in them. Be creative and have fun with color, but make sure it doesn&#39;t interfere with readability.</p><h3 id="visualizing-data"><a href="#visualizing-data">Visualizing data</a></h3><p>Facts and figures can offer powerful supporting points. Just remember to present them in context of the broader story. As you think about what data to include, prioritize data that can be represented visually, like growth over time. For inspiration, I like to reference data-centered journalism from <a href="https://pudding.cool/"><em>The Pudding</em></a>, <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/"><em>Our World in Data</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/12/30/us/2019-year-in-graphics.html">visual stories and graphics</a> from <em>The New York Times</em>. Graphics Team, who regularly publish clear, data-oriented stories.</p><h2 id="where-to-go-from-here"><a href="#where-to-go-from-here">Where to go from here</a></h2><p>Most of us tell stories in everyday life, without even realizing it. I’ve started to be more intentional about practicing whenever I can, and I rely on these three habits: </p><h3 id="tell-stories-in-everyday-conversation"><a href="#tell-stories-in-everyday-conversation">Tell stories in everyday conversation</a></h3><p>These are some ways you might practice telling stories in different social settings: </p><ul><li>Think of every conversation as a presentation or a pitch of some idea. What storytelling structures are most successful? Why?</li><li>Even in casual conversations, pay keen attention to the person you’re talking to responds. Over time, you&#39;ll get better at reading people, and adapting your storytelling style accordingly.</li><li>Practice being precise with your words, even if it means an awkward mid-sentence pause as you find the right phrase.</li></ul><h3 id="consume-great-storytelling-regularly"><a href="#consume-great-storytelling-regularly">Consume great storytelling regularly</a></h3><p>Seek out great storytellers in podcasts, TED talks, books, and publications. Hearing from professional storytellers—writers, journalists, podcast hosts—can help you refine pacing, intonation, and structure. I like podcasts that focus on intimate storytelling (like <a href="https://thememorypalace.us/"><em>The Memory Palace</em></a> or <a href="https://www.npr.org/podcasts/469516571/modern-love"><em>Modern Love</em></a>) and publications that distill complex ideas into clear and concise writing (like <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/"><em>The Atlantic</em></a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/"><em>The New York Times</em></a>).</p><h3 id="keep-track-of-things-well-said-and-things-well"><a href="#keep-track-of-things-well-said-and-things-well">Keep track of things well said and things well presented</a></h3><p>I collect my favorite sentences and phrases in a Notion page. Beyond reminding me what “good” looks like, the document offers inspiration when I’m stuck on a word or phrase. I also dedicate a file in Figma to screenshots of slides from great visual communication, like the <a href="https://www.figma.com/@yuhki">decks and templates</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/yuhkiyam">Yuhki Yamashita</a>, VP of Product at Figma.</p><p>Remember that storytelling is a skill, and it comes with practice. Beyond the more practical tips that I shared, becoming a better storyteller is also about learning and developing your own voice. More than anything, work on finding a style and approach that feels right—whatever that looks like to you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma’s new EMEA HQ</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-new-emea-hq/</link>
      <description>We&#39;re opening an office in London to better support users in EMEA</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last month, I shared how <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-work-is-changing-at-figma/">Figma is moving to a hybrid working model</a>, offering both remote and in-person options. Part of that approach includes building out hubs, spaces of centralized work that enable us to better connect with users around the world. Today, I’m excited to announce that Figma is opening a hub office in London, which will serve as our HQ for the EMEA region. </p><p>Knowing that so many of us (including everyone at Figma) will continue to work remotely for the foreseeable future, we considered waiting to share the news until we felt comfortable welcoming Figmates back for in-person work. But the reality is that opening an office is so much more than a physical space. It’s also about sharing a time zone with more of our users, attracting diverse talent as Figma continues to grow, and understanding local nuances in order to support design communities across the world.</p><p>When we launched Figma in 2016, I was shocked at the global nature of our user base — 81% of Figma’s weekly active users are outside the United States! So I started traveling to meet with <a href="https://friends.figma.com/chapters/">Figma communities across the world</a> to learn more. Spending time with customers is one of the best parts of my job, and I’m always surprised at how much I learn about our product through engaging with our community. (I can’t wait for COVID to be over so I can get back to meeting users in person again!)</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0ce77ca650ba7277ce9a1b7e876fd44a5da1a935-1600x760.png?rect=0,0,1600,759&amp;w=670&amp;h=318&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0ce77ca650ba7277ce9a1b7e876fd44a5da1a935-1600x760.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0ce77ca650ba7277ce9a1b7e876fd44a5da1a935-1600x760.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0ce77ca650ba7277ce9a1b7e876fd44a5da1a935-1600x760.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0ce77ca650ba7277ce9a1b7e876fd44a5da1a935-1600x760.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0ce77ca650ba7277ce9a1b7e876fd44a5da1a935-1600x760.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Raphaël Guilleminot speaks at one of our earlier meetups at Deliveroo in Fall, 2018</figcaption></figure><p>As I spent time internationally, I quickly learned that our time zone coverage was inadequate for users outside the US. This resulted in us hiring an amazing team of product specialists in Amsterdam in early 2019. In addition to <a href="https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1148156156130603008?s=20">spending time with the Figma team</a> and community in Amsterdam, last year I was lucky to have the chance to meet customers in London, Paris, Helsinki, Kiev, Moscow, Jakarta, and Singapore.</p><p>Earlier this year, we decided to increase our local presence by building a London team in order to better partner with our users in the region, including forward-thinking companies like Deliveroo in London, Zalando in Berlin, Spotify in Stockholm, and Booking.com in Amsterdam. Today, we have a team of 14 working remotely in the London area, and they remind me daily how much opportunity there is for us in the region.</p><p>While we hoped to celebrate our new EMEA HQ in person, the world had other plans. We’re excited to officially open our doors as soon as it feels safe for Figmates to resume in-person work. In the meantime, we’ll be continuing the momentum another way: introducing <a href="https://config.figma.com/">Config Europe</a>, our first virtual user conference, a space for all of us to share, learn and come together. I can’t wait to see you there!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No office chair is perhaps more coveted than one from Herman Miller. </p><p>Back when browsing a brick-and-mortar store was the norm, finding the perfectly ergonomic chair called for an in-person showroom experience. But with the emergence of price sensitive direct-to-consumer websites and the rippling impacts of COVID-19, winning a consumer takes so much more than a brand name.</p><p>For one of Herman Miller’s brands, <a href="https://www.dwr.com/">Design Within Reach (DWR)</a>, this meant redesigning their e-commerce website to not just showcase beautiful products, but also tailor the shopping experience to each consumer. “The furniture industry has historically been behind consumer startups,” DWR’s Director of Digital Design Eric Ishii-Eckhardt said. “To be on par, we have to offer more consumer-centric experiences.” </p><p>To tackle this redesign, the DWR team partnered with <a href="https://www.basicagency.com/">BASIC®</a>, a branding and digital agency that works with companies like Google, Airbnb, Patagonia, Apple, and Beats by Dre. &#34;To succeed, we have to work with people who’ve worked with the best consumer brands,&#34; Ishii-Eckhardt said. &#34;Working with BASIC® gave us the best of both worlds—the e-commerce expertise of an agency and the in-house knowledge of the DWR team.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e6a7b3e825869e17cfbe4d2e09503e0668a0224-1600x900.jpg?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e6a7b3e825869e17cfbe4d2e09503e0668a0224-1600x900.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e6a7b3e825869e17cfbe4d2e09503e0668a0224-1600x900.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e6a7b3e825869e17cfbe4d2e09503e0668a0224-1600x900.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e6a7b3e825869e17cfbe4d2e09503e0668a0224-1600x900.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e6a7b3e825869e17cfbe4d2e09503e0668a0224-1600x900.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The newly redesigned DesignWithinReach.com launched July 2020</figcaption></figure><h3 id="a-true-agency-partnership-starts-with-a"><a href="#a-true-agency-partnership-starts-with-a">A true agency partnership starts with a transparent process</a></h3><p>Building a great relationship between a client and their agency is easier said than done. To ensure their relationship was rooted in trust and transparency, the DWR and BASIC® teams created a tightly integrated process. &#34;Instead of separate workstreams, we established a partnership built around the idea of co-creation and leveraged different aspects of our teams’ expertise,” said BASIC® CEO Matt Faulk. “When it came time to design and build, we operated as one singular team.”</p><p>Operating as a singular team called for a more transparent way of working. “We were already struggling with design file collaboration among our internal product design team,” DWR’s UI Design Lead Ryan Ganss said. “Working with designers at a different company was going to add to that challenge. We needed to change our design tool so our two teams could actually work together in real-time. Figma was that change.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23b84777f090c901c311ff5d5c7a3b62b931fca4-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23b84777f090c901c311ff5d5c7a3b62b931fca4-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23b84777f090c901c311ff5d5c7a3b62b931fca4-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23b84777f090c901c311ff5d5c7a3b62b931fca4-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23b84777f090c901c311ff5d5c7a3b62b931fca4-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/23b84777f090c901c311ff5d5c7a3b62b931fca4-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Teams from both companies joined a shared Figma account to design together</figcaption></figure><p>Because Figma is built on the web, the DWR and BASIC® teams could access design files at all times. “Both teams were able to work in the same file without worrying about copying over each other,” said BASIC® Senior Designer Garret Schauteet. “This unlocked a whole new level of efficiency. With two teams based in different time zones, we essentially achieved 14-hour workdays. At the end of our workday, the DWR team can just pick up where we left off. We didn’t have to worry about handing off the latest version or updating links.”</p><figure><figcaption>The DWR and BASIC®  teams performed hours of user testing using Figma prototypes</figcaption></figure><h3 id="bringing-the-showroom-experience-to-the-web"><a href="#bringing-the-showroom-experience-to-the-web">Bringing the showroom experience to the web</a></h3><p>The new DWR.com came to life after 110 hours of customer research and in-depth user testing with more than 200 participants. As more consumers make buying decisions entirely online these days, the goal of the new website redesign was to answer customers’ key shopping questions, replicating the experience they might have in a showroom.</p><p>“Using Figma prototypes for usability testing, we were able to run tests, iterate quickly, and keep moving forward,” UX Designer Raechel MacKenzie said. “We quickly gathered insights using an interactive website prototype that looked and felt like the real thing.”</p><p>The new website launched in early July 2020 with a fully responsive design and video chat to get in touch with sales associates. Since launch, DWR is seeing an increase in sales, as shoppers who use the new live chat functions are nine times more likely to make an online purchase compared with those who don’t.</p><p>“We typically anticipate a small drop after a big website release, but instead we saw an immediate lift in site purchase,” Ishii-Eckhardt said. “Internally, I’ve never seen so much positive feedback from all across the organization. I believe one of the reasons for this was the transparent process we ran. Along the way, I was able to easily share quick links to Figma prototypes with our CEO and other execs, so they were part of our journey.”</p><h3 id="a-design-system-that-scales-across-multiple-brands"><a href="#a-design-system-that-scales-across-multiple-brands">A design system that scales across multiple brands</a></h3><p>But what makes the DWR and BASIC® teams proudest actually lies beneath the glossy redesign. “We used the DWR website redesign as an opportunity to create our first design system for all of Herman Miller brands,” Mackenzie said. “BASIC® helped to evolve and define the new art direction of the system. Building upon a shared core set of components, the two teams created a structure that would scale over time.” </p><p>For DWR, this new design system not only helps their developers implement repeatable components faster, but it now allows content authors to quickly build a page by simply dragging in pre-built components, editing images, and changing text—democratizing design across their whole organization. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6419db8970e74577300c6d41aefedb44491df02b-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6419db8970e74577300c6d41aefedb44491df02b-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6419db8970e74577300c6d41aefedb44491df02b-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6419db8970e74577300c6d41aefedb44491df02b-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6419db8970e74577300c6d41aefedb44491df02b-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6419db8970e74577300c6d41aefedb44491df02b-1600x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>DWR’s component library will serve as the design system foundation for the rest of Herman Miller’s brands</figcaption></figure><p>“We now have a common design language for the Herman Miller family of brands,” Ishii-Eckhardt said. “With our asset libraries all in the cloud in Figma, we’ll be able to easily share and scale our design system with our internal and external partners around the world.” </p><p>As the Herman Miller teams set their sight on redesigning their other e-commerce sites, getting that coveted in-store experience from the comforts of our home will soon be just a few clicks away.</p><p>In the meantime, explore the new website at <a href="https://www.dwr.com/">www.DWR.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Learnings about building and maintaining design systems</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A few months back, leaders from Shopify, Condé Nast, and Harry’s <a href="https://youtu.be/tuKjwceTvDM?t=4">shared their experiences</a> creating multi-brand design systems. When done well, design systems enable consistency and efficiency; as so many of us continue to work remotely, it’s more important than ever to get everyone on the same page. We&#39;ve curated some of the highlights from the livestream that apply to remote work and beyond. Check out the video:</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="dhVcNz8xsn4j" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Design systems have come a long way from pattern libraries and sticker sheets. Now, they&#39;re living systems with code counterparts, and they’ve really changed how we do our work for the better. Beyond providing consistency by creating a set of standard designs and components, they empower teams to move faster and more efficiently. </p><h2 id="flexibility-not-rigidity"><a href="#flexibility-not-rigidity">Flexibility, not rigidity</a></h2><p>Since design systems can be a single source of truth for your team, it can be tempting to come up with a set of hard and fast rules around not only what goes into your design system, but also how to use it. While it’s important to provide a solid structure, being too prescriptive can impede creativity, and ultimately might make designers feel like they need to go outside of the system.</p><p>For <a href="https://twitter.com/MCapoz">Mae Capozzi</a>, a former Senior Software Engineer at Harry’s, it&#39;s about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuKjwceTvDM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3080">trading complexity for flexibility</a>. The team at Harry’s does that by building in layers, which are architected from least complex and least flexible (e.g. base components) to most complex and most flexible (e.g. starter kit), allowing designers to build something more standard or to explore a new approach. While the simple layers suffice for most projects, others will require something more custom, which the design system can flex to support. By defaulting to simple while allowing for more complicated builds, the system optimizes for efficiency and ensures that designers don’t feel the need to leave the system. </p><p>Since Condé Nast oversee publications like <em>Vogue</em>, <em>The New Yorker</em>, and <em>Bon Appétit</em>, it’s crucial that their design system can flex to the needs of different brands. <a href="https://twitter.com/codingdesigner?lang=en">Mason Wendell</a>, frontend developer at Condé Nast says the team does this by building <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuKjwceTvDM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1570">modular, adaptable components</a> through a token system. A single token can hold a different value for each brand, allowing the system to scale across brands easily. For example, the token “prominent text” refers to a different font for each brand.</p><h2 id="always-evolving"><a href="#always-evolving">Always evolving</a></h2><p>The work doesn’t stop once you’ve built a design system that fits your team’s needs. Once you implement a system, you’ll learn what’s working and what’s not, identify what needs to evolve, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-design-system-analytics/">better understand usage</a>. The best design systems are easy to change and experiment with, and the companies that can evolve the fastest will be the ones who have the best results.</p><p>For the team at Shopify, it’s about providing a foundation that will “bend but not break.” As UX Manager <a href="https://twitter.com/iamrvazquez?lang=en">Ricardo Vazquez</a> shares, the problem is when teams make “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuKjwceTvDM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=817">museum quality</a>” systems that are treated as artifacts, and they’re afraid to make changes as their use cases and needs evolve.</p><p>“It’s imperative for us to observe,” Ricardo says. Not just designers, but also end users—in Shopify’s case, merchants. “<a href="https://youtu.be/tuKjwceTvDM?t=755">Watch how it breaks</a> in order to reinvent it.”</p><h2 id="connection-to-code"><a href="#connection-to-code">Connection to code</a></h2><p>While components are rooted in design, finding ways to translate those components to code will enable you to move much faster and more efficiently.</p><p>Condé Nast’s site is run in javascript, enabling them to use a token system that is defined in JSON. The team has built a custom plugin that allows for importing and exporting changes to token values in JSON format. Mason says that this token system allows the team to “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuKjwceTvDM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2316">stand up a new market quickly</a>,” and ensures a smooth handoff between designers and engineers.</p><p>But it doesn’t have to be complex. Mason says that if you <a href="https://youtu.be/tuKjwceTvDM?t=2733">don’t have multiple brands</a>, you can at least start by associating “a purpose with a value.” Whether it’s colors or typography, doing so will give you a sense of how complex your system is. “By settling on names and values, that gives you some perspective on how complex—or overly-complex—your design system might currently be.”</p><p>Above all, it’s important to build a system and processes that work best for your team’s size, structure, and priorities. As Mae reminds us, “I really don’t think that there is a <a href="https://youtu.be/tuKjwceTvDM?t=2931">one-size-fits-all solution</a>.”</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="aTebPMFUTmih" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em>For all the learnings and best practices, <a href="https://youtu.be/tuKjwceTvDM?t=4">watch the full livestream</a>.

      <title>Inside Figma: enterprise, explained</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-enterprise-explained/</link>
      <description>A behind-the-scenes look at Figma’s enterprise product team</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Since <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-organization/">Figma Organization first launched</a> just over a year and a half ago, we’ve been committed to building a tool that supports companies of all sizes. Engineer Aashima Garg shares an inside look at Figma’s enterprise team and the work they do, spotlighting a recent project to improve the Organization admin experience. She dives into how they understand complex users, build partnerships with cross-functional teams, and why Figma’s approach to enterprise is a little different.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="-j2OgssFS9jR" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>“Enterprise” means so many different things at different companies. A common misconception I often hear is that enterprise product roadmaps are always dictated top-down: customers request something, and we build it. In reality, developing a product that scales well, supports a wide range of customers, and delivers a delightful experience is so much more complex (and interesting!) than just shipping the most recent request. </p><p>Figma’s enterprise product team develops tooling that helps Organization admins manage their accounts and ensure that designers, developers, and collaborators have the access they need. Day to day, that involves joining sales calls with prospective clients to learn about their needs, meeting with existing customers to gather feedback, and partnering with stakeholders across marketing, engineering, and design to build cohesive solutions. </p><h2 id="our-complex-and-interesting-work"><a href="#our-complex-and-interesting-work">Our complex (and interesting!) work</a></h2><p>Since launching <a href="https://www.figma.com/organization/">Figma Organization</a> in early 2019, Figma’s usage within our existing customers has grown immensely. Especially in our new remote world, it’s more important than ever for everyone involved in the product development process to be on the same page, and we often see that happening in Figma. But as more and more collaborators join Figma to participate and contribute to their company’s design process, the scope of an Organization admin’s work in Figma broadens.</p><p>Figma’s original Admin Settings console was designed before we knew what tooling would be most valuable to admins. Now, over a year into the product’s life, we’ve learned a lot more about who our customers are and what they need. Through conversations with customers, support, and sales, we started to understand what worked well, what didn’t, and what admins need to efficiently do their jobs. It became clear that our customers had outgrown the Admin Settings&#39; original design.</p><p>So, we set out to redesign it.  </p><h2 id="starting-from-first-principles"><a href="#starting-from-first-principles">Starting from first principles</a></h2><p>We knew that Figma worked well for designers, but for admins who manage their team’s day-to-day operation, there was room for improvement. We decided to reimagine Figma for our admin users, optimize their member management workflows, highlight existing functionality, and leave room to allow us to more easily build new features in the future. </p><p>With those goals in mind, we decided to run a brainstorm with the team, categorizing ideas into “Do now,” “Worth considering,” and “Wild &amp; crazy.” We invited the working group: PM <a href="https://twitter.com/benstern0?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Ben Stern</a>, engineering manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/twright0/">Thomas Wright</a>, designer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanhsu/">Jordan Hsu</a>, engineers <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshtabak/">Josh Tabak</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stanhuan">Stanley Huang</a>, in addition to many other cross-functional partners from the research, data, support, marketing, and sales teams.</p><p>Marketing offered design ideas, product shared feedback on research, and engineers wrote suggestions for UX. We couldn’t have generated such a diverse list of ideas without everyone on board, and even though everyone came from a different perspective, we were excited to see common themes emerge. To synthesize input, we grouped related ideas into those main themes. Then, Ben mapped suggestions to the user feedback that we received, and derived a shortlist of priorities. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670&amp;h=387&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f686b08f80b5b732feae570b354ac94abf73e3c-1600x924.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The enterprise team’s initial brainstorm session in Figma</figcaption></figure><p>After the brainstorm, we wondered how to scope this project. Should it be a simple UI update or a larger overhaul? Initially, we thought we might be able to layer different views and options onto our existing Admin Settings. But when we partnered with the sales team to better understand points of friction, we heard that admins didn’t have enough information to make good decisions at true-up, weren’t aware of the features most relevant to them, and were exporting information manually. </p><p>The design of the Admin Settings view was limiting the value any individual feature could provide; redesigning it to optimize for certain key workflows would allow us to not only add new features easily, but also make better use of the features we had previously built. Instead of just addressing the symptom, Ben advocated for turning this workstream into a full product update. </p><h2 id="building-for-scale"><a href="#building-for-scale">Building for scale</a></h2><p>Unlike enterprise companies that are enterprise-only (and often only build for companies with a certain number of employees or functions), Figma supports organizations of all sizes. Beyond providing a better user experience for admins and end users alike, developing a tool that scales well is central to what we do. To us, that means creating a strong foundation that also gives us the flexibility to add and update features as user needs evolve.</p><p>While all product development requires a deep understanding of buyers, stakeholders, and end users, enterprise work demands insights into not just individuals and their challenges, but also broader organizational dynamics. Figma needs to flex to fit teams of 5 or 5,000—one person might play many roles that span admin responsibilities, design ops, and individual design work at smaller organizations, whereas enterprise companies often dedicate entire teams to each function. </p><p>For example, a VP-level budget-holder needs to understand the value of the product across their organization; someone from design ops needs to ensure teams have the necessary permissions and access to resources; security teams need peace of mind that their organization&#39;s data is secure. On top of that, each individual user has unique requirements, motivations, and challenges for using the product every day.</p><p>To end users, an organization’s admin tooling is likely an afterthought. But for admins, settings are central to their day-to-day work; it’s where they get crucial visibility over account usage, access security controls, and manage team members. We realized that some of the confusion came from non-admins accessing information that they didn’t need. Similarly, admins were seeing prompts to create files and view designs in teams and projects, which were more tailored to non-admin workflows. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?rect=2,0,2876,1640&amp;w=670&amp;h=382&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7ae2fa10951129b02c88f9075290fdefa88d3005-2880x1640.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Before the redesign: anyone in the organization could access a list of all the members</figcaption></figure><p>So, we decided to remove admin-only pages for non-admins and build a new top-level navigation option that separates the Admin Settings view from the broader Organization page—which any Organization member can see—and paths to design creation and consumption (like drafts and teams).

Aside from more clear and robust filters and sorting mechanisms to help admins manage members, admins frequently request an intuitive shift+click behavior to quickly select many members at once. This behavior would allow them to more easily perform bulk actions like copying emails for a subset of members, or modifying many users’ permissions at once. We knew we wanted to incorporate this into the Admin Settings refresh. </p><p>Once we decided what to build, Jordan got to work on a design spec and shared his early thinking with the team. At many companies, a design spec will tell you exactly what to implement, and a high fidelity prototype oftentimes matches the exact user experience we want to achieve. While Jordan’s designs were nothing short of incredible, they left room for discussion rather than specifying implementation decisions to a tee. On the enterprise product team—and this is true of work across Figma—we like to invite early feedback. Instead of work feeling like a handoff from one person to the next, we approach it more as an open discussion. </p><p>Jordan’s designs specified polished click-targets and selection and hover states, but functionalities like how users actually select many rows, add to their selections, and deselect were left undefined. While Josh and Stanley were ultimately responsible for development on this project, they took the initiative to conduct informal research to see how other tools support bulk selection. In looking at Asana, Gmail, and other tools, they found that multi-selection and deselection using shift+click could be implemented in a variety of ways. They aggregated their research and came up with a proposal for what they wanted to implement, optimizing not only for feasibility and reusability, but also for an intuitive, enjoyable user experience. They received great feedback from our team (and more importantly, our users!), and we shipped it.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?rect=1,0,4049,2484&amp;w=670&amp;h=411&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/83445ca1d8657e94447b41f6d663e1d5c5abf4b3-4052x2484.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Feedback on an early prototype of how multi-selection would work in the redesigned Admin Settings</figcaption></figure><p>This is just one example of how people at Figma are given the opportunity and encouraged to take on different roles and help make product decisions beyond their formal job description.

Admins, I hope you find our added features and functionality easy to use and enjoyable! Looking back to my first few days at Figma, I wasn’t sure how I’d feel working on an enterprise team. I thought my work might be laid out for me by customer requests, leaving little room for creativity and ownership. However, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by the amount of ownership, collaboration, and decision-making involved in enterprise work at Figma. The Admin Settings refresh project was just one of many opportunities to work closely with and build for our users, and I’m so excited to come to work every day to learn about new user needs and brainstorm sustainable solutions. </p><p>As we continue onboarding more organizations (with varying sizes, structures, and use cases) to Figma, our team needs more hands on deck. In addition to growing our current team in San Francisco (<a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-work-is-changing-at-figma/">and now, remote</a>!), we’re hiring for a new in-person, enterprise workstream in New York, that will open when it becomes safe to do so.

      <title>React at 60fps: improving scrolling comments in Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/improving-scrolling-comments-in-figma/</link>
      <description>A behind-the-scenes look at how we improved comment performance in the Figma editor</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Over the past few weeks, you may have noticed that comment pins started scrolling more smoothly as you pan around the canvas. We’ve recently improved frame rate per second performance three-fold. <a href="https://twitter.com/kiko_lamb">Kiko Lam</a>, an engineer on Figma’s collaboration team, shares how she approached this project—investigating the underlying cause of slow performance, challenges with comment implementation, and our results and next steps.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="tpLlxBPFmlSq" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Figma enables closer collaboration between designers and non-designers by tightening the feedback loop. By commenting directly on a file or prototype, teammates have important context, without needing to send files back and forth. </p><p>Since <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-meet-the-internet/">we first introduced Figma</a>, we’ve been making consistent improvements to reach new levels of scale. As more users leave an increasing number of comments on their files, we started to observe performance problems. Knowing that Figma supports teams and organizations of all sizes, we had to do better. So, we kicked off a project to improve the speed at which comments respond when users zoom and pan on the canvas.</p><h2 id="react-faster-per-second"><a href="#react-faster-per-second">React faster, per second</a></h2><p>Our primary goal was to render the editor at 60fps. No matter how our users collaborated, or how many comments and threads they created, we wanted to the editor to perform at a speed that could flex to support them.</p><figure><figcaption>60fps is much smoother than 15 or 30fps</figcaption></figure><h3 id="but-first-infrastructure"><a href="#but-first-infrastructure">But first, infrastructure</a></h3><p>Before we dive into performance, it’s important to understand a bit about Figma’s technology. Figma is built on an unconventional stack—like our <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/">CTO Evan shared</a>, we essentially made “a browser inside a browser.” Our design editor is powered by <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/">WebGL</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/">WebAssembly</a>, with some of the user interface implemented in Typescript and React. Unlike most static interfaces built in React, comments are dynamic, and they can pan and zoom as part of the canvas. As you scroll around the canvas, we anchor your comment to something we call a comment pin, which ensures that your feedback stays exactly where you want it.</p><p>To do so, we need to get constant viewport updates from our editor. The viewport updates are stored in Redux and retrieved by the comment components. Each comment pin component uses this information to calculate where the comment pins should be rendered on the canvas in relation to the viewport.</p><h2 id="getting-to-the-bottom-of-slow-performance"><a href="#getting-to-the-bottom-of-slow-performance">Getting to the bottom of slow performance</a></h2><p>In order to improve performance on this particular view, we needed to identify what was slowing it down. We used two main tools: Chrome performance tools and React Profiler.</p><h3 id="components-constantly-re-render"><a href="#components-constantly-re-render">Components constantly re-render</a></h3><p>The profile generated from the Chrome performance tools shows that most of the time was spent on JavaScript (JS). About 68ms per frame is spent on JS on a page with 30 comments and only a small port of the computing time per frame is spent on rendering and painting. Scripting refers to JS events and event handlers; rendering and painting have to do with the translation of HTML elements to displayable on-screen elements. It’s promising that most improvement could be done on the JS and React optimization, but we still needed to understand more of what’s happening under the hood of rendering the comment components in React.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?rect=0,0,2944,2056&amp;w=670&amp;h=468&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a45814771f7ed1d327481b7c67b576ce656cd36-2944x2058.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Chrome performance tool shows we spent the majority of time on scripting and rendered the comments view at 19fps with 30 comment threads</figcaption></figure><p>We used React Profiler to pinpoint which components were actually re-rendering. React profile shows that only about 1.8ms is spent rendering the comments view. This re-rendering is necessary because its content is changing. However, from the React Profile, we observed that a lot of time was consumed rendering many fixed position components like the left panel, toolbar view, and properties panel. But intuitively, only the comment should care about the viewport change, not these fixed components. The biggest inefficiency that creeps in as React applications grow is needlessly re-rendering components, which is exactly what we observed. This was a red flag, and we needed to address it.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50a6ccd52685cb9fee5f82ce55488721094a75d5-2944x1250.png?rect=0,1,2944,1248&amp;w=670&amp;h=284&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50a6ccd52685cb9fee5f82ce55488721094a75d5-2944x1250.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50a6ccd52685cb9fee5f82ce55488721094a75d5-2944x1250.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50a6ccd52685cb9fee5f82ce55488721094a75d5-2944x1250.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50a6ccd52685cb9fee5f82ce55488721094a75d5-2944x1250.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50a6ccd52685cb9fee5f82ce55488721094a75d5-2944x1250.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>React Profiler shows the left panel, toolbar view, properties panel, comments list, and comments view re-rendered with every viewport change</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba834555ce8a8e43a613c90c19af6f7539e3d2f4-2944x1472.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba834555ce8a8e43a613c90c19af6f7539e3d2f4-2944x1472.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba834555ce8a8e43a613c90c19af6f7539e3d2f4-2944x1472.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba834555ce8a8e43a613c90c19af6f7539e3d2f4-2944x1472.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba834555ce8a8e43a613c90c19af6f7539e3d2f4-2944x1472.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba834555ce8a8e43a613c90c19af6f7539e3d2f4-2944x1472.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>How different components are structured in the Figma editor</figcaption></figure><p>We started investigating why the other components were re-rendering when viewport information in the Redux store changed. We found that Redux runs every single middleware and loops through and runs mapsStateToProps for every connected component, each time an action is dispatched. It then passes all of the data down through multiple layers to the comments view. But in our case, the only thing that should need this is the comments view. We had instances where we were passing in anonymous functions to force the components to render over and over again. </p><h2 id="our-approach"><a href="#our-approach">Our approach</a></h2><p>To fix the unnecessary re-rendering, we decided to remove viewport information from our Redux store and instead implemented our own <a href="https://css-tricks.com/understanding-event-emitters/">event emitter</a> in our React codebase to broadcast this piece of information. We switched over from old components to functional components and, using React Hooks—which enabled us to memorize expensive computation—we now only do them when information changes. By avoiding dispatching an action to update viewport information in Redux, we successfully stopped running mapStateToProps for every connected component and avoided passing all of the data down through multiple layers to the comments view. As a result, we essentially prevented other components that don’t need ViewportInfo from re-rendering.</p><h3 id="better-but-not-quite-there"><a href="#better-but-not-quite-there">Better, but not quite there</a></h3><p>At this point, we ran the Chrome performance tool and React Profiler again. We saw that the constant re-rendering had stopped and the frame rate of comment view had significantly improved from 15fps to 50fps with 50 comment pins. However, we still weren’t quite at our goal of 60fps. We also observed that performance linearly degrades with the increasing number of comment pins. So, we still had work ahead of us. </p><h3 id="o-n-operation-on-every-viewport-change"><a href="#o-n-operation-on-every-viewport-change">O(n) operation on every viewport change</a></h3><p>TJ Pavlu, an engineer on my team, worked with me on further improvements. By observing how the comment pins move on the document level, we noticed that every comment pin performs a transform action when viewport moves. Each of the comment pin components was recomputing its pin position and performing a transform-style action with each viewport change (which you’ll see in the screen recording below). In turn, comments view triggers an 0(n) operation, where n is the number of comment threads as we pan and zoom. This might seem trivial for files with just a few comments, but the more comments there are, the slower the operation.</p><figure><figcaption>With every viewport change, each of the comment pin components recomputed its pin position and performed a transform-style action</figcaption></figure><p>We came up with the solution to create an overlay container on the canvas and then to position the comment pins statically on this container. From there, we repositioned the overlay container (one computation) using CSS translate instead of doing so with each comment pin (n computations) as the viewport moves (illustrated in the second screen recording). Now, every viewport change triggers an O(1) operation instead of O(n) operation.</p><figure><figcaption>Only the overlay parent component recomposes its position on viewport changes</figcaption></figure><p>We created this overlay container by creating a box around the most top-left pin and the most bottom-right pin. This means every time a new comment is added, we have to recompute this top-left/bottom-right boundary box.

      <title>How we use Figma templates to facilitate collaboration at Shopify</title>

      <description>A framework for project managing in Figma</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>“Which of these designs are the latest ones? Has this layout been approved and is it ready to be implemented? Which prototype are you planning to test with your users?” Some of these questions might sound familiar to you.</em></p><p><em>Tools like Figma make collaboration effortless. However, this also introduces complexity in communicating states or processes and navigating files and artifacts that are being created over time.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="ppF_Qww6MJBa" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>I’m a Staff Product Designer on Shopify’s Retail Foundations team. Our team works on global features within Retail but we also provide tools like the <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/experiences/selling-in-person">Polaris for Retail design system</a>, guidelines, templates, and documentation so that other teams can do their best work.</p><p>Over the last few months we were part of many conversations where team members shared feedback on how we organize our files in Figma. It turned out that with people using different approaches for this, it became increasingly difficult for other disciplines like product or engineering and even for colleagues working in UX to find specific information within a file.</p><p>The format laid out <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/872568832985837673">in this template</a> creates a predictable structure that other disciplines can expect when navigating between files while also helping teams and individuals in getting set up faster at the beginning of a project.</p><h2 id="how-to-use-this-template"><a href="#how-to-use-this-template">How to use this template</a></h2><p>Get Sh*t Done (GSD) is a light-weight, common-sense framework to manage projects across Shopify. By design, GSD offers a minimum process for maximum value. GSD has 3 phases: <strong>Think, Explore, Build</strong>.</p><p>The page structure of this template follows the reverse order of the GSD process. In order to offer the most important information first we show what’s ready for build at the top of all pages. You’ll want to have people spend most of their time in the first few pages of your file.</p><p>As you create a new file and after creating a cover and a project overview, make sure to start filling the pages in the Think section with content first.</p><p>Once you move into the Explore phase create as many new pages for new explorations and prototypes as you want. This is your playground and place to go both broad and deep!</p><p>As soon as you’re ready for Build simply take some of the pages or layout that made the cut and move them from your Explore section into the Build phase.</p><p>Let’s dig into some more details for each of these sections.</p><h2 id="it-all-starts-with-a-cover"><a href="#it-all-starts-with-a-cover">It all starts with a cover</a></h2><p>Start a new file by customizing the cover. This allows you to share high level information like the project name, the team that’s owning the project and the status of the project. Having a cover also makes it easier to find the file you’re looking for in the grid view of a Figma project.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb5c5e5befba15cc5f336caf677468197a53084c-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb5c5e5befba15cc5f336caf677468197a53084c-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb5c5e5befba15cc5f336caf677468197a53084c-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb5c5e5befba15cc5f336caf677468197a53084c-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb5c5e5befba15cc5f336caf677468197a53084c-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eb5c5e5befba15cc5f336caf677468197a53084c-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Pro tip: As the project progresses make sure to update the status indicator.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="project-overview"><a href="#project-overview">Project overview</a></h2><p>The overview page is another opportunity to provide more context.

      <title>An open letter about my gap year</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/an-open-letter-about-my-gap-year/</link>
      <description>Student Fellow Abigail Africa shares advice from mentors and reflects on the value of education</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Abigail Africa is part of Figma’s inaugural Student Fellowship, a program that seeks to amplify student perspectives at Figma and bring Figma to more classrooms. Knowing how much has changed over these past few months, Abigail—like so many students—has been grappling with what going “back to school” this fall really means, deciding whether or not to complete her degree at USC.</em> </p><p><em>So, she turned to Figma co-founder and CEO Dylan Field, who opened up the conversation to other thoughtful leaders. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG">watch their conversations</a> and read on for some of the highlights.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="nyv0DA2nHN5o" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>To college students everywhere –</p><p>It’s early August, and I’m back in my college town. The typical signs of fall are beginning to appear, with small twists: the USC Target has dusted off their <em>Welcome back, students!</em> banner, and shipments of cheap microwaves and white plastic storage bins have taken over most of the store. People mill around them cautiously. Professors have again begun emailing students about the coming semester, but in place of the usual decisive messages about materials and policies have come gentle reminders that everyone should maintain a flexible mindset.</p><p>It seems like everyone is trying to stay open-minded, but it’s still hard for me to muster this much flexibility. I’ve spent the past three years constructing a vision of my final year in my major program, where my senior capstone involves pitching, running, and growing a startup. Beyond that, I still have several GE’s to finish and leadership positions to fill on campus. My instinct is to clench my fists and find every opportunity to preserve that vision. I know that many people reading this letter can’t quite square with the idea of a remote year yet, either—especially if that means going without the nights spent huddled around one computer, experimenting side-by-side in our makerspace, or trying on new skills making hardware, recording podcasts, or shooting videos, just to see if we enjoy it.</p><p>Naturally, there has been a lot of conversation about our plans for the fall. From what I can tell, at least a third of my program is taking classes from their high school bedrooms. Students without a scholarship are frustrated with the expectation to pay for a degree delivered over Zoom. Some of us are taking classes from the USC area (we’re paying rent, anyway). My international friends have little choice about whether to return, not willing to jeopardize their visas. And I and a few others have been whispering about a gap year.</p><h3 id="whispers-of-a-gap-year"><a href="#whispers-of-a-gap-year">Whispers of a gap year</a></h3><p>When I brought up my gap year a few weeks ago at home, my whole family recoiled. My parents kept recycling similar lines of critical questioning, which always ended at, “Why not just finish?” I sat on the couch, grasping at arguments to make. “You can go back to your job next year,” my dad said. “What makes you think you’ll want to go back to school next fall? You could be taking online classes then, too. A gap year just makes it easier for you to not finish.” </p><p>I went to get a drink from the kitchen. My grandmother, who was cutting fruit, grabbed my face with two hands and whispered, “Just finish. You are almost done.” </p><p>I didn’t have great answers to their questions, at least none that I explained well that day. The simple, unfiltered, rationale for delaying my senior year is three-prong. First, I&#39;d rather be at school when I can invest my time richly—in community, in my classes, in my extracurriculars. Second, if I have access to a fulfilling job in a pandemic, it makes sense to work for a year to build up my savings, so I don’t have to work part-time or search for a job during such an uncertain period. Third, I could benefit from extended experience at a startup if I wanted to run my own some day. But this wasn&#39;t enough. <strong>I couldn’t quite address their other pressing concern—that taking time off meant raising my chances of never returning and never getting my degree. In retrospect, this was probably their most fundamental fear. </strong></p><p>To me and to many of my friends, gap years and dropouts are aspirational—that someone may be so bold, so unique, so extraordinary that they’re all but excused from finishing their degrees. Instead of coursework, we think, we, too, could start building the next unicorn. To my family, however, no one is excused from education. In their minds, education is not only the ladder, but the sole path to success, and it is to be climbed rung by rung, with unwavering discipline and focus. </p><p>All four of my grandparents immigrated in the 70&#39;s, leaving behind careers as a lawyer, shipping merchant, banker, and nurse. They each took up multiple minimum-wage jobs, supporting my parents until they could get degrees at American universities. In turn, my parents took great care to invest everything they could into my education. They were conservative spenders. We didn’t take grand vacations. Instead, they paid for my education. I understood this and worked hard at school; it was clear that learning was always the priority. Eventually, I got into USC with a full merit scholarship. My mom still sends me links to graduate programs, a path I lost interest in a few years ago. Time off does not compute.</p><p>The conversations I’ve been having with friends about whether or not to return to school have been practical, social, and economic: what’s the real cost of going back this fall? Of taking time off? What will I do without my community? How do you think employers will see a gap year? What is the value of a degree, anyway? While there are hard truths about the price of education, the answers to these questions are different for everyone. The biggest one I’ve been grappling with is cultural: do any of these answers change for me as a woman of color?</p><h3 id="my-place-in-silicon-valley"><a href="#my-place-in-silicon-valley">My place in Silicon Valley?</a></h3><p>There has long been a kind of “dropout mythology” in tech—that Silicon Valley glorifies the (usually) Ivy League and (all-too-often) male founder. While it’s a story I’ve grown used to, it’s not one I’ve seen myself reflected in. </p><p>I’m interning this summer at a startup that I care about deeply, and that is taking good care of me. It makes me optimistic that the archetype of the Silicon Valley dropout is gradually opening up, making way for more people like me. It suddenly seems possible that if I never went back to school at all, I could continue to get jobs that I’m meant for, with employers who value me for my merit, and where I’ll excel as long as I work hard. I hold onto this view with a loose grip, hoping this will eventually be the whole truth. But I’ve seen that time and time again, in talking to friends and looking up to heroes, meritocracy is often tangled up in so many concepts—representation, privilege, opportunity—that can weigh heavy on women who look like me.</p><div><blockquote><p>&#34;Predicting who will succeed is an imperfect art. And parts of it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. When venture capitalists say—and they do say—“We think it’s young white men, ideally Ivy League dropouts, who are the safest bets,” and then only invest in young white men with Ivy League backgrounds, of course young white men with Ivy League backgrounds are the only ones who make money for them (they also are the only ones who lose money for them, but who’s keeping track of that?).&#34;</p><p>-Ellen Pao, from her book, <em>Reset</em>, on her time at Kleiner Perkins</p></blockquote></div><p>I’m a Filipino woman. Leaving school is a risk. Not having a degree could be an obstacle. I love school; part of the reason I&#39;m taking time off to work is to preserve my chances of getting to do school in person eventually. But even entertaining the gap year this way is a privilege. I know that most people can&#39;t just flip the switch on enrollment, so I’m humbled to be in the position where it’s a realistic (read: financially feasible) option. Without my scholarship and my job, I wouldn&#39;t be asking these questions at all. But what about my first generation and Black and Latinx peers? Do they get the luxury of deciding that they don’t need the university label to be considered for jobs if they don’t like the way their senior year is looking? </p><h3 id="seeking-wisdom"><a href="#seeking-wisdom">Seeking wisdom</a></h3><p>I took my uncertainty about plans for fall to my mentors. My current boss at Primer, Ryan Delk, gave me a new set of questions to ask, the most straightforward being, “Where are you going to grow more in a year?” This question has echoed around my mind frequently over the last few weeks. I feel strongly that for me, the answer isn&#39;t in <em>remote classes</em>. But what if I&#39;m wrong? </p><p>I called on my previous boss, Camille Ricketts, Notion’s resident wordsmith and general marketing mastermind. “How do you think about regret? What about risk? Self-confidence?” I asked.</p><p>“I wish I had taken far bigger risks earlier in my career,” she told me. “The stakes only get higher as the years go by, and suddenly you find yourself unable to make a radical move or explore something very different. You have too many responsibilities, or your experience has become too specific and focused. Early on is the time to be an energetic and ambitious generalist and get a lot of exposure to many things. Before age 30 is the time to try things that seem scary, or maybe even illogical. Do the things that you love, that inspire you, that you can’t get out of your head, that you find yourself working on or thinking about even when you’re tired or outside of your main work. Looking back now, I had so much optionality and I closed doors for arbitrary reasons. Try a lot of things.”</p><p>And in the long run?</p><p>“Don’t worry about your long-term earning potential. If you’re good at something you love, the money will truly follow. I’ve seen it happen for so many of my peers. It sounds cliche, but I think it’s very important to keep in mind.” </p><h3 id="more-voices"><a href="#more-voices">More voices</a></h3><p>From the 10,000 ft view, this becomes more than a conversation about COVID-specific gap years and moves squarely into considerations about the value of education more broadly. Dylan, who left college to start Figma, offered to bring in other perspectives alongside his own. We invited a small handful of people we knew would be thoughtful on the topic to chat with Dylan over Zoom: <a href="https://youtu.be/SyX6RZJVl3w">Laura Deming</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/5JXdv9IMB9Q">John Maeda</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s1xyZM-2Gw&amp;list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG&amp;index=6&amp;t=31s">Marc Andreessen</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_s1xyZM-2Gw&amp;list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG&amp;index=5&amp;t=0s">Jeff Weiner</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/IKrgpvWrQAU">Karlie Kloss</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/MWVUEJSh7bo">May-Li Khoe</a>. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG">watch all of the interviews here</a>. </p><p>My mind twirled as I started producing the videos with the Figma team. I let their words sink in.</p><p>I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/SyX6RZJVl3w">Laura’s interview</a> first. As she talked to Dylan, it was clear that she knew what she wanted out of her education from the start. Each time she changed paths—from Cynthia Kenyon&#39;s lab, to MIT, to the Thiel Fellowship—she was making a decision to learn in a new, rich way. As I played her interview in my room at USC, I felt that it was valid to pursue the exact education I want right now, even if it comes in the form of working at a startup. May-Li’s words echoed more of the same: “Everything that I have worked on has been another part of my education.” </p><p>At the end of the day, everyone we interviewed agreed that companies shouldn&#39;t require college degrees. Degrees are not a factor in <a href="https://youtu.be/_s1xyZM-2Gw?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG&amp;t=2914">Marc&#39;s decisions about who to fund</a>. Jeff talked through how, and why, companies (including LinkedIn) have <a href="https://youtu.be/kzqPXaPMgCs?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG&amp;t=1799">evolved their thinking on this</a>. For Laura, Ivy League degrees are <a href="https://youtu.be/SyX6RZJVl3w?t=1067">an anti-signal</a>. It&#39;s safe to say that the value of the degree is changing, but maybe not quickly enough for me to abandon mine outright.</p><p>In his interview, Jeff echoed a lot of what Camille had to say—<a href="https://youtu.be/kzqPXaPMgCs?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG&amp;t=1401">find the sweet spot</a> between what you&#39;re good at and what you love. I&#39;m good at what I do for work, and I love being at school. Maybe it&#39;s not such a wild idea to take a year off to work so I can save that fourth year of learning for a better time. This might not be exactly what Jeff meant, but it feels right.</p><p>I take comfort in the fact that John dealt with <a href="https://youtu.be/5JXdv9IMB9Q?t=659">similarly conflicting advice</a> from his idol, Paul Rand, who told him to use money from work to fund passions. And that, <a href="https://youtu.be/_s1xyZM-2Gw?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx7aEo_UucA4v8VSyv7OKViG&amp;t=433">according to Marc</a>, I picked my educational path right; a practical degree from a top school that unlocked me a world of (well-paid) professional opportunities. </p><p>I&#39;m afraid of sounding like someone who peaked in college, but I&#39;m not ready to tie off the things I&#39;ve been building with my friends at USC, namely USC&#39;s undergraduate entrepreneurial community and a physical space that reflects the diversity of that community. </p><p>I listened to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKrgpvWrQAU&amp;feature=youtu.be">Karlie&#39;s interview</a> last. She spoke about the voice in her head reminding her that even when she had everything going in her career, without having had the college experience, she felt like something was missing. The inverse seems true for me, and I think that&#39;s okay. “Listen to yourself,” she said. “You have the answer.”</p><p>I wanted to take time off. Go back when I could really go back.</p><h3 id="one-last-question"><a href="#one-last-question">One last question</a></h3><p>Unfortunately, this still left the most crucial question: What do I say to my parents? </p><p>But, honestly, I didn’t feel like trying to answer it. The ideas I hold about personal growth or education, even when bolstered by these thoughtful and successful people, don’t factor into the investment my family has already made in my education.</p><p>I was resolved to go back to school to avoid another stressful debate, but then I played back the raw recording of John’s interview, and I had to put down my Trader Joe&#39;s Apple Blossoms and replay something he said halfway through. “<a href="https://youtu.be/5JXdv9IMB9Q?t=1760">Calculate the ROI</a>.”  </p><p>And while it’s nearly impossible to quantify the ways their lives had to change to make mine possible, there was some math I knew I could do. So, I did what Jeff (and Marc, and John) recommended—I literally wrote out the numbers: the amount I’d make in my year off, what that could cover, incorporating my student loans, a car, rent for next year, and savings. I sent it to my mom and waited. </p><p>There’s a long silence. And then:</p><div><blockquote><p><strong>Mom:</strong> If you defer…Please promise me you will <em>finish</em>. YOU MUST GET YOUR DEGREE.</p><p><strong>Me:</strong> I promise you I will graduate.</p><p><strong>Mom:</strong> Such a shame…you need it as a minority woman…of diminutive stature. </p></blockquote></div><p>She has a point. I am pretty short. </p><h3 id="my-plans-for-next-year"><a href="#my-plans-for-next-year">My plans for next year</a></h3><p>Today, I’m officially withdrawing from all of my courses for the year of 2020-2021. I’m planning on spending the year working. I know my reflections are personal, but this letter is meant for anyone who’s also asking themselves similar questions. Each question is highly individual, and not everyone has a job, or an idea, or a safety net for a gap year. Wherever you are, you’re not alone in this conundrum. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="MecrzZ-kljss" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>If you want to join the conversation about taking time off, exploring different options, or making the most out of this year, check out Figma’s student Slack group, <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/figmavirtualcampus/shared_invite/zt-el50hsaf-3mpeZsFwUudowDoxL1FkJA">Virtual Campus</a>.

      <title>How work is changing at Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-work-is-changing-at-figma/</link>
      <description>Sharing our approach to a new way of working</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re seven months into 2020, and I think we’re all still grieving the lives we had before COVID-19 hit the world. Grief is not linear and we all move through it in different ways. Some of us have processed the situation we are in and are ready for what’s next. Others are adapting to this new world. And some of us are still in denial, comforted by the hope that our pre-COVID lives could return at any moment. </p><p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHXmj3hN5mI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=184">time passes by</a>, it’s clear work and life are changing in significant ways. COVID-19 has weakened the network effects of cities across the world. More and more people are winding down their overpriced leases and moving elsewhere to save money or be near loved ones. </p><p>These trends, along with Figmate feedback, motivated us to make some big changes. Once offices are safe to open again, we’re moving towards a hybrid model, where we offer both in-person and remote work options. This is a departure from the mostly in-person approach we had before COVID. </p><p>We took an employee-centric approach to this decision, using an internal survey to inform our plan. Many companies are grappling with similar choices, so in the hopes of helping others think through it, we’re sharing our approach and results.</p><h2 id="hard-calls-in-uncertain-times"><a href="#hard-calls-in-uncertain-times">Hard calls in uncertain times</a></h2><p>Given recent trends, we had a feeling Figma’s original remote policy wasn’t going to work for a post-COVID world, but our leadership team was divided on how it should evolve. Even discussing these issues was difficult given we hadn’t aligned on the same language. It was hard not to conflate plans for reopening the office with our future workplace strategy. And since reopening the office is a huge can of worms in itself, we decided to separate these decisions and work backwards from our long term policy.</p><p>In times of uncertainty, values are good tools for decision making, and we leaned heavily on them for this process. During one of our first conversations, we debated if we needed to decide now versus later. Why not pause to see what our peers would do, then follow their lead? Ultimately we decided that we shouldn’t wait to work through this—lack of clarity was a source of employee anxiety and we needed to pick a direction so we could start optimizing our culture. Furthermore, one of our company values is “Be Bold” which refers to our history of working on meaningful projects, even when they are hard. It’s decidedly not bold to just wait and see what everyone else does!</p><p>We quickly realized we needed to understand Figmate preferences in order to create a policy that would work for our team. After failing to find a survey template that fit our specific needs, I partnered with Figma’s Head of People to create a new one. The survey was then vetted with our amazing research team who gave great feedback. </p><p>To get as complete a picture as possible of our staff’s preferences, we gathered personal stories and hard numbers, via both write-in and multiple choice questions. We asked about everything from commute habits to productivity levels during COVID to remote work preferences.</p><p>Interested in adapting the survey we created for Figma? You can see <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Figmas-Return-to-WorkWorkforce-Planning-Survey--A5dwt28aR4tK2gwU9iXRXFB5Ag-nKGryo4w3h6Z0WraMxgd4">the questions here</a>. We encourage you to use this as a way to hear people as individuals. Dig into your employees’ understanding of the survey’s language. Push for a majority response rate. Gather different kinds of information. Do the work. It’s hard and time-consuming…but worth it!</p><h2 id="survey-results"><a href="#survey-results">Survey results</a></h2><p>The survey was lengthy and only open for one week, but more than 90% of our team filled it out (with no reminders).  It was immediately clear that this is a topic everyone at Figma feels strongly about.</p><p>After the submission deadline closed, I spent the weekend parsing through data. It was a learning experience for me to understand where various employees were coming from in their answers and I was surprised with many of the results. I’d expected at least some level of convergence on certain topics, but almost no one had the same opinion on these issues. It was clear that I’d need to make an informed decision on the workplace policy and then own it as CEO. </p><p>For example, in one multiple choice question we asked people how they defined “flexible schedule,” in terms of which days in a given week should be available for WFH. (This was a follow up to whether they preferred a flexible work schedule, working entirely from the office or entirely from home.) Seemingly everyone had a different take on what flexible meant for them.</p><p>Digging into location preferences, almost half of employees currently based in San Francisco said they would consider moving to another city within commute distance if we offered multiple WFH days per week. Nearly two thirds of employees said they would consider moving to a non-hub location before the end of 2022 if all roles had the option to be remote. When asked why they were interested in moving or working remotely, Figmates cited cost of living, desire for home ownership, and wanting to be closer to family.</p><p>At the same time, many employees told us in free text replies how much they loved the office; it was clear people missed the sense of connection and serendipity it enabled. They self-ranked their productivity scores as high, despite everything happening in the world right now. But many said they weren’t making connections to employees outside their core team, and there was a lot of FOMO about not knowing new hires. (The Figma team is <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">rapidly scaling</a>.)</p><h2 id="validation"><a href="#validation">Validation</a></h2><p>The data showed our employees valued flexibility but still had an attachment to our office. So we decided to talk with a number of hybrid companies, which led to some really valuable insights:</p><p><strong>1. Where to find someone:</strong> It’s important for employees to have a predictable mental model for where they can find the people they work with.</p><p><strong>2. Timing for office days:</strong> Implementing a fully flexible WFH schedule can lead to a “ghost town” office. If no one comes in at the same time, then you lose the moments of connection and serendipity that make in-person offices beneficial.</p><p><strong>3. The hybrid model is hard:</strong> All the companies we talked with were committed to the hybrid workplace model, but they all were open about its challenges, especially with remote inclusion.</p><p>Given this feedback and survey results, we landed on the following policy:</p><h3 id="hubs"><a href="#hubs">Hubs</a></h3><ul><li>Everyone has to choose whether they will associate with a hub or be remote.</li><li>The SF hub will have a flexible model, where people will be expected to come in at least two specific days per week. These days will be the same for everyone in the office to maximize connection and serendipity.</li><li>As we open new hubs, there will initially be an expectation of more in-office time as we build momentum around the physical space. Over time, the policy for these new hubs will converge with the rest of the company.</li></ul><h3 id="remote"><a href="#remote">Remote</a></h3><ul><li>We will initially support all continental US for remote work.</li><li>Sufficient working hours overlap is required for Figma to approve remote work.</li><li>Pay will be localized immediately for new hires and in 2021 for current Figmates.</li></ul><p>In many ways, we followed our normal design process in revising this policy. We thought about the competitive landscape and ecosystem, collected data, explored different options and then converged on a solution. However, unlike making a product change, this was weirdly emotional for me—small changes in policy sometimes felt like we were leaping between potential worlds. I didn’t feel like I had a framework for the decision until the end of our process and at times it was as if there was nothing to hold onto.</p><h2 id="communication-and-rollout"><a href="#communication-and-rollout">Communication and rollout</a></h2><p>As I prepped an All Hands presentation called “The future is remote” for the Figma team, I tried to keep in mind that employees were at different stages of processing all the changes brought by COVID. I did my best to be transparent about how we made the decision to move to this new model, and I walked Figmates through the trends, survey results and policy decisions we considered. Finally we talked about Figma’s role in building products for distributed and remote teams.</p><p>We still had certain details to nail down, and we knew we’d be inundated with questions. But we wanted to share as early as possible rather than keep employees in the dark.</p><p>Since the presentation, our team has been working on the necessary processes and policies that underlie the hybrid workforce model. As you might imagine, it adds a bunch of complexity throughout our systems. A few examples: </p><ul><li>Employment laws and rules differ from state to state so contracts with remote employees must be handled differently depending on location.</li><li>For comp localization, we are still collecting data and finalizing our strategy for different locations.</li><li>We are working on setting standard working hours for all US-based employees.</li></ul><h2 id="final-reflections"><a href="#final-reflections">Final reflections</a></h2><p>Looking ahead, we’re thinking a lot about how Figma’s culture needs to change so we can adapt to this hybrid world. Right now our communication is very synchronous and verbal. Over time, I’m eager to move the team towards more async and artifact-based communication in order to reduce the number of meetings (Zoom fatigue is real!) and make decision making more transparent. These are important changes that will allow us to be more inclusive of remote workers once office hubs open up.</p><p>While this decision feels “right” to me, it’s hard to know exactly how this will play out over time; we will need to find ways to measure if it’s working and adjust if it’s not. I’m under no illusion that migrating from an in-office culture to a flexible, hybrid model will be simple and we have a lot to learn. But I’m glad we made this decision now, instead of waiting to see how COVID unfolds. It gives our employees the information they need for important life choices and it allows us to make long-term optimizations to the way we work.</p><p>My hope is that this recap is helpful to others who are working through similar issues. I’m sure some readers will disagree with our methods or conclusions—if this is you, I invite you to join the conversation and share your organization’s plans for the future. As challenging as this period of change has been, I’m truly excited to see what new models and experiments come out of it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jessie explained that the first, “Material Theme” provides a foundation for users who want to create their own themes: “This part can be used to customize typography and color palettes and see how that affects components, states system, and example layouts in a quick glance.” The second is more of a traditional stickersheet.</p><p>“Anyone could treat this design kit as a canvas to explore various ways to customize existing components, to visualize (and possibly learn more about) our design guidelines, and to define their brand or product’s own identity,” she said.</p><h3 id="bonnie-kate-wolf-open-figures"><a href="#bonnie-kate-wolf-open-figures">Bonnie Kate Wolf, Open Figures</a></h3><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0475756983eaa4cbf179306aa124ae7a88da86e7-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0475756983eaa4cbf179306aa124ae7a88da86e7-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0475756983eaa4cbf179306aa124ae7a88da86e7-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0475756983eaa4cbf179306aa124ae7a88da86e7-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0475756983eaa4cbf179306aa124ae7a88da86e7-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0475756983eaa4cbf179306aa124ae7a88da86e7-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/842511952602480972">Link</a></p><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/@wolf">Bonnie Kate Wolf</a>, illustrator at Oura, built <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/842511952602480972">Open Figures</a>, an illustration library. Previously, Bonnie Kate developed modular systems at companies like Square, where they were largely used to help product designers self-serve illustrations. In making this library for Blush, she had more creative freedom: “It gave me a chance to create a new little style that didn’t rely on any company’s guidelines,” <a href="https://medium.com/@bonniekatewolf/why-i-illustrate-for-blush-f45147c21a2d">she wrote</a>. “I got to build exactly what I wanted.” And what she built is a library that can be used for whatever you need. “I hope folks can use it to tell stories through product, in presentations, and just for fun!”</p><p>She also noted that drawing these illustrations was an important reminder to design with accessibility and inclusion in mind: “When designing for the character in the wheelchair (which was part of the original plan), we realized that to make everything swap, we had to cut out dresses and long jackets so that all the tops would work for the wheelchair user.” </p><h3 id="barton-smith-and-cliona-o-sullivan-spotify-ways"><a href="#barton-smith-and-cliona-o-sullivan-spotify-ways">Barton Smith and Cliona O’Sullivan, Spotify Ways of Working</a></h3><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/43620ec44ea89b7bfc000f95f3ef2e9ac70140aa-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/43620ec44ea89b7bfc000f95f3ef2e9ac70140aa-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/43620ec44ea89b7bfc000f95f3ef2e9ac70140aa-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/43620ec44ea89b7bfc000f95f3ef2e9ac70140aa-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/43620ec44ea89b7bfc000f95f3ef2e9ac70140aa-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/43620ec44ea89b7bfc000f95f3ef2e9ac70140aa-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/832911648132248625">Link</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/bartonsmith">Barton Smith</a>, an Associate Principal Product Designer, and Cliona O’Sullivan, Global Head of Design Operations, along with the Figma working group at Spotify, built the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/832911648132248625">Spotify Ways of Working</a> file to share how their team collaborates and organizes their work in Figma. “From talking to other companies, it was clear that there was no tried-and-true model for organizing work in Figma and that, for some, it was a pain point,” Barton said. “So we thought the community might benefit from taking a peek inside our approach.”</p><p>As the team at Spotify has gotten comfortable with this structure in place, they’re already starting to make tweaks based on their learnings: “We’re already revising some of our decisions as we receive more feedback from our design team and will continue to do so, as more ideas emerge.”</p><p>Barton and Cliona hope that the file inspires other teams to revisit their own structure and processes. “After all,” <a href="https://spotify.design/article/how-spotify-organises-work-in-figma-to-improve-collaboration">they wrote</a>, “you can’t collaborate on work you can’t find.”</p><h3 id="victoria-leontieva-remote-design-sprinting"><a href="#victoria-leontieva-remote-design-sprinting">Victoria Leontieva, Remote Design Sprinting</a></h3><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/39731c4e19d3ac56588b119820f27bc45d731c39-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/39731c4e19d3ac56588b119820f27bc45d731c39-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/39731c4e19d3ac56588b119820f27bc45d731c39-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/39731c4e19d3ac56588b119820f27bc45d731c39-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/39731c4e19d3ac56588b119820f27bc45d731c39-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/39731c4e19d3ac56588b119820f27bc45d731c39-1600x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/822141660209426062">Link</a></p><p>During her time at Microsoft, <a href="https://www.figma.com/@killnicole">Victoria Leontieva</a> tested out a remote-friendly design sprint with her team. “When the pandemic hit, the team encouraged me to share the template with the community because of how relevant remote work had become,” she said.

It was late afternoon, and although my voice ached from hours of conversation, the animated on-screen demo caught my eye. As I spoke with an engineer, I found myself grinning with renewed energy, surprised at how effortlessly our conversation drifted from introductions into a spirited discussion of design tools. While the role didn’t work out for me that year, I was thrilled to join Figma’s internship program this summer.</p><h2 id="a-warm-welcome"><a href="#a-warm-welcome">A warm welcome</a></h2><p>As soon as I started, Figmates flooded my Slack with welcome messages, and my teammates scheduled (virtual) coffee chats for us to get to know each other. Even though the company had grown since that career fair, the culture felt just as open and inviting. Later, my team sent a glorious welcome card—a Figma file filled with warm greetings and doodles. While we weren’t face-to-face, I felt the energy that initially drew me to that booth years ago.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5cd3d83b5529026833129d92d303f1ee477994b3-3222x2002.png?rect=0,0,3222,2001&amp;w=670&amp;h=416&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5cd3d83b5529026833129d92d303f1ee477994b3-3222x2002.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5cd3d83b5529026833129d92d303f1ee477994b3-3222x2002.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5cd3d83b5529026833129d92d303f1ee477994b3-3222x2002.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5cd3d83b5529026833129d92d303f1ee477994b3-3222x2002.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5cd3d83b5529026833129d92d303f1ee477994b3-3222x2002.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The welcome note sent to me once I accepted the internship offer</figcaption></figure><h2 id="interning-remotely"><a href="#interning-remotely">Interning, remotely</a></h2><p>Going into the internship, I knew the remote work environment would pose a few challenges. Beyond the potential for miscommunication or missed messages over Slack and email, I worried that I wouldn’t be able to form close relationships with my new team members. Plus, so much of an internship program is about getting as much context as possible—being surrounded by people who help you learn the ins and outs of the role. Would I feel comfortable asking for help over Slack? Would I get lost in the shuffle? In such an unprecedented time, I didn’t know what to expect.</p><h3 id="building-relationships"><a href="#building-relationships">Building relationships</a></h3><p>Without being able to tap someone on the shoulder, have a spontaneous conversation in the hallway, or grab coffee near the office, I imagined it might be more difficult to interact with those beyond my immediate team. To my surprise, this wasn’t the case. While we weren’t in the office, the team was intentional about creating opportunities to meet others across Figma. Each week brought company-wide events like show-and-tell—a biweekly meeting where Figmates share recent learnings or in-progress work. During our Thursday tech talks, I learned about Figmates’ passions, hobbies, and creative projects (like how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHXmj3hN5mI">Figma in Quarantine: the Musical</a> came to life). Through one-on-ones, I gained a deeper insight into Figma’s product and growth, while team activities—like cooking classes, online escape rooms, and scavenger hunts—allowed me to connect with coworkers on a more personal level. </p><h3 id="product-fluency"><a href="#product-fluency">Product fluency</a></h3><p>Before I could dive into a project, I needed to deeply understand Figma’s features and functionality and familiarize myself with design terminology. If I had questions about anything from a new product update to a design concept, I reached out to my mentor, teammates, and Slack channels for support. When I ran into an obstacle, I was surprised by how willing Figmates were to hop on a call and work through the issue together.</p><h2 id="my-first-project-style-picker-improvements"><a href="#my-first-project-style-picker-improvements">My first project: style picker improvements</a></h2><p>I soon learned about my first project: improvements to the style picker, a feature that allows users to browse and apply paint, text, effect, or layout grid styles to objects in the Figma editor. Through meetings with designers and product managers, it soon became clear that these improvements were in high demand from the Figma community. The frustration was understandable—the original style picker became unmanageable as the number of styles increased, obscuring important information and forcing users to manually scroll through long lists. </p><p>At first, I was hesitant. Coming in as an intern, I didn’t expect to have responsibility over a popular, user-facing feature. But as I got started, I realized this would be a great learning experience for me, and a way to build something impactful for our users. Over the next few weeks, I worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/shanawho?lang=en">Shana Hu</a>, the team’s product designer, to implement these improvements:</p><ul><li><strong>Search:</strong> Users often already have a particular style in mind when using the style picker. With search, users can now locate the desired style within a few keystrokes.</li><li><strong>Color styles list view:</strong> The style name—the most identifying attribute for a style—was previously obscured in the grid view layout of the color style picker. The new list view option displays the style name clearly alongside the thumbnail.</li><li><strong>Text style metrics (font size/line height):</strong> Font size and line height are arguably the most defining metrics for text styles. By displaying these metrics directly in the text style picker, users save time when choosing a style.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b294570a8997de5e0e7dfb794b723d1dba6e2090-1608x1654.png?w=670&amp;h=689&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b294570a8997de5e0e7dfb794b723d1dba6e2090-1608x1654.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b294570a8997de5e0e7dfb794b723d1dba6e2090-1608x1654.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b294570a8997de5e0e7dfb794b723d1dba6e2090-1608x1654.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b294570a8997de5e0e7dfb794b723d1dba6e2090-1608x1654.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b294570a8997de5e0e7dfb794b723d1dba6e2090-1608x1654.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Toggle between a list and grid view to quickly browse through styles, or find a specific style with the new search bar</figcaption></figure><p>Since the design systems team is structured vertically, the project involved a continuous exploration of the stack. Through working with Typescript and C++ in the editor and Ruby in the backend, I gained hands-on experience with the full suite of web technologies.</p><p>As the project neared completion, I presented the feature internally during show-and-tell. Figmates filled the Zoom chat with enthusiastic and supportive comments, immediately calming my nerves. Still, the implementation process came with challenges. Before launch, we needed to migrate millions of existing text styles in order to populate their metadata with text style metrics; running the migration alone took an entire day! Other challenges included incorporating feedback from critiques and making last-minute bug fixes. These obstacles were tough in the moment, but they ultimately helped me gain a broader and deeper understanding of the codebase.</p><p>Once the updates were ready to go, I worked with our data science team to make sure we were tracking the right metrics and with marketing to finalize the details of launch day. Everything was coming together, and we were in the final stretch! Launch day soon arrived, and we flipped the feature on, excitedly refreshing the Figma editor as the reactions on social media came in. Reading through the comments, it felt surreal to see the feature that had been guarded for so long finally in the open. As my mentor Josh put it: “It’s the high that keeps you going.”</p><h2 id="my-learnings"><a href="#my-learnings">My learnings</a></h2><p>Based on what I had heard from peers interning elsewhere, I went into this internship thinking that I’d work on a specific part of a feature. Instead, I got to experience what it takes to ship a product, end to end: conception, critiques, implementation, metrics, promotion, and launch. </p><p>While it feels like the internship flew by, when I think back to my first week at Figma, I realize how much I’ve grown as an engineer. True, I’ve learned the rules of React Hooks and the dangers of props spreading, but I’ve also experienced the more nuanced parts of engineering at Figma. Cross-functional interactions improved my ability to communicate technical information, while design critiques, bug bashes, and collaborating with designers sharpened my intuition for product and UX design. Most importantly, assuming engineering responsibility for a feature boosted my confidence, and I feel ready to take on a new challenge.</p><p>In an era of remote work and uncertainty, I didn’t know what to expect at the start of the internship. At best, I hoped to gain a sense of Figma’s product and culture, but instead I found myself enveloped in truly meaningful projects and workflows. I’d like to thank my mentor <a href="https://twitter.com/unfollowjoshshi?lang=en">Josh Shi</a> for his guidance and feedback. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="dUmS1OuEhBXs" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>As our team grows, we&#39;re excited to see more students, educators, and classrooms using Figma.

      <title>Behind the feature: shedding light on shadow spread</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-feature-shadow-spread/</link>
      <description>An engineer&#39;s journey making hard decisions about (seemingly) simple feature requests</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starting today, you can adjust shadow spread in Figma on rectangles, ellipses, frame backgrounds, and component backgrounds, just like you can with CSS <code>box-shadow</code>.</p><p><em>I had initially planned to build this during Figma’s recent <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-making-of-maker-week/">Maker Week</a>, when we set aside time for everyone at the company to explore a project outside of their daily responsibilities. What seemed like a straightforward feature that I could tackle in a few days turned into a weeks-long journey of algorithmic ideas, W3C spec rabbit holes, and nuanced product decisions. Here, I’m sharing more about how we made tough tradeoffs about a (seemingly) simple user request.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="1996le7P9P_G" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>There’s a lot that goes into creating a robust <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/under-the-hood-of-figmas-infrastructure/">web-based design platform</a> for teams who build products together. We provide a system that helps you <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-build-your-design-system-in-figma/">develop</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/measuring-the-value-of-design-systems/">understand the value of</a> complex design systems, enable <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">real-time collaboration</a> for teammates around the world, and even <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-vector-networks/">improve on old standbys</a> like the trusty pen tool. So, you might ask: why, then, in the 958 days since a user <a href="https://spectrum.chat/figma/general/support-for-drop-shadow-spread~46b62ac2-5664-4fe2-9dc4-78a9977ba48e
">first asked on Spectrum</a>, is there no support for shadow spread, a basic feature of CSS’s <code>box-shadow</code>? Is it really so hard for us to, um, make a shadow, just…bigger?</p><p>If you ask a graphics engineer this question, the answer is a resounding <em>well, actually</em>. A shadow’s <code>spread</code> value represents the distance by which to expand or contract a shadow in all directions. To understand when this becomes complicated, we’ll start by considering how we draw shadows in the first place.

I bushwhacked naïvely through the “wrong” approach during Maker Week, realized the problem, and then charged ahead, determined to figure it out. This isn’t rocket science, I thought. <em>We can figure out how to render shadows of 2D shapes.</em></p><p>It’s true that there are a few interesting <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanjkaplan/status/717413392474988544">algorithmic ways</a> to go about this, but none of these slotted neatly into our existing rendering system. It’s also possible to approach this in a non-algorithmic way—by taking advantage of strokes to emulate shadows with spread distances—but I quickly realized that wasn’t an option either; we handle certain vertex angles differently in strokes than you’d want for shadow spread, and we don’t have stroke generation code in our prototype renderer. Somehow we needed to find a way to make this work without adding tons of complex geometry code to two different rendering codebases.</p><h2 id="a-framework-for-prioritization"><a href="#a-framework-for-prioritization">A framework for prioritization</a></h2><p>If there’s one thing I love more than debugging rendering bugs, it’s reading specs about internet technologies. (Ask me <a href="https://medium.com/@lbudorick/weird-things-i-love-about-gifs-e2fed7ccce03">all the weird things I learned about GIF89a</a> when implementing GIF support in Figma last year.) I began to interrogate the assumptions we’d held about shadow spreads. We know Figma users today implement workarounds and include separately maintained documentation for developer handoff when shadow spread values are involved. If we’re building shadow spread because we want to reduce friction during developer handoff, CSS should guide our constraints. Do we really need to draw perfect shadow spreads for hole-y Figma logos? Can we even do that in CSS?!</p><p>In fact, we can&#39;t. The thing about <code>box-shadow</code> is that it only works to render shadows of <em>boxes</em> (and other box-like things, which include ellipses, if you get the corner radii right). <code>box-shadow</code> will not render a shadow of the Figma logo as a copy-of-the-logo-but-blobby; rather, it will render a box.</p><p><em>(An aside: at every step in this process, someone told me, “actually, spread values are supported in <code>filter: drop-shadow()</code>,” and pointed me to an MDN page that mistakenly implied that spread values were included in the spec and were simply not supported by browsers yet. Unfortunately, this was never true, as explicitly noted in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects-1/#funcdef-filter-drop-shadow">W3C spec</a>. We know! We’re sad too.)</em></p><p>Having discussed with our designer advocates, who were sure a huge percentage of use cases would be covered just by having shadow spread available on rectangles and ellipses, and further steeled by the idea that CSS compliance should motivate our decisions here, we determined that it doesn’t matter whether we can render a Figma-shaped logo. We decided to ruthlessly prioritize: we’d at least do what CSS can do.</p><p>To make this happen, we decided to implement CSS-like shadow spread parameters only on shapes where <code>box-shadow</code> would apply: rectangles, ellipses, frame backgrounds, and component backgrounds. This seemed achievable by doing the simple thing, more or less—generating a bigger or smaller version of the original node. It’s not quite as straightforward as stretching the node, as this would break down on things like rounded corners. Still, it’s easy enough to generate new rectangle geometries in both of our rendering engines.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?rect=0,0,1600,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/98ca02d191d31cac616961ea2f22f9565304618e-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Top: a shadow generated simply by stretching the object’s geometry; bottom: a shadow created by generating a new rounded rectangle</figcaption></figure><h2 id="hiccups-along-the-way"><a href="#hiccups-along-the-way">Hiccups along the way</a></h2><p>Of course, nothing was as straightforward as we expected. There were several hitches in this plan: how would we generate correct ellipses? (A true spread shadow for an ellipse would no longer be definitionally elliptical; our ellipse generation code does not generate non-ellipses, and simple transforms on an ellipse in either direction maintain its elliptical properties.) How would we render rounded corners when a spread distance was applied to a rounded rectangle? (The W3 spec defines both a general rule about transforming corner radii, and a specific formula to use for large spread values.) How would we render shadow spread on stroke-only nodes, an undefined behavior in CSS?</p><p>We solved a few of these problems with the tried-and-true science of mashing buttons in a CodePen and seeing what browsers do. Interestingly, browsers don’t implement elliptical shadows with spread by generating spread blobs; they just do the easy thing of generating a larger ellipse. Having decided to mostly do what CSS does, we do that too.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b32ed449c9e7af4113232fa7147444489dd7e5d-1600x901.png?rect=0,0,1600,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b32ed449c9e7af4113232fa7147444489dd7e5d-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b32ed449c9e7af4113232fa7147444489dd7e5d-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b32ed449c9e7af4113232fa7147444489dd7e5d-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b32ed449c9e7af4113232fa7147444489dd7e5d-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b32ed449c9e7af4113232fa7147444489dd7e5d-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The effect becomes more pronounced as an ellipse’s axes diverge:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e1f6d39c7f129cef7728f909c9f166bf7fb69f-1600x901.png?rect=0,0,1600,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e1f6d39c7f129cef7728f909c9f166bf7fb69f-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e1f6d39c7f129cef7728f909c9f166bf7fb69f-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e1f6d39c7f129cef7728f909c9f166bf7fb69f-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e1f6d39c7f129cef7728f909c9f166bf7fb69f-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4e1f6d39c7f129cef7728f909c9f166bf7fb69f-1600x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>More surprisingly, after following the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-backgrounds-3/#shadow-shape">specific W3C cubic rule</a> for corner radii of shadows with large spread values (a <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-backgrounds-3/spread-radius">carefully considered</a> rule!), comparing our results with a quick CodePen indicated that browsers, as of this publication, <a href="https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1900">don&#39;t implement this at all</a>.

      <description>A behind-the-scenes look at how we built deep search</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A few months ago <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/new-ways-to-search-and-provide-context-in-figma/">we launched Universal Search</a> to bring better discoverability and added context to Figma. Building on top of that, we recently rolled out deep search, which allows you to find the right file even faster. Here, we&#39;re giving you a behind-the-scenes look at how we built deep search: the tradeoffs, the technical challenges, and the team who brought it to life.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="LmNDpLmwp7DR" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>When you think back on a project, specific file and folder names probably aren’t top of mind. Instead, you might remember an idea, a snippet of copy, or the problem you solved. Now, with deep search you can find what you’re looking for without knowing the name of the file—type in a keyword, and Figma will return all files that contain that word or phrase.</p><p>Here, we’re giving you an inside look into how deep search came to life—a glimpse into our infrastructure, the technical challenges we faced along the way, and the team who made it happen.</p><h2 id="building-in-the-browser"><a href="#building-in-the-browser">Building in the browser</a></h2><p>We’ve <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/under-the-hood-of-figmas-infrastructure/">previously shared the technical infrastructure</a> required for building a browser-based tool. While it means that our engineering team faces more technical challenges than a standalone desktop application, it also allows us to build features that are unique to a web-based environment.</p><p>These features often translate to better collaboration. Being in the browser allows for streamlined prototyping and handoff, and stakeholders can easily check in on a project without waiting for an exported file. It encourages sharing in-progress work, which ultimately makes the end result better. </p><p>From a product perspective, when we think about which features to build, our roadmap is informed by the benefits that come with being built on the web. Figma has the ability to provide really rich information about all the files you have access to. We can show you how often your components are being used, how frequently your files are viewed, and dig deep into the structure of your file. That’s why deep search felt like the natural next step in bringing added context to your files.</p><h3 id="the-technical-foundation"><a href="#the-technical-foundation">The technical foundation</a></h3><p>Late last year, we launched <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-design-system-analytics/">Design System Analytics</a>, which gives you visibility into how your design systems are used across teams. We were able to leverage much of this infrastructure as the foundation for deep search.</p><p>Both Design System Analytics and deep search required a system that opens a recently edited file, pulls it down from storage and walks through the file to retrieve relevant information. For Design System Analytics, the information was about shared library usage; for deep search, it’s the text within your files. </p><h2 id="bringing-deep-search-to-life"><a href="#bringing-deep-search-to-life">Bringing deep search to life</a></h2><p>While Design System Analytics laid the technical foundation, we still needed to generalize the service. This required unpacking what sets deep search apart.</p><h3 id="what-makes-deep-search-different"><a href="#what-makes-deep-search-different">What makes deep search different</a></h3><p>In all our previous updates to search, including those released by Unified Search, we only had to deal with metadata stored in our database—items like the title of your file and its creator. For our regular search, our data pipeline is similar to search in other tools. We tail relevant tables in our database and stream the IDs of changed items into a messaging system. From there, our search indexers retrieve messages, get the most up to date information from our database and then index that into our elasticsearch cluster. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;h=383&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a897b38c3d32a0dfb55a4aefc577fed534d39823-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A look at our regular search indexing pipeline</figcaption></figure><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>

While our regular search indexers gather a file’s metadata such as its key or team id from the database, the representation of our Fig files (our internal name for Figma files) is stored as a .fig document type in Amazon S3. The Fig file can be thought of as a tree, where a node represents a Figma object like an ellipsis, frame, vector, or some text. Each node also contains an object’s properties.</p><h3 id="making-tradeoffs"><a href="#making-tradeoffs">Making tradeoffs</a></h3><p>While it’s fairly cheap to retrieve things from our database, retrieving a Fig file and then walking through it is extremely computationally expensive because they may have thousands of nodes. It would be expensive to make changes to our deep search index at the same cadence as our regular search index—as you edit your file, a new save is made for you every 30 seconds. Instead, we deduplicate all file changes every hour and send those files off to be processed by our file-analyzer workers—the platform we built for DSA which helps handle computationally intensive, periodic tasks. We made the product decision to allow deep search results to be stale for a short amount of time to save our servers a significant amount of duplicated work.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;h=383&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/18f6cde27a836156a9aa93bbebdf7d71a25c1fe1-3302x1888.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A look at deep search indexing</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s say we have a file that contains five relevant nodes: a frame, rectangle and three text nodes.

</code></pre></div><p><em>The file-analyzer stores the three text nodes in the text_instances field</em></p><p>There was a lot of discussion over what should and shouldn’t be stored in our deep search index. Should instances count, or only components? Do we care about page names and layers or just text? Here, search is more art than science. It’s not immediately clear what would improve search accuracy and what would just be plain noise. To tease out the intricacies, we implemented different versions of deep search to try for ourselves.</p><p>From our hands-on approach, we learned a lot about how users interact with Figma. For example, it turns out that page names—for the most part—are more generic than the contents of your page; page names are relatively short and tend to be categorical rather than unique to the file. A common pattern we found was page names being used to show the progression of the designs: “Idea”, “Rough draft”, “Final.” Searching through page names gives the average user less signal than the content in their page, as they’d apply the same naming scheme for the pages across all their Fig files. </p><p>We also made the call that instances of components matter. There was much debate around this particular discussion—since instances are copies of a main component, leaving them out meant that we could de-duplicate a ton of text, greatly reducing the size of our deep search index. Storage nowadays is relatively cheap, but it’s not free. We ultimately decided that not only do components matter, but also the frequency of components in your Fig file matter too. If you add an instance with the text “Figma is cool” into a file 100 times, this should rank higher in your search results for “Figma is cool” than a file that only has this string once. </p><p>At the end of the day, search is a living, breathing, developing product. We’re learning as we go about what users are looking for and how, and applying this information to make a better product going forward. </p><h3 id="the-team-behind-deep-search"><a href="#the-team-behind-deep-search">The team behind deep search</a></h3><p>While deep search required coordination across teams, the working group was relatively small, allowing us to move quickly. I (Shloak, here!) recently joined Figma full-time, but I worked on deep search while I was an intern on our infrastructure team. I started with an infrastructure-side investigation before partnering closely with Stella, an engineer on our collaboration team, to productize the work. </p><p>Stella oversaw the roll out of our dark and live launches, and brought in our infrastructure and data science partners to ensure the project would be a success. Lizhi, another engineer on infrastructure, was instrumental in making sure file search remained performant. It was incredible to work with such a great team on unique technical problems as an intern, and one of the reasons I chose to return to Figma.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="jYuMhW7e5lg0" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>As we continue thinking about the ways designers collaborate with people across teams, we’ll look to specific workflows, like developer handoff.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 1846, the world welcomed the first public telegraph provider, Electric Telegraph Company. It broke down the barrier of distance and forever changed how people connected with one another. Through the years, Electric Telegraph evolved into what we know of today as <a href="https://www.bt.com/about">BT</a>, one of the world’s leading telecommunications providers who delivers communication services to over 180 countries.</p><p>But continuing to innovate for almost two centuries comes with its challenges. Beyond the many technological advancements to adapt to, consumers today have more power than ever to choose the brands and products they prefer. Companies like BT have to compete not only on performance and features, but also on the quality of user experience. To keep up, BT has had to look internally, re-evaluating how teams work together to deliver better products for customers.  </p><h2 id="the-evolution-to-a-product-squad-model"><a href="#the-evolution-to-a-product-squad-model">The evolution to a product squad model</a></h2><p>The first step to BT’s transformation was redesigning how teams build and ship products. The product, engineering, and design teams were re-organized into a product squad model, where smaller, more flexible teams were formed to own end-to-end delivery of their product. For the first time, a designer’s team wasn’t just made up of fellow designers; teammates included product owners, engineers, content designers, and others.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?rect=2,0,3996,3000&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c7cd03963caee33e9e63615206040b7be433d224-4000x3000.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>BT’s designers developing a new digital brand identity</figcaption></figure><p>While the product squad model encouraged a more collaborative approach, it shined a light on workflow issues—too many different tools, inefficient processes, and communication hurdles. “We were juggling docs, Sketch, InVision, Jira, and many other tools,” said Head of Design Operations Matt Gottschalk. “We spent more time moving content and design files between tools and managing multiple feedback streams than on the design work itself. When processes aren’t streamlined, it’s hard to collaborate and design cohesively across teams and multiple product lines.”</p><p>To help alleviate some of these challenges, the design operations team started a re-evaluation of their design organization’s tools. </p><h2 id="migrating-to-figma"><a href="#migrating-to-figma">Migrating to Figma</a></h2><p>With over 180 designers, the design operations team had to thoughtfully pilot Figma and other tools to get buy-in. They started by testing Figma with one product squad over a two-month period. Within a few weeks, that product squad started to report back positive feedback. “The squad found it easier to collaborate in real-time,” Gottschalk said. “Design hand-offs became easier, and we stopped having to move design files from tool to tool. We just designed, prototyped, and presented design work all from one place.”<br/>But it wasn’t just designers who benefited. Product owners, and engineers had more visibility into design work, allowing them to provide input earlier in the process. “Figma removed silos within our product squads and enabled the rest of the product squad to be part of the design process,” Gottschalk said.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/103fd7ac9b0bc3878c8425a2a0e5d7822e12a3ac-900x506.jpg?rect=0,0,899,506&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/103fd7ac9b0bc3878c8425a2a0e5d7822e12a3ac-900x506.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/103fd7ac9b0bc3878c8425a2a0e5d7822e12a3ac-900x506.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/103fd7ac9b0bc3878c8425a2a0e5d7822e12a3ac-900x506.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/103fd7ac9b0bc3878c8425a2a0e5d7822e12a3ac-900x506.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 899w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Content writers edit in-line with design</figcaption></figure><p>After the pilot, BT rolled out Figma across all product squads.

Via a simple link, stakeholders can now view and comment on in-progress design work from any device. </p><p>“With Figma, every product squad and its stakeholders are able to work more closely towards a shared goal,” Gottschalk said. “This has enabled the squads to ship new products and features faster and feel more confident in their decisions.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/504ecc76c44b359af9c1a96f4273e1390e5de821-1600x826.png?rect=0,0,1599,826&amp;w=670&amp;h=346&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/504ecc76c44b359af9c1a96f4273e1390e5de821-1600x826.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/504ecc76c44b359af9c1a96f4273e1390e5de821-1600x826.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/504ecc76c44b359af9c1a96f4273e1390e5de821-1600x826.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/504ecc76c44b359af9c1a96f4273e1390e5de821-1600x826.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/504ecc76c44b359af9c1a96f4273e1390e5de821-1600x826.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The entire product squad can jump into a Figma file together</figcaption></figure><h2 id="more-than-just-collaboration"><a href="#more-than-just-collaboration">More than just collaboration</a></h2><p>While collaboration was the most immediate benefit BT saw with Figma, they started to realize other key benefits:  </p><ul><li><strong>50% cost reduction:</strong> Because Figma was able to replace Sketch and InVision, BT was able to consolidate design tools and reduce costs by 50%.</li><li><strong>A seat at the table:</strong> With stakeholders having more visibility into the design process, design is now more often at the forefront of business decisions and investments.</li><li><strong>More design consistency:</strong> BT doesn&#39;t yet have a centralized design system across brand, product, and multiple business units. Figma will provide them the opportunity to create a centralized design system which will enable them to build more cohesive products efficiently.</li><li><strong>Business continuity:</strong> Even though COVID-19 has unexpectedly forced BT employees to work remotely, Figma has become one of the tools where teams can congregate together to exchange ideas and solve problems.</li></ul><p>“Figma has been a game changer for us,” said Conor Ward, Digital Design Director. “Not only are we so thankful to have moved to Figma before COVID-19, being able to design and visually communicate together on the web has become a necessity to maintain innovation.”</p><p>Today, BT employees from all different departments are signing onto Figma every day to create and collaborate. “The speed of creativity and the ability to have a shared understanding has made us all full believers in Figma” said Ward. “Instead of spending time creating polished presentations, we now do &#39;experience walkthroughs&#39; with our CEO in live design files. This way of working has revolutionised our team’s efficiency and transparency.”</p><p>To learn more about how BT redesigned how they design, check out <a href="https://medium.com/bts-design-team">BT’s Design Team blog</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How Clearstep simplifies the experience of finding care online</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-clearstep-simplifies-finding-care/</link>
      <description>The team at Clearstep shares how they designed their symptom checking and care routing platform.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Consumers have come to expect an intuitive, user-friendly experience in industries like retail, transportation, and banking, but healthcare has fallen behind. Finding the best next steps for care when you’re sick has historically been an overwhelming task.</em></p><p><em>That&#39;s why Clearstep set out to overhaul the healthcare experience—making it actionable, intuitive, and comforting.</em></p><p><em>Below, <a href="https://twitter.com/petegarber?lang=en">Peter Garber</a>, one of Clearstep&#39;s co-founders and Head of Design, and <a href="https://twitter.com/goingglacial?lang=en">Annie Kramer</a>, VP of Product Engineering, share how they built their symptom checking and care routing platform: testing user flows, managing custom branding, and refining text and color styles, all while keeping the development team up to date.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="1RZuk-oU1VLW" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Think about the last time you didn’t feel well and Googled your symptoms. What were the first thoughts that came to mind? If they were anything like the feelings of dread, uncertainty, and anxiety that most people experience when they search for health advice on the internet, you’re not alone. Finding the best next steps for care when you’re sick has historically been an overwhelming task. That’s why we at Clearstep set out to overhaul the experience.</p><p>In 2018, we shipped a symptom checking and care routing platform, enabling patients to determine whether or not to seek care and what type of healthcare provider to see for their symptoms. Along the way, the team added functionality for intelligently pairing users with convenient care resources (accounting for a user’s location and insurance network), generating cost estimates based on the user’s insurance plan, and scheduling care right from the Clearstep symptom checking platform. </p><p>Working with a small team on features that affect thousands of patients and their healthcare choices is no small undertaking, which is why speed and accuracy of our design process is instrumental to our success. There’s a ton of important resources and features for us to show and we need to get the experience right every time. </p><h2 id="tons-of-information-no-room-for-errors"><a href="#tons-of-information-no-room-for-errors">Tons of information, no room for errors</a></h2><p>Building all the functionality we needed—symptom checking, provider matching, insurance eligibility checks, cost transparency, scheduling—in one experience required multiple iterations. The team was constantly thinking about how to guide the patient through symptom checking and comparing relevant care options in a way that felt actionable and intuitive.</p><figure></figure><p>While perfecting the user flows took quite some time, features like Smart Selection made monotonous work simple; reordering care options in the symptom checker results view, for example, was as simple as dragging and dropping.</p><figure></figure><p>Typography and text editing also required multiple rounds of iteration and user testing. While some differences in the presentation of headers and body text seemed subtle, they ultimately affected how users navigated symptom checking and evaluated care options. Button text automatically resizes, so we could easily test different copy options, ultimately saving time for other design tasks that require a higher cognitive load.</p><p>Clearstep licenses its symptom checking and care routing platform to health systems, enabling their patients to navigate care resources. In doing so, we often produce briefs to showcase a white-labeled version of our technology with customer branding. We have numerous customers requiring different color palettes, so we have to quickly build custom implementations. </p><p>When Peter shares a client brief, he creates a new Figma file in the team’s workspace and can quickly add the brand’s colors to the document colors. If he needs to adjust colors on an advertisement or mockup, he can make multiple changes at once with Color Styles. If he likes the way those styles look, he can add them to the file&#39;s Library so all editors have access.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="working-remotely-together"><a href="#working-remotely-together">Working remotely, together</a></h2><p>With Figma’s multiplayer functionality, Annie can work on handoff while Peter edits designs. She can jump in and flag opportunities for UX improvement or edit designs directly. If we agree on a change to a file’s text or colors, Peter can edit and publish those styles so everything stays up-to-date for Annie whenever she pops back into the file. Once we’re ready to share with the rest of the team, Peter can create a link to the prototype so they can see changes in real time, right in their browser.</p><p>Working remotely always presents a unique set of challenges, but color-coded and named cursors allow team members to provide feedback without having to screenshare and present over a video call. When Annie’s walking through a feature, Peter can click on her avatar and go into observation mode to follow along.</p><p>Commenting also streamlines feedback. Peter can review comments one by one and address the feedback by either responding to the comment itself or resolving it and making a change to the UI.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="from-design-to-implementation"><a href="#from-design-to-implementation">From design to implementation</a></h2><p>Once the symptom checker and care routing designs are refined and finalized, it&#39;s time for to implement those designs. Features like Color Styles, the Code panel, and labels specifying offsets between UI components all help Annie and the Clearstep engineering team bring the designs to life. </p><p>This process allows us to avoid clunky conversations about transferring and downloading the assets used in designs. With Figma’s export functionality, Annie and team can maintain their workflow, accessing assets on the fly as they implement designs.</p><h2 id="accessing-healthcare-should-be-easy"><a href="#accessing-healthcare-should-be-easy">Accessing healthcare should be easy</a></h2><p>Navigating healthcare should be simple and intuitive. With Clearstep, our hope is that consumers can spend less time worrying and searching the internet for answers, and more time getting resources and guidance. We’re excited to keep building on our platform to help people find the right care when they need it most. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="_mHR46IcAQ9n" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em>You can <a href="https://www.figma.com/customers/">check out more about our customers here</a>, or get in touch with a product expert at sales@figma.com.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to evaluate design tools</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-evaluate-design-tools/</link>
      <description>A framework for project managing, testing, and choosing a design tool, based on what we’ve heard from our users.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We spend so much of our time learning and using tools. Whether it’s file storage and project management or text editors and chat, tools can make or break our workflows.</p><p>If they’re not well-suited to your team, tools can cause a host of issues: draft conflicts, inconsistent designs, and a general breakdown in collaboration. While they exist to simplify the way we work, the wrong tools can end up making things messy and complex. </p><p>To find the right fit, it’s not just about reading countless articles and reviews to identify the “best in class” option. Rather, there are a number of considerations—team size, distribution, workflow—that should inform the decision. Below we’ve outlined a framework, based on what we’ve heard from our users.</p><p>Here’s a quick look at what we&#39;ll cover:</p><ul><li>Phase 0: The groundwork</li><li>Phase 1: Discovery</li><li>Phase 2: Evaluation criteria</li><li>Phase 3: The shortlist</li><li>Phase 4: Testing</li><li>Phase 5: The decision</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6da6def4701486f081d8283432262406943a9ad7-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;h=180&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6da6def4701486f081d8283432262406943a9ad7-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6da6def4701486f081d8283432262406943a9ad7-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6da6def4701486f081d8283432262406943a9ad7-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6da6def4701486f081d8283432262406943a9ad7-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6da6def4701486f081d8283432262406943a9ad7-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>While it can be tempting to start comparing features right away, remember that this is something you and your team will be using on a daily basis; doing the upfront work to thoughtfully evaluate different tools will save you time and money down the line. </p><h3 id="treat-it-like-a-project"><a href="#treat-it-like-a-project">Treat it like a project</a></h3><p>Try to treat it as you would a product launch or design sprint, and build it into the team’s quarterly plan. The Intercom team shared <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/design-team-switching-to-figma/">their philosophy</a>: “Depending on the size of your design team, you may not be able to flip a switch and head over to new software immediately. The more complex your org is, the more important it is to pick the right approach. We tackled the problem in the same way as any other work project, which helped to ensure everything is thought through well.”</p><h3 id="set-a-timeline"><a href="#set-a-timeline">Set a timeline</a></h3><p>Make space for the process in whichever project management tool you use, and build a workback schedule based on your team’s other priorities. It may depend on the size of your organization, but prepare for it to take roughly a month (two weeks of prep and a two-week sprint to try it out on a couple short-term projects). The Intercom team also found that it’s helpful to <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/design-team-switching-to-figma/">set a hard deadline</a>—if it’s clear that one tool rises above the rest within a month, then you don’t need to complete the rest of the evaluation process. </p><h3 id="know-your-stakeholders"><a href="#know-your-stakeholders">Know your stakeholders</a></h3><p>Before you start, it’s important to chat with your team, cross-functional partners, and project approvers about the process. Of course you want to find the right tool for your immediate group, but there are other partner teams to consider as well. Think about the different projects that your team’s involved with, write down a list of others who might be impacted, and make sure to connect with them before kicking off the process. </p><h3 id="consider-a-formal-working-group"><a href="#consider-a-formal-working-group">Consider a formal working group</a></h3><p>Lyft put together an Advocates Program, made up of a cross-functional team to help with both the selection and implementation of their design tool. The group had a 30-minute, bi-weekly check-in and a dedicated channel in Slack, and encouraged people across teams to get in touch if they had feedback or questions about the design tools they were evaluating.</p><h3 id="document-everything"><a href="#document-everything">Document everything</a></h3><p>While it’s important to have an evaluation criteria—more on that below!—a large part of the decision will come down to how it plugs into your team’s workflow. Beyond keeping track of milestones and formal feedback from other groups, create a shared document where team members can write their off-the-cuff thoughts on what it’s like to use the tool in practice. Kick things off with <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/855963545846345409">this Figma file</a>, which has some prompts to get the conversation going.</p><h3 id="set-expectations"><a href="#set-expectations">Set expectations</a></h3><p>Keep in mind that implementing a new tool often requires an adjustment period. Communicate with your stakeholders and let them know that once you’re in the implementation phase, your team may need a few weeks of ramp time before they’re operating at full speed again.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4863b3cc3f896fae0a2df026e5d80a2e2f00a01-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;h=180&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4863b3cc3f896fae0a2df026e5d80a2e2f00a01-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4863b3cc3f896fae0a2df026e5d80a2e2f00a01-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4863b3cc3f896fae0a2df026e5d80a2e2f00a01-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4863b3cc3f896fae0a2df026e5d80a2e2f00a01-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4863b3cc3f896fae0a2df026e5d80a2e2f00a01-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>If you’re considering a new tool, you likely have some contenders in mind. Before you throw around names of specific tools, sit down with your team and make sure you’re clear on what you’re really solving for. </p><h3 id="define-what-matters-to-you"><a href="#define-what-matters-to-you">Define what matters to you</a></h3><p>Think about the characteristics of your immediate group. How big is the team? Is it growing quickly? Are they all in one office, or do some work remotely? Based on the answers to the above, you’ll be able to figure out what matters most to you. For example, large teams may care more about consistency and scale (think shared libraries and design systems) than their smaller counterparts; if your team is growing quickly, remember that you’ll constantly be onboarding new people; in a remote workforce, collaboration and communication will likely be top of mind. </p><h3 id="identify-painpoints"><a href="#identify-painpoints">Identify painpoints</a></h3><p>At this point, you already have a tool, and you have a good idea of what’s working and where there’s room for improvement. Have your team think about the painpoints they experience and ask them to write down the specific moments (e.g. developer handoff) where something breaks down. Get input from people outside of your direct group as well—product managers, developers, and marketers may all provide context that you otherwise wouldn’t consider. <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/826849235179549507">This Figma file</a> is a good jumping off point.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1ca4bd2db81c0125223242ec2355056e046fe37-2120x695.png?rect=2,0,2117,695&amp;w=670&amp;h=220&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1ca4bd2db81c0125223242ec2355056e046fe37-2120x695.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1ca4bd2db81c0125223242ec2355056e046fe37-2120x695.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1ca4bd2db81c0125223242ec2355056e046fe37-2120x695.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1ca4bd2db81c0125223242ec2355056e046fe37-2120x695.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1ca4bd2db81c0125223242ec2355056e046fe37-2120x695.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Based on what you came up with above, decide on a handful of themes that are most important to you and your team. Here are some we’ve seen come up in conversations with our users:</p><ul><li><strong>Productivity</strong>: Whether it’s solo work, sprint planning, design critiques, or developer handoff, think about the workflows you have down, which could use some work, and how this tool might fit into to those considerations. The right tool can speed up slow processes and materially improve efficiency.</li><li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: While you may be looking to address a specific part of your workflow, it’s important to think about your team’s broader tool landscape, even beyond design tools. Take note of the whole ecosystem—file storage, project management, chat—and think about whether this design tool replaces or supplements your existing setup.</li><li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Every team has a different way of working, and you want to make sure the tools fit into the rhythm your team is used to. This ties in to the specific characteristics that you outlined earlier. Whether you’re all in one office or managing teams across timezones, some tools will be a more natural fit for your particular structure.</li><li><strong>Security and reliability</strong>: Security is a crucial part of evaluating any tool, but larger organizations often require admin controls and visibility into team activity. If someone in the IT department is one of your approvers, make sure they’re able to weigh in on must-haves early in the process.</li><li><strong>Switching costs</strong>: It’s not just about monetary cost—you’ve likely spent a lot of time and energy implementing your existing tool, and your team may see a dip in productivity as they get up to speed on a new one. But try to think about long-term value, instead of adding up short-term spend. It’s possible that improved workflows down the line outweigh the initial, momentary drop in productivity. Don’t forget to factor in the cost of any tools that this new one might replace.</li><li><strong>Scale</strong>: Some tools are better suited for individuals or smaller teams, while others can more easily scale to fit larger organizations.

If you’re looking to see how different tools stack up, the <a href="https://uxtools.co/tools/design/">comparison charts from UX tools</a> might be helpful. Beyond those non-negotiables, try not to prioritize sheer functionality. The decision should rarely come down to whether a tool does or does not offer a specific feature.</p><h3 id="think-beyond-the-tool"><a href="#think-beyond-the-tool">Think beyond the tool</a></h3><p>To get more context on the tools themselves, it’s often helpful to learn more about the companies that build them. Teresa Man, a designer at Superhuman, says that they looked out for a tool that “echoes how we think of product, design, and culture.” You can also read through company blogs and try to get a sense of their development strategy. Look for signs that the company ships features quickly and takes customer feedback to heart. Carousell, a recent Figma-convert, describes how <a href="https://medium.com/carousell-insider/weve-moved-carousell-s-product-design-team-from-sketch-to-figma-5f7645a18b28">they decided to make the switch</a> only after <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-auto-layout/">Figma launched Auto Layout</a>. In the decision-making process, the future roadmap of the tool can be more important than its current functionality. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e70408296c21865e3efeb7a725c3e1e09c9775d4-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;h=180&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e70408296c21865e3efeb7a725c3e1e09c9775d4-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e70408296c21865e3efeb7a725c3e1e09c9775d4-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e70408296c21865e3efeb7a725c3e1e09c9775d4-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e70408296c21865e3efeb7a725c3e1e09c9775d4-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e70408296c21865e3efeb7a725c3e1e09c9775d4-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>You can read countless reviews, but the main thing is testing how it works for your team. You already have a list of painpoints that your current tool doesn’t solve (or maybe even causes). The goal with testing is to get as much signal as possible on whether the new solution addresses those painpoints, and to document any new points of friction that get introduced.</p><h3 id="build-a-framework"><a href="#build-a-framework">Build a framework</a></h3><p>Based on the criteria you prioritize, it may be helpful to create a framework around it. Lyft broke theirs out into four areas: designing the work (i.e. design quality and extensibility), organizing the work (i.e. clarity and searchability), connecting the work (i.e. collaboration and portability), and quality of the tool (i.e. reliable and performant). From there, they created a table comparing the the tools they considered, marking each with red (no), yellow (not always), and green (yes).</p><h3 id="personal-test"><a href="#personal-test">Personal test</a></h3><p>When the Intercom team was considering a switch to Figma, two designers decided to <a href="https://www.intercom.com/blog/design-team-switching-to-figma/">test the tool</a> on a few projects before getting feedback from other members of the team. Doing so allowed them to screen for any problems that would significantly impact the group’s collective workflow. They clarified that any new tool results in “inevitable moments of frustration,” but anything beyond the initial learning curve should be noted.</p><h3 id="team-trial"><a href="#team-trial">Team trial</a></h3><p>Once the designers at Intercom decided that there weren’t any major disruptions, they rolled it out to the broader design team and asked that each team member try it out on at least one project. If you can, get varied feedback: have a few members of the team work remotely, collaborate with some of your cross-functional partners, and switch up the types of projects you’re working on.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8c9b283609aa8832ce449bc326cbc257f4df7b29-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;h=180&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8c9b283609aa8832ce449bc326cbc257f4df7b29-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8c9b283609aa8832ce449bc326cbc257f4df7b29-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8c9b283609aa8832ce449bc326cbc257f4df7b29-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8c9b283609aa8832ce449bc326cbc257f4df7b29-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8c9b283609aa8832ce449bc326cbc257f4df7b29-2120x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>After you’ve run a test with each of the contenders, revisit the evaluation criteria and ask your team to grade each tool. You’ve already chosen your top three criteria (e.g. collaboration, productivity, security &amp; reliability), so narrow down the list based on that. If you’re still stuck between two vendors, broaden the criteria to include the whole list. Try to be open—it’s entirely possible that your initial hypothesis is wrong, or that your old tool is actually the best fit.</p><p>Once you’ve arrived on a winner within your immediate team, go back to your stakeholders and approvers and get their input.

      <description>Three tips on involving engineers early, from a product designer at Coda.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Editor’s note: The following is a recap from a presentation that product designer <a href="https://twitter.com/helenajar">Helena Jaramillo</a> recently gave. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uC4eZs5yj1E&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=148">watch the full presentation</a> on YouTube or <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/839644505292586256">grab a copy of the presentation slides here</a>.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="6XpVx2TgXAUV" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>I’ve been designing software in different parts of the world for the past six years at places like Google, Transferwise, and Khan Academy. I’m currently at Coda, where we’re building a new kind of doc that combines word processing, spreadsheets, and app-like capabilities so you can do things that range from taking notes to creating your own processes and workflows.</p><p>As product designers, we often hesitate to share our work early on, especially with our developers. In my experience, knowing how and when to collaborate with others plays a large factor in a project’s success. Here’s a look at how I’ve worked to bring engineers into the design process as early as possible.</p><h2 id="technical-knowledge-can-guide-ideation"><a href="#technical-knowledge-can-guide-ideation">Technical knowledge can guide ideation</a></h2><p>In the past, I’ve said things like, “I need time and space to create. I’m a creative.” Or, “If I share this mock, they’ll build it right away,” and I don’t want us to immediately get focused on a solution. But over the years, I’ve learned how to better work with engineers to understand the constraints a lot faster and, as a result, build more thoughtful solutions. </p><p>This ideation part of the design process—when you’re trying to understand constraints and come up with ideas—is when it’s especially important to work closely with engineers. Engineers are really great at ideation because they have so much technical knowledge that they can help guide you in those constraints and flag when something unexpected might come up. When you have all of those edge cases right away, then you can build more thoughtful solutions. </p><h2 id="how-to-involve-engineers-early"><a href="#how-to-involve-engineers-early">How to involve engineers early</a></h2><p>How do you actually go about doing that? Let me walk through one of the features that we built last year at Coda called Packs Tables. </p><p>We had a broader engineering team working on this, but it’s helpful to have one engineering partner who’s going to be there with you throughout the whole thing to collaborate closely and brainstorm. In my case, that engineering partner was Gil. The feature we were building, Packs Tables, allows you to pull in data from apps like Spotify, Google Calendar, and Gmail directly into a Coda doc. You connect to the app with your account and pull in data such as my playlist from Spotify, my calendar events, and so on. </p><p>Here’s mine from Spotify:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/66791294060fa9c5b7af0f1c7148239319e5ded1-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1280w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>A feature like this is very technical. Since we were working with APIs from different apps, we had to come up with something that would work across all of them. There are three things we did to arrive at that solution: created straw man mocks, brainstormed new ideas, and defined key questions.</p><p>Here’s a look at each one:</p><h3 id="_1-start-with-straw-man-mocks"><a href="#_1-start-with-straw-man-mocks">1. Start with straw man mocks</a></h3><p>You may have heard of a straw man proposal, which is essentially a write up or written brief that’s used to generate discussion and to ask questions. Straw man mocks are the visual equivalent of that—they can be simple and fairly uninformed. They’re more about asking key questions and addressing your assumptions and less about nailing down every single detail. The idea is that they should:</p><ul><li>Be quick to make. You don’t want to spend a ton of time on them because your ideas at this point frequently include misconceptions.</li><li>Ask more questions than offer solutions.</li><li>Show variety versus narrowing in on a single thing.</li></ul><p>Start by asking yourself how the project would look if it were easy and how it would work. As you’re walking through these mocks with your engineer, proactively drill deeper with questions like:</p><ul><li>What are your biggest misconceptions?</li><li>What are you missing that you haven’t thought about yet?</li><li>What is an interesting direction we might take?</li><li>What are difficult directions we might take? It’s not to avoid those directions, but it is helpful to hear what engineers find difficult so you can understand those trade offs.</li></ul><h3 id="_2-brainstorm-new-ideas"><a href="#_2-brainstorm-new-ideas">2. Brainstorm new ideas</a></h3><p>At this point, it’s still early in the process. While you have straw man mocks and your own assumptions, it’s still important to brainstorm with others and visualize new ideas. As designers, we have the skill of being able to bring ideas and questions to life—we do that sometimes for our own ideas, but it’s also helpful to do that early on with your teammates. </p><p>To visualize ideas with our engineering partners, we use a wireframing kit. At Coda, we have all our components ready to go, so we actually design in high-fi quite a bit (unless we’re designing something completely new). In today’s world, with so many of us working remotely, you can also just point your camera to a pen and paper or screenshare on an iPad.</p><p>During the Packs Tables process, Gil and I used whiteboarding to get specific about the questions we had and draw out some UI. Again, because it’s still early at this stage, we weren’t trying to design the UI. Still, we wanted to make sure that we were on the same page about ideas and potential problems.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7bb5935b0973fda273eabab996d90111d5ec21d7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1280w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Gil, my engineering partner, helping me whiteboard new ideas</figcaption></figure><h3 id="_3-define-your-key-questions"><a href="#_3-define-your-key-questions">3. Define your key questions</a></h3><p>Key questions help you answer all the little questions down the line. You can think about them as established principles; they’ll help you make sure you’re tackling the problem in the right order. They’ll also empower you to make decisions faster and ensure that you’re not debating solutions from the beginning. </p><p>Here’s a quick non-product example: You’re planning an event and someone asks, “Should you get custom napkins?” Prior to answering this question, you should have thought about your budget, time and resources, and the feeling of the event. The answers to those key questions directly inform your napkin decision. </p><p>Gil and I would come up with the Packs Table key questions during our brainstorms and keep track of them in a Coda doc. Then we’d get on a call with all the engineers working on this project and run through each of the questions and the options—we wanted to make sure the team agreed that these were the most important questions to answer (this is also a great opportunity to engage with the rest of the team).</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3665079907be679064f8bb86576cfcd7c9d4a1c7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3665079907be679064f8bb86576cfcd7c9d4a1c7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3665079907be679064f8bb86576cfcd7c9d4a1c7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3665079907be679064f8bb86576cfcd7c9d4a1c7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3665079907be679064f8bb86576cfcd7c9d4a1c7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3665079907be679064f8bb86576cfcd7c9d4a1c7-1280x720.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1280w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Our Coda doc to keep track of some of our questions</figcaption></figure><p>It’s not enough to send a project proposal around from one siloed team to another and expect success.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Editor’s note: The following is a recap from a livestream presented by Segment’s Senior Manager of Product Design, <a href="https://twitter.com/hareemmannan">Hareem Mannan</a>, where she shares real examples of how Segment co-designs in unexpected ways with researchers, product managers, engineers, and others.</em></p><p><em>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537rbDd1MpA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1804">watch Hareem&#39;s full presentation on YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ZxvlR4V6AuwULrYZ5qPKTg/Hareem-from-Segment%3A-Co-designing-presentation">grab a copy of her presentation slides here</a>.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="LI_GUUN9QATS" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>I want to start off by asking a somewhat existential question: what does it mean to design? When I describe my job to someone not in tech, people think I design “logos and stuff.” To demonstrate how design is more than that, I typically launch into a full explanation of the design process—how we generate ideas, validate them, talk to users, etc. </p><p>By the end of it, they come to the conclusion that I design &#34;mocks.” It’s technically accurate. My main output is indeed “mocks.”</p><p>But as we all know, design is a lot more than designing mocks. It can be designing delight, joy, culture, process, and community. And designing these types of experiences relies on co-designing not just with designers but with teammates across your entire company. </p><p>To illustrate what this looks like, here are a few real examples of how we co-design (outside of just mocks!) with teammates at Segment:</p><h2 id="mapping-our-customers-journey-with-ux-research"><a href="#mapping-our-customers-journey-with-ux-research">Mapping our customers’ journey with UX research</a></h2><p>To better understand the product experience for our users, one of our designers worked with one of our UX researchers to co-design this customer journey map in Figma. Starting from discovery and sign-up to ending with scaled implementation of the product, they took the entire Segment journey and mapped out the experience for different tiers of customers.</p><p>The designers and researcher supplemented each step of the journey with analytics and created an interactive prototype with clickable customer stories. This file has become the source of truth for whenever we as an entire Segment team need to reference our customers’ experience, and as an additional bonus, a great onboarding tool!</p><h2 id="diagramming-our-data-architecture"><a href="#diagramming-our-data-architecture">Diagramming our data architecture</a></h2><p>Segment is a customer data platform, which means we have a ton of data flowing through our product. A bunch of our teammates got together—designers, researchers, customer success managers, and infrastructure engineers—to diagram all the data that’s flowing through our platform and highlighted how the data is being transformed, enriched, and cleaned. </p><p>This diagram has become a foundational component for how we build future products. It highlights where we are strong and where we should focus on improving, acting as another source of truth for our team at Segment as we think about these problems.</p><h2 id="retrospective-on-our-design-system"><a href="#retrospective-on-our-design-system">Retrospective on our design system</a></h2><p>At Segment, we have an open source design system called Evergreen. Because many teams beyond design use our design system, it’s critical for us to gather feedback from other teammates—especially from our partners in engineering—about how Evergreen is serving us as an org. </p><p>A couple of weeks ago, one of our design leads led a retrospective to gather feedback about Evergreen. This is something we would have normally done in person, but now that we’re all remote, we jumped into a Figma file instead. Using virtual sticky notes, a team of designers and engineers wrote out pain points and mapped out areas of opportunities that exist with our design system.</p><p>Not only was this exercise useful, it helped us create a framework for next quarter’s OKRs and fostered a new way of thinking about our design system. Through this process, we were able to co-design a roadmap for a path forward!</p><p>Co-designing can also help create a sense of community with others. In preparation for International Women’s Day this past March, our awesome Chief Product Development Officer planned on sending all our female-identifying teammates in EPD (Engineering, Product, and Design) a card of appreciation. In a world where we were remote, we couldn’t exactly do that the way we originally planned. So our teammates jumped into Figma to co-design and collaborate on meaningful notes  to a fellow female coworker and express how they’d like to learn from them. </p><p>We do these types of virtual cards too for birthdays, now that we can’t celebrate these special occasions in person.</p><p>While some of the above examples may challenge your definition of co-designing, I hope it provides some ideas and inspiration around how might we co-design together beyond mocks. </p><p>With that in mind, what will you co-design? Who will you co-design for? What impact could it have? I’d love to hear how you’re co-designing these days on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/hareemmannan">@hareemmannan</a>!</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="wYc2PCqowOF0" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em>You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=537rbDd1MpA&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1804">watch Hareem&#39;s full presentation on YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/ZxvlR4V6AuwULrYZ5qPKTg/Hareem-from-Segment%3A-Co-designing-presentation">grab a copy of her presentation slides here</a>.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The making of Maker Week</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/the-making-of-maker-week/</link>
      <description>An inside look at one of our favorite Figma traditions</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Twice a year, we set aside a week for everyone at the company to explore a project outside of their daily responsibilities. Unlike hackathons—which are largely built for engineering and design—Maker Week is for everyone, across teams and skillsets.</p><p>It’s also a key part of our culture. Some projects are a bit more playful (see: <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1263135345790423041">making a musical</a>), but Maker Week is really about removing the limitations of day-to-day work and giving us a chance to collaborate in new ways. We delete non-essential meetings, pause our interview processes (if possible), and relish the time to connect with Figmates we otherwise may not work with in our day-to-day roles.</p><p>While we knew things would be a bit different this year, we wanted to carry on the Maker Week tradition. With everyone working remotely, company culture is <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/keeping-that-tightknit-feeling-at-a-distance/">more important than ever</a>.  Below, we’re sharing a peek into the creative direction of our most recent Maker Week: the theme, our graphic system, and how we brought moments of delight online. A visual approach is usually reserved for external launches and events, but we knew that a thoughtful creative direction would inform the energy of the week, and ultimately what the team ended up building.</p><h2 id="setting-the-tone"><a href="#setting-the-tone">Setting the tone</a></h2><p>It was important for us all at Figma to acknowledge that Maker Week would take a different shape. Of course we would all be fully remote (more on that below!), but we also needed to come up with a visual approach that felt right for this particular moment. </p><h3 id="it-s-not-just-about-shipping"><a href="#it-s-not-just-about-shipping">It’s not just about shipping</a></h3><p>While Maker Week has never been about shipping projects or building something polished, that’s especially true now. We wanted to be clear that it’s less about the output and more about the process, to celebrate working together more than delivering an end result.  </p><h3 id="a-focus-on-helping"><a href="#a-focus-on-helping">A focus on helping</a></h3><p>Past Maker Weeks have been fairly freeform. Instead of a theme, we asked everyone to make something related to Figma in some way. This year, we wanted a north star, something that preserved the spirit of Maker Week, while also nodding to the very real difficulties happening around us. The result: “How to help one another.” </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6e265a5bdca3425f8ea0e91bdb3df54ad22e7888-1600x1200.jpg?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6e265a5bdca3425f8ea0e91bdb3df54ad22e7888-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6e265a5bdca3425f8ea0e91bdb3df54ad22e7888-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6e265a5bdca3425f8ea0e91bdb3df54ad22e7888-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6e265a5bdca3425f8ea0e91bdb3df54ad22e7888-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6e265a5bdca3425f8ea0e91bdb3df54ad22e7888-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Posters from Maker Week April 2019, when we didn’t have a theme</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-creative-direction"><a href="#the-creative-direction">The creative direction</a></h2><p>The theme provided helpful constraints and parameters to guide our design process, allowing us to conceptually dig deeper. Previously, in the absence of a theme, the brand design team would build a creative direction from scratch (which is actually much harder!). </p><h3 id="space-to-be-vulnerable"><a href="#space-to-be-vulnerable">Space to be vulnerable</a></h3><p>More than anything, our goal was to give Figmates an outlet for whatever they were feeling. Being remote actually allowed us to explore this direction more fully. It’s easy to feel distant when stuck behind a computer screen, so we really encouraged everyone to be vulnerable with each other. The upside of being remote is that there’s something freeing about it. We wondered: knowing that we wouldn’t run into each other in hall, would we all be able to share more openly?</p><h3 id="all-feelings-welcome"><a href="#all-feelings-welcome">All feelings welcome</a></h3><p>In the past, we created a graphic system that inspired people to come up with ideas about what they can make individually. This year, we designed a system in Figma for everyone to play with. It encouraged Figmates to build “mood characters,” allowing them to communicate and give a name to whatever they were feeling, then share with coworkers. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76894f36cc67d7c837ab1ec9d92716b1e3cde0c7-1920x1080.png?rect=0,0,1919,1080&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76894f36cc67d7c837ab1ec9d92716b1e3cde0c7-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76894f36cc67d7c837ab1ec9d92716b1e3cde0c7-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76894f36cc67d7c837ab1ec9d92716b1e3cde0c7-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76894f36cc67d7c837ab1ec9d92716b1e3cde0c7-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76894f36cc67d7c837ab1ec9d92716b1e3cde0c7-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The playground file we shared with Figmates</figcaption></figure><h3 id="making-the-mood-characters"><a href="#making-the-mood-characters">Making the mood characters</a></h3><p>The characters were constructed from everyday objects around our designers’s desks, things that our fellow Figmates might have lying around. We specifically chose items that we’re surrounded by at home. In doing so, we were able to imagine how our feelings could be constructed by the spaces we’re essentially stuck in. While everything still felt light-hearted, the approach needed to reflect the mixed, conflicting, and confusing moods and experiences we’re all feeling, whatever that looks like for each of us. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de6b6404154060bcf8c46ba9f7e1ad94eec5714b-1920x1080.png?rect=0,0,1919,1080&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de6b6404154060bcf8c46ba9f7e1ad94eec5714b-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de6b6404154060bcf8c46ba9f7e1ad94eec5714b-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de6b6404154060bcf8c46ba9f7e1ad94eec5714b-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de6b6404154060bcf8c46ba9f7e1ad94eec5714b-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de6b6404154060bcf8c46ba9f7e1ad94eec5714b-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Inspiration for the mood characters, based on what we have lying around our desks</figcaption></figure><p>We also wanted everyone to feel like they made something, even if they don’t have the capacity to really make anything right now.

      <title>Bringing live Figma embeds to your team’s favorite tools</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-live-figma-embeds/</link>
      <description>Now, you can embed private Figma files into Notion, Dropbox Paper, Jira, and more.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To deliver great products, designers need to work closely with their developers. But collaboration isn’t always so easy. They each spend their days in different tools, and as a result, need to dedicate additional time providing context and connecting work across platforms. </p><p>To make this workflow better, we want to help designers bring their designs to spaces where teammates can view them in context, such as product specs, project plans, or documentation. </p><p>While we’ve supported the ability to embed public Figma files into other tools for a while, many of you shared that more often than not, the files you want to embed need to remain private to your organization. We heard you. <strong>Today, we’re excited to share that you can now embed private Figma files into the tools your developers use to stay on track and ship successful products.</strong></p><p>Embedded design files streamline project communication, simplify handoff, and eliminate the overhead that comes with finding and maintaining the latest designs. Here are a few ways your product teams will benefit: </p><h2 id="product-specs-and-requirements"><a href="#product-specs-and-requirements">Product specs and requirements</a></h2><p>Developers refer to product requirements and specifications in tools like Dropbox Paper and Coda to ensure they’re building the right things. With the latest design files embedded in these artifacts, developers can access requirements and designs in context, without worrying about finding the right design file.

      <description>Tips from the Figma design team on how to spark creativity at home.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Figma, we have a channel in Slack aptly-named “Inspiration, ” where Figmates across teams highlight <a href="https://www.wolframphysics.org/technical-documents/">material on the fundamental theory of physics</a> and <a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2020/gerhard-richter-painting-after-all">museum exhibitions</a> alongside links to <a href="https://theyamazakihome.com/">home goods</a> and <a href="https://www.aimeleondore.com/blogs/news/aime-leon-dore-new-balance-827">sneakers</a>. </p><p>These days, we’re still sharing our favorite bits and pieces from the Internet, but it’s a difficult time to be creative. We don’t have to tell you that. So many of us are searching for inspiration, both in our personal and professional lives. </p><p>Knowing that we could all use a little dose of imagination, we asked members of the Figma design team to share the places they turn to for inspiration. Here, you’ll find their tips: making stickers, the power of social media, and how your camera roll can get you out of a rut.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a11f940d65c9490a13907eeb8b0f65e151cb35b5-1685x1356.png?w=670&amp;h=539&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a11f940d65c9490a13907eeb8b0f65e151cb35b5-1685x1356.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a11f940d65c9490a13907eeb8b0f65e151cb35b5-1685x1356.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a11f940d65c9490a13907eeb8b0f65e151cb35b5-1685x1356.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a11f940d65c9490a13907eeb8b0f65e151cb35b5-1685x1356.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a11f940d65c9490a13907eeb8b0f65e151cb35b5-1685x1356.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A glimpse inside our “Inspiration” channel in Slack</figcaption></figure><h2 id="less-thinking-more-doing"><a href="#less-thinking-more-doing">Less thinking, more doing</a></h2><p>While we’re likely less productive than usual, the reality is that many of us are still pouring our mental energy into work. Especially now, it’s easy to get wrapped up in a cycle of overthinking. Instead of trying to force your way through it, it can helpful to dive into something entirely different.</p><p>Whether it’s a hobby you’ve been meaning to try or a skill you’ve wanted to develop, immerse yourself in something—anything—new. “Lately, I&#39;ve been finding inspiration through new simple hobbies like collecting plants and rearranging furniture,” says brand designer <a href="https://dribbble.com/RemillaTy">Remilla Ty</a>.</p><p>Principal designer <a href="https://twitter.com/rsms">Rasmus Andersson</a> says that exploring a topic you’re interested in can be helpful: “I also find inspiration in learning about other things seemingly unrelated to design, like computer science research, music or games.”</p><p>But it doesn’t have to be about challenging yourself. Remilla says, “[I’m] going back to the things that bring me joy like making art. Lately I&#39;ve been taking time out of my day to draw and write.”</p><p>In the spirit of doing something joyful, she recently turned some of those drawings into stickers. “These type of passion projects inspire me to do work through out the week,” she says, noting that it gives her a “creative boost.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/35d3f0e738fa10395e4e3f5f62ae2fbd53f2b89c-3722x1500.png?w=670&amp;h=270&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/35d3f0e738fa10395e4e3f5f62ae2fbd53f2b89c-3722x1500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/35d3f0e738fa10395e4e3f5f62ae2fbd53f2b89c-3722x1500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/35d3f0e738fa10395e4e3f5f62ae2fbd53f2b89c-3722x1500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/35d3f0e738fa10395e4e3f5f62ae2fbd53f2b89c-3722x1500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/35d3f0e738fa10395e4e3f5f62ae2fbd53f2b89c-3722x1500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Remilla’s drawings (left) that she turned into stickers (right)</figcaption></figure><h2 id="finding-a-virtual-escape"><a href="#finding-a-virtual-escape">Finding a virtual escape</a></h2><p>One of the many difficult things about trying to be creative while sheltering in place is that the experiences that some of us turn to—traveling, art, architecture, live music—are inaccessible. </p><p>Sometimes memories can offer much-needed perspective: “I tend to sit on my phone and look through photos I’ve taken over the years,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/torihinn">Tori Hinn</a>, Creative Director. “Photography is one of my biggest personal passions and I’ll get re-energized from looking at photos I took in (literally) different times.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9c6f482dde88b721bcb9045450b9722bfa8890fa-9727x4032.png?rect=5,0,9717,4032&amp;w=670&amp;h=278&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9c6f482dde88b721bcb9045450b9722bfa8890fa-9727x4032.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9c6f482dde88b721bcb9045450b9722bfa8890fa-9727x4032.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9c6f482dde88b721bcb9045450b9722bfa8890fa-9727x4032.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9c6f482dde88b721bcb9045450b9722bfa8890fa-9727x4032.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9c6f482dde88b721bcb9045450b9722bfa8890fa-9727x4032.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A few of Tori’s favorites from her camera roll</figcaption></figure><h2 id="leaning-on-each-other"><a href="#leaning-on-each-other">Leaning on each other</a></h2><p>We know it’s important to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/keeping-that-tightknit-feeling-at-a-distance/">stay close while far apart</a>, and over the past few weeks, we’ve been thrilled to see designers <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/keeping-that-tightknit-feeling-at-a-distance/#connect-with-activities-in-figma">come together in Figma</a>. Since we can’t be out and about in the world, many of us are turning to our online communities.</p><p>Whether it’s social media, the Figma Community, or just finding helpful articles and videos online, we’re all finding inspiration in different corners of the Internet. Product designer <a href="https://twitter.com/k___e___f?lang=en">Katherine Frazer</a> likes visual organization tool <a href="https://www.are.na/">Are.na</a> because ”it’s more collaborative [than] other bookmarking sites,” and “people can openly contribute to pins.”  </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1b35012f08e3926b08b1c07bc709e1427bd03f0-1638x851.png?w=670&amp;h=348&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1b35012f08e3926b08b1c07bc709e1427bd03f0-1638x851.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1b35012f08e3926b08b1c07bc709e1427bd03f0-1638x851.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1b35012f08e3926b08b1c07bc709e1427bd03f0-1638x851.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1b35012f08e3926b08b1c07bc709e1427bd03f0-1638x851.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a1b35012f08e3926b08b1c07bc709e1427bd03f0-1638x851.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A snapshot of Katherine’s Are.na page</figcaption></figure><p>Rasmus and <a href="https://twitter.com/nlevin">Noah Levin</a>, Design Director, turn to Instagram and Twitter.“ I find a lot of inspiration in work by others,” says Rasmus. He seeks out specific Twitter accounts (like <a href="https://twitter.com/archillect/">Archillect’s</a>), while Noah uses Twitter as a way to discover more organically: “I look for designers who share interesting things on Twitter, which usually leads me to follow more people who are doing interesting things, and the cycle begins.” </p><h2 id="going-beyond-design"><a href="#going-beyond-design">Going beyond design</a></h2><p>While other designers and their work can offer a good jumping off point for some projects, it can easily become too much of the same for others. “I think the further the thing I’m looking at is from design, the more it inspires me,” Tori says. “My brain has to be more creative and work harder to make connections between the conceptual things I’m thinking about and the visuals that also want to come out.” </p><p>For Tori, that’s music and movies, while Remilla prefers shows and content “related to innovation, but [that] aren’t necessarily related to design,” specifically referencing cooking shows.</p><p>If you’ve hit a wall on a particular project, it can be tempting to search for examples to emulate. But Rasmus cautions that doing so can be a trap: “At all costs, avoid looking at work by others that is solving that specific thing. Either it becomes a bad influence (you end up with a copy-paste) or your creativity is herded into a narrow mindset.” That doesn’t mean that you can’t look to others to see how they problem solve. “Instead, I seek out stuff people have done in neighboring fields or similar-but-different problems,” he says.</p><p>Design is, arguably, in everything that we make and do. But sometimes the best way to get inspiration about the project you’re working on is to get space from it.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="AKc82Wh2TKvj" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>How inspired you feel will likely ebb and flow, and that’s ok.

A lot of people cite Cooper Design as the one who started design pairing with their generator and synthesizer model, where one designer creates a lot of ideas and another turns it into a UX flow. </p><p>Adaptive Path is another design pairing advocate with their lead and support style. This style helps level up junior designers to a lead role. </p><p>Pivotal Labs, where I previously worked, borrowed a lot from the pair programming methodology of screenshare pairing.</p><h2 id="setting-up-for-design-pairing"><a href="#setting-up-for-design-pairing">Setting up for design pairing</a></h2><p>This is me pairing (back in the days when we were in the office):</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/536c7a97ee3f50dc331d5f07bcb557d9b575f7c8-1200x737.png?rect=0,0,1200,736&amp;w=670&amp;h=411&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/536c7a97ee3f50dc331d5f07bcb557d9b575f7c8-1200x737.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/536c7a97ee3f50dc331d5f07bcb557d9b575f7c8-1200x737.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/536c7a97ee3f50dc331d5f07bcb557d9b575f7c8-1200x737.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/536c7a97ee3f50dc331d5f07bcb557d9b575f7c8-1200x737.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/536c7a97ee3f50dc331d5f07bcb557d9b575f7c8-1200x737.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1200w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>A typical pairing setup is two keyboards and two mice. We have the same image on both of our displays. In the days of Sketch, we had a cable that connected the two monitors together. Figma came along, so we didn’t have to do that anymore. We now follow each other in multiplayer mode. </p><p>To get started, you need first define each person’s role—who will be the driver and who will be the navigator. The driver has control of the Figma file, keyboard, and mouse. They’re typing, clicking, making grids, and doing the physical making—basically normal design work. But the difference is they’re thinking out loud. So the driver is saying things like “I’m going to pull the primary button here because that’s the main call-to-action” or “I think we’re going to need some helper text here because we heard in research that users get confused.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f47f89ede7f391e93b5f1d501f9dceba34ff68c-1200x740.png?w=670&amp;h=413&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f47f89ede7f391e93b5f1d501f9dceba34ff68c-1200x740.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f47f89ede7f391e93b5f1d501f9dceba34ff68c-1200x740.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f47f89ede7f391e93b5f1d501f9dceba34ff68c-1200x740.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f47f89ede7f391e93b5f1d501f9dceba34ff68c-1200x740.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f47f89ede7f391e93b5f1d501f9dceba34ff68c-1200x740.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1200w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>As the driver talks out loud, the navigator is following in observation mode. The navigator does not type or click. They’re simply following the driver and asking probing questions that would typically come up in design critiques. “I think we have a pattern like this elsewhere in our product? Our users tend to get confused here. How can we help bring more guidance?” The navigator should never be criticizing the work, but rather simply bring up questions that would have come up a week later in critique or a month later when the feature is released to users. This enables the design pair—no matter where in the world each person is located—to look for opportunities and edge cases right in the moment.</p><h2 id="a-few-tips-as-you-start-design-pairing"><a href="#a-few-tips-as-you-start-design-pairing">A few tips as you start design pairing</a></h2><ol><li>Define the problem you want to solve. You and your pair should discuss and agree on this upfront. I like to do a quick sketching session or an inspiration hunt to get us on the same wavelength.</li><li>Decide who’s going to be the driver or navigator.</li><li>Talk about how long you want to pair. 10 minutes, 1 day, 1 week—there’s no such thing as too short or too long.</li><li>Take breaks because pairing can be tiring. You’re talking, generating, and synthesizing a lot of ideas.</li><li>Swap roles as some point so you each play different roles.</li><li>Practice improv rules. This is incredibly important here because you’re generating a lot emergent ideas with another person. You want to be supportive of your pair and move the work forward. There’s plenty of time to say no later.</li><li>It’s okay if it feels weird. When you design pair, you are very exposed when someone is watching. Celebrate any weirdness and make it feel like a non-moment.</li><li>Run a mini retro at the end. What felt good? What felt off? Just have a quick conversation about it.</li></ol><h2 id="how-do-you-convince-your-boss-to-implement-design"><a href="#how-do-you-convince-your-boss-to-implement-design">How do you convince your boss to implement design pairing?</a></h2><p>One obstacle that tends to come up when designers try to pair design is making the case for it. Someone (aka your manager) is bound to ask isn’t this double the resource? Why would I put two designers on one thing when they can work on two things? </p><p>My response is that’s design pairing makes the work go faster and better. Here’s what I’ve seen happen to teams that invest in design pairing:</p><ul><li>You get instant feedback on the work in context.</li><li>You’re less likely to be distracted by Slack, email, and other interruptions.</li><li>You end up distributing a lot of knowledge in context faster.</li><li>You don’t have to document as much.</li><li>You don’t need as many meetings to set context.</li><li>You’re generating more ideas and possibilities.</li><li>You tend to catch more errors, bugs, and edge cases.</li><li>Files tend to be more organized.</li><li>You feel more confident about your design decisions.</li></ul><p>Last but probably most important, design pairing is great for team morale. And when morale is good, the work tends to be even better. If you haven’t tried pair designing, give it a go and see how it changes your team. And if you want read more, I highly recommend the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0201616416">Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change</a> which provides a lot of great tips on how to build software with people.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Inside Figma: the product design team’s process</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/inside-figma-the-product-design-teams-process/</link>
      <description>A look at the meetings, rituals, and exercises our product design team relies on to stay connected and efficient.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks ago during a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgM7Lad8TNw">webinar on remote critiques</a>, I shared a glimpse into our product design team’s process here at Figma, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/825440110390475538">subsequently linked to the deck on the Figma Community</a>. I’ve since received a few messages asking for more content like this, so I figured it’s worth expanding more on how our team works. </p><p>Historically we’ve written about <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-design-team/">hiring</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-critiques-at-figma/">critiques</a>, but haven’t yet stepped back to talk more about our overall design team process. So, consider this a deeper dive into our day-to-day: meeting cadences, rituals, and anything else that helps our design team stay connected and efficient. But first, two caveats:</p><ol><li><strong>This is about “design team” process, not “product team” process.</strong> If you’re at a company with more than one designer, inevitably you’ve realized that you’re actually part of at least two cultures at the same time. You’re both a member of the “design team” (horizontal) and the the “product team” (vertical), each with their own version of stand ups, off-sites, and activities to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/keeping-that-tightknit-feeling-at-a-distance/">bring the team closer together</a> and achieve their goals. The horizontal team helps you to maintain consistency across the product and a high quality bar, elevating the craft of design in the company; the vertical team is ultimately what ships and delivers product improvements and builds expertise within focused areas. It’s important to invest in both.</li></ol><p>The balance of these identities often changes with the size and stage of the company.  When a company is small, the design team bands closely together to distribute workloads. As it expands, designers often filter into working groups focused on specific product areas. As a mid-stage company with 10 product designers, we’re starting to notice natural tensions between these identities. Our designers are mostly embedded in product areas, but sometimes more than one, and sometimes none at all. Some designers (pre-Covid) sit with other designers, and some sit with their engineers. At our size, we’re encouraging the team to focus more energy on relationships with their product teams, and rely on our design team process to handle the rest. </p><p>This article addresses these design team processes, but does not discuss overall product team process. You can read more about our product-specific processes <a href="https://coda.io/@yuhki/figma-product-roadmap">in this article about roadmapping from Yuhki</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/skuwamoto/status/1235042668494741504">this tweet storm from Sho</a>, or <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/805270101178055648">this diagram depicting PMs and designer relationships</a> at Figma.</p><ol><li><strong>Yes, we’re in a pandemic, and it’s pretty weird.</strong> It’s impossible to ignore the effect that Covid-19 has had on teams worldwide. During trying times like these, it’s important to give each other space when personal life takes a toll. For example, during our last team meeting, I shared that I’m expecting a significant disruption in output (if we’re normally operating at 100%, maybe this is like 60%), and encouraged everyone to take days off for mental health. It’s an isolating and lonely time. But this is also exactly why I’ve found collaborating with our peers a privilege worth embracing; a healthy team process can help maintain a sense of community in the absence of more organic social connections.</li></ol><p>That said, only you can determine if your team is ready for a shake-up to your process when there are so many other things to adjust to. So please don’t read this article and jump to “we should do this!” We’re just trying to be transparent about how we work for anyone who’s curious. And while I’m writing this during a unique point in time—we can’t leave our homes to work from the office, or even share a coffee—it turns out that only a few small things in this article apply strictly to this particular moment or to a remote landscape in general. Most of the processes here should be relevant to remote and non-remote teams alike, pandemic or not.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670&amp;h=194&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/54c81612f9176fd01ef1be31e8c52f87b1380915-1525x442.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>During Covid-19 vs. after Covid-19</figcaption></figure><p>With that out of the way, here’s what you can expect: I’ve broken up the post into <a href="#weekly-processes"><strong>weekly processes</strong></a>, <a href="#monthly-and-quarterly-rituals"><strong>monthly and quarterly rituals</strong></a>, and <a href="#tips-for-running-your-own-activities"><strong>8 tips for running your own activities</strong></a>.

The 30 minute meeting consists of four parts: </p><p><strong>Weekend update (5-10 minutes)</strong>: We each go around the room and share a quick highlight or two of what we did over the weekend (if we’re using Zoom, one person starts then nominates the next person). Even if these days it&#39;s some variant of “I stayed home,” “made bread,” “played Animal Crossing,” “entertained my kid”, or “binged Westworld,” it’s still an important tradition. More than anything, it reminds us that we’re all in this together. It also starts the week on a positive note and allows us to ease into the work week.</p><p><strong>Highlights (5 minutes)</strong>: We then take a couple minutes heads down to reflect on the week prior, looking back at our calendars to remind us how we spent our time. We compile highlights in a Notion doc to celebrate the little victories. Big projects take time to ship, so it’s helpful to find ways of acknowledging notable progress, whether you made breakthrough in the design, or received some great feedback during user studies. We once toyed with the idea of having a sort of “MVP” of the week for folks who had particularly strong weeks, but that hasn’t stuck and there isn’t always an obvious candidate.</p><p><strong>Critique/meeting schedule (5-10 minutes)</strong>: We plan our critiques and team meetings ahead of time so everyone knows what to expect, and so we don’t waste time during those meetings figuring out the agenda. We go around the room again (this time taking the reverse order from who did the weekend updates) and each person decides if they have a topic they’d like critiqued during the week, and on which day. There are typically two critique slots: Wednesday at 9:30am and Friday at 2:00pm (more on that later), but if there’s an overflow of topics, we add a slot on Monday at 4:00pm or suggest they receive the critique asynchronously via Slack. If someone doesn’t have a topic, we still ask that they share their focus for the week so everyone has ambient awareness of what’s going on.</p><p><strong>Announcements (5-10 minutes)</strong>: Finally, I share company-wide announcements and updates specific to the design team. This includes topics like information about our user conference, new company policies, hiring plans and candidate progress, or even more tactical things like <a href="https://twitter.com/rsms">Rasmus</a> sharing recent changes to our design system. It’s more of an FYI than a discussion, and if there are follow-ups, we add that to the agenda for our Monday 4:00pm team meetings. Speaking of…</p><h3 id="team-meeting"><a href="#team-meeting">Team meeting</a></h3><p><strong>Who</strong>: Product designers<strong>What</strong>: Discuss and brainstorm team-wide responsibilities (canceled if no topics)<strong>When</strong>: Every Monday from 4:00 – 5:00pm PT<strong>Why</strong>: To create regular space for team discussion  </p><p>During these meetings, we cover team-wide responsibilities. Whether that’s revisiting our design principles, discussing how critiques are going, brainstorming how to up-level quality, or reviewing the previous quarter, we usually find ourselves answering more strategic questions. We also have more timely sessions—in a recent meeting, we talked about what we can do to better support other teams during this pandemic.</p><p>The topics are scheduled during the warm up, and if there’s no agenda, we cancel the meeting. We end up canceling at least 1 per month, or replacing the time slot with a critique (if there was an overflow of topics).</p><p>It should not be the sole responsibility of the design team lead to move all of this forward. Your team undoubtably has thoughtful, talented people who are well-positioned to help solve these problems. I believe the most productive and healthiest teams feel a shared responsibility to improve the team’s activities. Most of the best ideas we’ve had from the team did NOT come from me. It was <a href="https://twitter.com/nikolasklein">Niko</a> who originally suggested we revisit our hiring practices, <a href="https://twitter.com/jenny_wen">Jenny</a> who came up with better debrief templates with less bias, and <a href="https://twitter.com/mwichary">Marcin</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/shanawho">Shana</a> who’ve started thinking more about our new hire onboarding practices. Team meetings are a great time to have discussions about these type of improvements together.</p><p><strong>A word of caution:</strong> Managing conversations with a large group can be challenging. As a facilitator, it’s your responsibility to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">groupthink</a> and encourage everyone to have a voice. Above all, think about how to guide the discussion in a way that feels safe. Consider time-boxing complex topics and hearing feedback “around the room” one at a time, so that those who feel less comfortable in group settings have a designated time to speak up. You can also run written exercises with sticky notes (either physically or <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/819390795753390628">digitally in Figma</a>) and break out into smaller groups, which can feel more inviting for some.</p><h3 id="critique"><a href="#critique">Critique</a></h3><p><strong>Who</strong>: Product designers, VP of Product, and any guests the presenter chooses to invite (e.g. their PM, engineering lead, researcher)<strong>What</strong>: Review two topics (30 minutes each) per critique session<strong>When</strong>: Every Wednesday from 9:30 – 10:30am PT (Europe-friendly time) and Friday from 2:00 – 3:00pm PT<strong>Why</strong>: To move projects along, help anyone who gets stuck, and share context with the team  </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e532ec83ef9f391e244a188d7041f6641656224-1920x1080.png?rect=0,0,1919,1080&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e532ec83ef9f391e244a188d7041f6641656224-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e532ec83ef9f391e244a188d7041f6641656224-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e532ec83ef9f391e244a188d7041f6641656224-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e532ec83ef9f391e244a188d7041f6641656224-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e532ec83ef9f391e244a188d7041f6641656224-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Critiques are intentionally different than formal product reviews. They are not about making major product decisions or determining product roadmaps. Rather, they’re designed to leverage the collective skills and knowledge of the design team to help unblock designers on tricky projects, elevate quality across the team, encourage consistency in the product, and share context. We want them to feel motivating, not intimidating, and helpful, not discouraging. They should be fun, something designers look forward to.</p><p>While all ten of us on the design team are on the calendar invite, it’s considered optional—usually a few drop each each time and offer feedback asynchronously another time. As the team continues to grow, we’ll likely need to reconsider the frequency and size so we don’t feel cramped in small conference rooms. However, after getting into the rhythm of doing critiques entirely over Zoom, we’ve realized that the number of attendees is less of an issue. </p><p>If you’d like to learn more about how we run critiques, I’ve written <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-critiques-at-figma/">extensively about our critique process here</a>. There, you’ll find an in-depth look into the six different forms of critiques.</p><h3 id="cooldown"><a href="#cooldown">Cooldown</a></h3><p><strong>Who</strong>: Product designers<strong>What</strong>: Wrap up the week<strong>When</strong>: Every other Friday from 3:00-4:00pm PT<strong>Why</strong>: To relax and decompress  </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f30f00bc327baa1b3b57a6c634a7fe565f31187-1920x1080.png?rect=0,0,1919,1080&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f30f00bc327baa1b3b57a6c634a7fe565f31187-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f30f00bc327baa1b3b57a6c634a7fe565f31187-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f30f00bc327baa1b3b57a6c634a7fe565f31187-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f30f00bc327baa1b3b57a6c634a7fe565f31187-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f30f00bc327baa1b3b57a6c634a7fe565f31187-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>As Isaac Newton famously said, “What [warms] up, must [cool] down.” Or maybe he didn’t say that. But someone probably did.</p><p>Along with warmups, cooldowns bookend our time, giving us a moment to ease in and out of work. Beyond wrapping up the week, we can bond and have fun as a team. I’d say they largely break down into the following three categories:</p><p><strong>Play</strong>: Playing games or building something together. For example, we recently co-created a Figma Board Game, we drew each <a href="https://twitter.com/jenny_wen/status/1239717069941161986">other’s portraits</a> without lifting the pencil tool and guessed who was who, played bingo with feature requests, drew <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/817906485572648413">signage for our office</a>, tried to sketch pictures of our childhood house’s door frames from memory, and made alternatives to default avatars.</p><p><strong>Chat</strong>: We take time to reflect on our weeks, and ask each other “how are you feeling?” Rarely does this question get asked in groups, and when facilitated well it can provide a safe space for teams to realize it’s ok to be tired, or confused, or sad. During these times especially, it’s helpful to reflect on how everyone is adjusting to our new realities working and living so much in the same space. </p><p><strong>Learn</strong>: The intent here to teach each other something new, critique or investigate a competitive product (once we spent time together <a href="https://www.drama.app/">playing with Drama</a>), or bring in guest speakers. Admittedly we haven’t done this one as much, perhaps because the broader company has “lunch and learns” on Thursdays on everything from “how to fill out crossword puzzles” to “the basics of animation.” Still, we’d like to continue thinking about unique learning opportunities for our team that don’t otherwise happen in our day-to-day.</p><h3 id="lunch-and-coffee"><a href="#lunch-and-coffee">Lunch and coffee</a></h3><p>Finally, we like to carve out completely unstructured time together. When you’re in an office, much of this happens organically. These days, we schedule an optional “morning coffee” every day at 9:00am for folks to tune in, listen to some music, and connect. It helps to maintain some semblance of normalcy to be able to just hang out with no agenda. Conversations topics have ranged from helping Marcin pick new glasses, to admiring Heather’s extensive coffee cup collection, to enjoying a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5ENGQTNTyYcMlYH43avmdK?si=E70S8IokSgK5TA4-oFTJlA">morning jazz Spotify playlist</a> together.</p><p>When we’re together in the office, anytime a new member joins, we treat them to lunch at <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/museumfromhome/">SFMOMA</a>, which is conveniently one block from our office. We’re hoping to restart the tradition later this year when things are back to normal.</p><h2 id="monthly-and-quarterly-rituals"><a href="#monthly-and-quarterly-rituals">Monthly and quarterly rituals</a></h2><h3 id="design-all-hands"><a href="#design-all-hands">Design All Hands</a></h3><p><strong>Who</strong>: The entire design team<strong>What</strong>: An opportunity to hear from cross-functional teammates<strong>When</strong>: Monthly<strong>Why</strong>: Share what everyone’s working on  </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5fd32c18f3a0ae95da89f24dd189634f008a870b-1920x1080.png?rect=0,0,1919,1080&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5fd32c18f3a0ae95da89f24dd189634f008a870b-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5fd32c18f3a0ae95da89f24dd189634f008a870b-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5fd32c18f3a0ae95da89f24dd189634f008a870b-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5fd32c18f3a0ae95da89f24dd189634f008a870b-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5fd32c18f3a0ae95da89f24dd189634f008a870b-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>There are a lot of designers outside of the product design team at Figma. For example, we have three brand designers, three researchers, two motion designers, and four design advocates—and pretty much <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/#jobs-7j8psvvpoZEVPSMBdlqUGs">all of our teams are growing</a>. During an offsite last year we realized we needed more opportunities to collaborate cross-functionally with these different roles, so <a href="https://twitter.com/torihinn">Tori</a> (our Creative Director) and Mika (our Brand Producer) and I started organizing a monthly “all hands” for the team to get together and share what everyone is working on.</p><p>The format is simple and highly visual. We send out a Figma file a few days in advance, and each person gets a slide with their name on it to populate with highlights from their past month’s work. During the meeting, everyone has 1-2 minutes to share their slide, which—if all 22 people attend—consumes the largest portion of the one-hour meeting. With the remaining time, we either do some sort of social activity or a deeper dive into a project (like when Tori walked through the latest updates to the brand guidelines). We’ve only had a few of these so far, but they’re already proving to be a fun way to come together.</p><h3 id="offsites"><a href="#offsites">Offsites</a></h3><p><strong>Who</strong>: The product design team<strong>What</strong>: A full day of planning and activities outside of the office<strong>When</strong>: Twice per year, a small one in May, and a bigger on in September<strong>Why</strong>: To learn, bond, and brainstorm  </p><figure></figure><p>Offsites are separate from the more frequent social activities we do as a team, and they take quite a bit of planning. It’s a chance for us to get together and brainstorm the future of Figma, the direction of our design team, and reflect on how things have been going. To help plan them, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeIFKjBxeE0dBc_PGPBO4OiJ428sWkJUhzqJtFv8I3esjRy-Q/viewform">we send a survey like this</a> beforehand, gathering topics, interests, and logistical information. </p><p><strong>The smaller one</strong>: This can either look like a half day out of a <a href="https://breather.com/locations/san-francisco">breather space</a>, or, more recently, we’ve just started planning for a remote one in June. (We’re definitely looking for tips on how to run a remote offsite so please <a href="https://twitter.com/nlevin">reach out</a> if you have ideas.) Generally, the goals are similar for this as they are “the bigger one,” simply condensed a bit. It’s sort of like an extended “team meeting” meets “cooldown,” where we want some time to dream, to get to know each other better, and check-in on how things are going.</p><p><strong>The bigger one</strong>: For the first one in 2018, we went up to Cavallo Point, just north of San Francisco, by ferry. After breakfast, we had a <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/2018-Design-Team-Offsite-Public-Copy--AzZwc6fRoBqPz4y~pAs8cdgyAg-ZvOVtXuOY78WjL2SNPLc3">day’s worth of activities</a>. One tradition we started (and have since continued) is to share an embarrassing piece of work from when we first got started in design. Starting the day with something vulnerable and humbling that we can all laugh at together sets the right tone for the day of “it’s ok to make mistakes” while appreciating the growth we’ve had.</p><p>In 2019, we found a lovely <a href="https://www.peerspace.com/pages/listings/596a6a21cf70a60a01269487?sort_order=1">house in Presidio Heights</a> in San Francisco to settle into for the <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/2019-Design-Team-Offsite-Public-Copy--AzadCD4MWtgIcKr0UB7QgLcgAg-y3atHMr6mAyOrNLjQ778T">day’s activities</a>, and broke up the day with a memorable hike nearby (which was necessary because Niko suggested burritos for lunch which just about knocked us all out for the afternoon). In each of these, as our team has grown, it has become important to consider breaking up the sessions into smaller working groups and coming back together. Doing so ensures that everyone has a chance to participate effectively. </p><p>One outcome from these is usually a perspective on what the product design team thinks are the most important areas for Figma to be working on. Once we’ve identified those areas, we continue to define them in close partnership with our Product and Engineering counterparts.</p><h3 id="design-education"><a href="#design-education">Design education</a></h3><p>Figma’s mission is to make design accessible to all, and we want to see that through both inside and outside the company. Every new employee receives a copy of <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-everyday-things"><em>The Design of Everyday Things</em></a>, and goes through a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/825467304309879575">&#34;Design 101 Workshop&#34;</a> led by Tori and me. </p><p>Anyone outside design attends at least one critique (<a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Guide-for-Critique-Visitors--AzbTPlsAQnSbleVxPLmZSRqUAg-g2gEMufFNbzj3HA7psNvb">using this visitor&#39;s guide</a>) as a passive observer just to learn more about how designers work. We also offer visual design trainings during our company maker weeks, and often <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/817907605087098334">create educational posters</a> to hang throughout the office to remind people of key terms and concepts.</p><h3 id="celebrations"><a href="#celebrations">Celebrations</a></h3><p>We like to celebrate birthdays and work anniversaries in unique ways together as a team. One time we made a <a href="https://twitter.com/mwichary/status/1235447858628706304">custom keyboard for Marcin’s birthday</a>, did a <a href="https://twitter.com/nikolasklein/status/1235664037469446146">surprise flash mob for Niko’s 2 year anniversary</a>, made Heather custom coffee mugs and a digital animated card for her birthday, and I received <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/813999546176971070">handmade Magic: The Gathering cards</a>. These milestones are important to recognize so everyone knows we’re here to support each other. Plus, it’s straight up fun and memorable. I’ve always felt like when you first join a company, folks tend to do a pretty good job at celebrating and congratulating you, but for some reason it seems to stop there (short of maybe the occasional launch party). These celebrations exist throughout Figma’s overall company culture—many teams even <a href="https://twitter.com/negativespaceca/status/1249829187038466050">create digital cards in Figma</a>. I recommend investing in regular celebration to help build community and combat <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/negative-bias-4589618">negativity bias</a>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c992bb28893882c82526807d0f4fb375526f2fb-1920x1080.png?rect=0,0,1919,1080&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c992bb28893882c82526807d0f4fb375526f2fb-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c992bb28893882c82526807d0f4fb375526f2fb-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c992bb28893882c82526807d0f4fb375526f2fb-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c992bb28893882c82526807d0f4fb375526f2fb-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c992bb28893882c82526807d0f4fb375526f2fb-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="tips-for-running-your-own-activities"><a href="#tips-for-running-your-own-activities">Tips for running your own activities</a></h2><p>All of the activities listed above are processes that we’ve built for the current size, organization, and culture of our design team, and the broader company. Instead of just “copy + pasting” these tips as a framework, I encourage you to consider your team’s unique needs and come up with a set of norms and processes based on those requirements. </p><p>With that in mind, if you’re looking to refresh how your design team works together, here’s how to start:</p><ol><li><strong>Identify existing gaps</strong>: Think about what currently needs improvement, and commit to tackling one problem. Is quality not quite up to par? Consider instituting critiques as a way to reinforce healthy patterns consistently as a team. Is the team not quite getting along? Try more frequent social gatherings or opportunities to build connection. Lacking motivation? Plan an offsite to reinforce excitement about the company’s future vision.</li><li><strong>Reflect on culture</strong>: There are so many things that make your team unique, and it’s important to articulate what those are. Identify those specific traits, think about the culture you’re looking to create, and make note of what people have reacted positively to in the past. One way to start is to ask your team how they describe the company or the team to others. Once you’ve identified what makes your team unique, you can come up with ways to bring that to life in your processes. Take a look at <a href="https://twitter.com/lindadong/status/1134535877303029761">this series of photos</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/lindadong">Linda</a> and her time at Lyft. Or, another talented <a href="https://twitter.com/littlenono/status/1239639466035249152">Linda’s post from a design team offsite at HelpScout</a>. Not even knowing these teams, you can tell they’re full of humor and life. Not sure what’s at your team’s cultural center? Try <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/768174747850641472">Dropbox’s culture kits</a> as a jumping off point and read their <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-dropbox-guide-to-building-creative-culture/">guide to building creative culture</a>. Or, simply ask one another.</li><li><strong>Leverage the team</strong>: Some teams may have a dedicated design producer or ops person to help. Since we don’t, I rely on our team to define and implement processes along with me. This often creates better outcomes anyway since folks feel personally invested. If someone on your team has been looking for more leadership opportunities, give them more explicit ownership of something like critiques for a bit. Or consider rotating ownership of the meeting each quarter to keep things fresh. Try not to hold on too tightly to your own ideas; most of these meetings serve the team, so it’s important they’re bought into them.</li><li><strong>Build a routine</strong>: If you find that you need to schedule a number of ad hoc meetings, perhaps there’s a way to streamline and centralize discussion in weekly patterns instead. It’s tiring for people to not be able to predict where to go for certain types of conversations; giving them a consistent and regular cadence each week builds routine and avoids spending excess mental energy coordinating. You could also consider branding them a little (as we have with “warm ups” and “cooldowns”) to make the purpose clearer and more memorable.</li><li><strong>Be conscious of timing</strong>: Think about where people are in a given day or week. Crits are difficult too far at the end of the day Friday because people are tired and ready for the weekend. They also are tough to do on Monday early in the day because content isn’t as fresh; they may need time to settle into the work after the weekend. There also may be forced constraints, like if you’re managing a team across time-zones, or balancing times against your team’s other commitments. In certain cases, especially when first getting the timing set, we’ve had to ask people to  move conflicting commitments to make space for these meetings.</li><li><strong>Treat change as an experiment</strong>: New processes and change can be scary at first. To make the team more comfortable, frame new processes as “experiments,” and intentionally check in on them together to see if the proposed changes are working or not. One example of this is (pre-COVID) we had some debates about whether or not we should sit together as a team, or sit closer to our developers. It was a complex topic with a lot of dependencies, but by allowing the team to experiment with one or the other, it gave us permission and confidence to take risks.</li><li><strong>Manage a “queue”</strong>: We keep a queue in Notion that we use for a number of things, like maintaining team meeting and cooldown ideas for future meetings, keeping track of critique guests, and rotating note takers. People can open up the queue at any point throughout a given week, and we manage it with our Monday morning warm-ups when scheduling the weekly meetings. Keeping it one place makes it less likely that we’ll forget about an action item.</li><li><strong>Invite the rest of your company in (when appropriate)</strong>: For us this is more pronounced since we work on a design tool centered around collaboration—teaching more people about design directly relates to our business. Still, inviting others to your critiques as guests can build empathy around the complexity that comes with designing products. It can also help avoid siloing your design team too much from the rest of the company and bring balance to the trade-off between design team culture vs product team culture mentioning in the beginning of this article.</li></ol><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="vOBr07k8FpYH" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>By no means is our team process perfect. We still struggle with keeping critiques effective, having regular and productive Monday team meeting topics, and even attendance for social activities like coffees. I also think there’s a natural fatigue that comes with rituals like this, and we’ll need to learn to mix things up every once in a while to keep people engaged. </p><p>Nonetheless, I wanted to share how we work more openly in case it helps other teams, whether your team is looking to iterate on a stale process, or you’re just starting to introduce some structure. With that in mind, we’d love to hear what YOUR design team does too! So <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign">please reach out</a>, or share on Twitter with #designteamprocess to start a conversation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Figma announces Series D funding led by Peter Levine and Marc Andreessen at a16z.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dear Figma Community,</p><p>Figma’s vision is to make design accessible to everyone. As the lines between home and work have blurred over the past few months, we’ve seen more Figma engagement than ever before. In addition to interface design, customers are using Figma for tasks like visual whiteboarding, diagramming and slide creation. We’ve also witnessed the birth of new use cases like <a href="https://twitter.com/rachelbeen/status/1240106956225835008">virtual design sprinting</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/briannekimmel/status/1248008574615216128">city building</a>, and even <a href="https://twitter.com/joeycordes/status/1253383875432189958">Minecraft</a> skin creation.</p><p>Today, I’m excited to share that Figma has raised a $50M Series D round of funding, led by Peter Levine and Marc Andreessen at a16z. Existing investors Index, Greylock, KPCB, Sequoia and Founders Fund also participated. Finally, Henry Ellenbogen from Durable Capital and a number of incredible angel investors also joined the round.</p><p>This new capital will help us double down on our core design and prototyping platform to ensure Figma is the most powerful — and reliable — way for teams to create together. We will also explore new ways to serve our global community — designers and non-designers alike — by building dedicated products for an expanded set of use cases around visual communication and creativity.</p><p>Given the context of COVID-19, we’re thankful for the opportunity to accelerate our work here at Figma. If you’re interested in helping us achieve our vision, we’re hiring — please check out our <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">careers page</a>.</p><p>Stay safe,<br/>Dylan</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Postmortem: Service disruption on April 29th, 2020</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/postmortem-service-disruption-april-29-2020/</link>
      <description>The root cause of our recent service outage and next steps</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As reported on our <a href="https://status.figma.com/">status page</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1255572958199705602">Twitter</a>, a number of users were unable to access Figma at 12pm PST on April 29th, 2020. We know how disruptive it is when Figma is unavailable, especially in these times. We take downtime very seriously. While there is still more work to be done to ensure we’ve learned everything we can from this incident, we want to share details about what happened and what we did to resolve it.</p><h2 id="what-happened"><a href="#what-happened">What happened?</a></h2><p>Long story short, we exceeded the CPU capacity that our Proxy servers require to successfully establish secure connections. Our Proxy servers are primarily responsible for two things:</p><ol><li>Routing requests to the appropriate backend services that power Figma.</li><li>Negotiating secure TLS connections between you and Figma.</li></ol><p>Figma clients maintain a secure connection to our Proxy servers at all times. This connection ensures you have a realtime view of what’s happening in your files and across your organization.</p><p>Just before this incident, we restarted our Proxy servers to patch an issue that had been released the day before. At that time, our traffic was significantly higher than when we normally restart these servers in the afternoon.  As each proxy server was being restarted, clients attempted to reconnect in mass. The work required to negotiate a secure connection overloaded the CPU on some of our Proxy servers. This slowed down the time to establish a connection just long enough for clients to timeout the connection before it completed. The retries perpetuated the incident until enough clients backed off sufficiently for connections to be established successfully.</p><p>While we’ve been focused on scaling and hardening our backend services against sudden disconnects and reconnects, we missed that our Proxy servers were using significantly more CPU to establish secure connections in the brief moments following a restart than they do at other times.</p><h2 id="how-did-we-resolve-it"><a href="#how-did-we-resolve-it">How did we resolve it?</a></h2><p>We were alerted to the incident within seconds of the first request failures by our monitoring systems.</p><p>Our first instinct was to look for errors in our dashboards that indicated which type of requests were the problem. To our surprise, there weren’t any obvious errors but the total number of requests was lower than normal.</p><p>This lead us to look closer at the Proxies themselves where we saw that many connections were stuck in a “waiting” state. Upon closer inspection of the logs, we found a stream of INFO messages indicating that clients were terminating the connections while attempting to establish a secure connection.</p><p>The combined number of “active” and “waiting” connections was proportionate to the number of “active” connections before the incident. So the proxies were not overloaded due to an increase in simultaneous connections, but there was a substantial increase in the rate of connections being closed and opened due to the clients that were timing out and reconnecting.</p><p>Once we confirmed that the proxies were overloaded, we launched additional capacity. By the time the additional servers came online, enough clients had already reconnected successfully that the service was able to recover on its own.</p><h2 id="why-wasn-t-everyone-affected"><a href="#why-wasn-t-everyone-affected">Why wasn’t everyone affected?</a></h2><p>Some of our users in Europe and China connect to a separate fleet of Proxy servers outside the United States so we can route traffic more efficiently back to our servers. If you were in one of the regions where we route traffic through these proxy servers, then you were not affected.</p><h2 id="next-steps"><a href="#next-steps">Next steps</a></h2><p>We doubled the number of Proxy servers in response to this incident. We’re also updating our capacity planning with new monitoring that will alert us when it’s time to add more Proxies going forward. These immediate changes will help to prevent a recurrence of this particular incident but aren’t enough on their own to mitigate the risk of similar classes of incidents.</p><p>We also need to rethink our reconnection strategy. If our clients had waited longer before attempting to reconnect, the service would have recovered more quickly. Based on the postmortem from this incident, we&#39;re working to create a roadmap of additional infrastructure work we can do to keep Figma stable if similar conditions emerge in the future.</p><p>If you have any questions about this incident, please don’t hesitate to get in touch at <a href="mailto:support@figma.com">support@figma.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bridge design and development with the new Zeplin integration</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-zeplin-plugin/</link>
      <description>Introducing a redesigned Zeplin integration with Figma.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re a fan of Zeplin’s philosophy on collaboration and developer handoff, your design workflow just got a boost. Today, we’re introducing a redesigned Zeplin integration with Figma. <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/745330164019088593/Zeplin">Check out the new plugin here</a> and read on for more details.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="aCIAP-Cms5gO" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>For those not yet familiar, <a href="https://zeplin.io">Zeplin</a> delivers more advanced hand-off features and can serve as a bridge between design and development. </p><p>We launched the first version of the Zeplin integration even before Figma officially launched. Two and a half years later, over 300,000 files every month are exported from Figma to Zeplin. During this current WFH period, we’re seeing an increase of 30-40 percent on top of that. Being individually distributed has accelerated the need for new places to work together and connect online. </p><p>For version 2 of our integration, we wanted to improve the export experience and solve some of the performance issues. We knew building a native plugin would not only give our users a more seamless workflow, but also make it easier for our team to build, maintain, and add new features to the integration.</p><figure></figure><p>We’ve rebuilt the integration from the ground up and today, we’re excited to introduce the brand new Zeplin plugin. From Figma, you can now export frames and components, as well as color and text styles from Figma to Zeplin in a couple clicks. And in Zeplin, developers and other members of your product team can automatically generate accurate specs, assets, and code snippets. Plus, they can see exported assets directly in Zeplin’s style guides. </p><p>For users who were already using the previous version of the integration, you’ll find that exporting large Figma files and frames no longer means hiccups with performance or resolutions. For more product details, <a href="https://zpl.io/blog/figma">head over to Zeplin’s blog post</a>. </p><p>What’s most unique to the Zeplin integration with Figma versus other design tools is that Figma is on the web, which presents unique advantages. One additional feature we’re exploring to build is to automatically push any changes made to Figma components to Zeplin. More details to come on that soon. </p><p>In the meantime, check out the new integration by <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/745330164019088593/Zeplin">installing the new Zeplin here</a> or email us with any questions or feedback at <a href="mailto:support@zeplin.io">support@zeplin.io</a>. And for all Figma customers who want to give Zeplin a try, send a note to <a href="mailto:figma@zeplin.io">figma@zeplin.io</a> to get 3 months of Zeplin’s Organization plan for free.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bringing Figma to even more classrooms</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/bringing-figma-to-even-more-classrooms/</link>
      <description>Expanding the Figma for Education program to include online courses, bootcamps, school-sponsored hackathons, and more.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starting today, we’re expanding the Figma for Education program to include online courses, bootcamps, school-sponsored hackathons, and more!</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="FB8LhXYaH3Lk" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Educators across institutions, grade levels, and subjects have had to overhaul the way they teach as a result of COVID-19. Over the last few months, we’ve heard from many of them about the challenges of building and running a remote classroom, and we’re humbled to be part of that conversation. </p><p>Our commitment to education is in our DNA. Figma has always been free to get started and, over the years, we’ve quietly offered discounts to students and educators at accredited institutions; more than 100,000 people around the world already use Figma in their classrooms. </p><p>As educators and students have been focused on getting into the new rhythm of teaching and learning remotely, we’ve been making it even easier for classrooms to get up and running on Figma. We teamed up with passionate educators like Miguel Cardona from RIT to <a href="https://www.figma.com/@miggi">publish teaching materials</a> and Students Who Design to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-students-who-design-set-up-figma-in-their-online-classroom/">share a guide on how they set up Figma</a> for their online course. When it comes to inspiring and preparing the next generation of designers— especially now—we knew there was more we could do. </p><p><strong>So, starting today, we’re expanding the Figma for Education program beyond degree programs at accredited institutions to also include online courses, bootcamps, school-sponsored hackathons, and other flavors of IRL and virtual classrooms.</strong> </p><p>By applying to our program, students and educators will get access to:</p><ul><li>A free Education plan with all the features available on our Professional plan, including unlimited editors, files, and projects</li><li>Dedicated resources (like practical <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/tag/classroom_template">classroom templates</a>) focused on teaching and learning</li><li>A community of fellow students and educators and special invites to virtual events and meetups</li></ul><p>Embracing a wider range of classrooms brings our Education program more in-line with Figma’s mission of making design accessible to everyone. Whether students are pursuing an advanced degree, leveling up skills, trying to switch careers, or hoping to build a better understanding of design; whether they’re set on becoming professional designers or just taking the first step; whether we’re facing a global pandemic or not, we want to meet students where they are.</p><p>Eric Paulos, professor of Human Computer Interaction at UC Berkeley, describes the value of Figma in his classroom: “Students today are used to collaborating together online in nearly everything they do—Figma beautifully brings that rich collaborative experience to visual design.” </p><p>We&#39;re excited to see more students, educators, and classrooms using Figma. We even hired a human (that’s me, hi!) to bring this dedicated program to life. Learn more or apply for an Education plan at figma.com/education. </p><p>And, if you have more ideas on how Figma can be even better for classrooms, I’d love to hear from you at <a href="mailto:education@figma.com">education@figma.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The case for lightweight prototyping</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/the-case-for-lightweight-prototyping/</link>
      <description>Some tried and true ways to use prototypes, and an unexpected use case from the Figma team.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Prototyping is a key part of product development, allowing you to get valuable feedback on how users interact with your designs. Just earlier this month, we shared tips for <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/research-remotely/">remote usability testing</a> and announced an <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/building-on-our-open-platform-design-in-figma-prototype-with-framer/">integration with Framer</a> to bring you more powerful prototypes. (We even <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-finale-of-prototyping-week-interactions/">dedicated a week to prototyping</a> back in 2018).</p><p>Beyond getting formal product feedback, prototypes are also broadly helpful as a communication tool. You can translate your vision to a prototype, share work, and get input from other collaborators, stakeholders, and teams. Depending on where you are in the development process, they don’t always have to be high-fidelity—in many cases, informal prototypes can be more impactful than something more polished.</p><p>Here, we share the benefits of lightweight prototypes and some ways the team at Figma is using them.</p><h2 id="prototypes-in-practice"><a href="#prototypes-in-practice">Prototypes in practice</a></h2><p>It can be scary to share something that still feels like a work in progress. But inviting early feedback helps you quickly course correct (if needed) and can save you time down the road. There are a few areas in particular where building and sharing lightweight prototypes can make a meaningful difference.</p><h3 id="test-your-copy"><a href="#test-your-copy">Test your copy</a></h3><p>Prototypes can be a helpful gut check as you <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/guide-to-content-strategy-in-design-systems/">build out your UX content strategy</a>. For example, a quick look at a flow should reveal whether or not the copy in a header, body, and button all match up, and that it’s clear what action the user should take. Since you’ll likely have more than one person writing copy and microcopy, this is a good time to look out for inconsistencies with the voice of the writing. Even if you don’t have a defined style guide, getting a sense of how everything fits together ensures that the tone feels right, even if just directionally.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?rect=0,0,1600,1113&amp;w=670&amp;h=466&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae1b62aff7dc30b606ee00b5cea72fae493d94d3-1600x1114.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="add-context"><a href="#add-context">Add context</a></h3><p>While you certainly want a well-thought-out prototype during <a href="https://www.figma.com/best-practices/guide-to-developer-handoff/">the developer handoff</a>, it can also be helpful to share early thinking. Aside from giving the development team more insight into your vision, they’ll also be able to tell you if something isn’t feasible, which potential roadblocks you might hit, or if an idea will require additional exploration. Plus, remember that prototypes are a blueprint, not the end result—the more context you provide, the easier it’ll be to bring that design to life. </p><h3 id="communicate-interactions"><a href="#communicate-interactions">Communicate interactions</a></h3><p>Even when you’re building something lightweight, you’ll want to be as specific as you can, <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040315773-Build-Prototypes-with-Interactions-and-Animations">mapping out paths and interactions</a> (like On Click, On Drag, While Hovering). Doing so will help you communicate what you’re trying to build, resulting in better feedback and more accurate testing.</p><h2 id="communicating-at-figma-in-figma"><a href="#communicating-at-figma-in-figma">Communicating at Figma, in Figma</a></h2><p>In addition to using prototyping for product workflows, we at Figma use them as a communication tool. Now that we’re all remote, sharing work and information—both inside the company and with our users—is more important than ever. </p><h3 id="presentation-view"><a href="#presentation-view">Presentation View</a></h3><p>While many use cases come to mind when we think about prototypes, presentations may not be top of the list. But at Figma, we exclusively use <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040318013-View-Prototypes-with-Presentation-View">Presentation View</a> to share slide decks. </p><p>Here are some examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Running All Hands</strong>: Our company-wide meetings usually consist of many small segments led by people across teams. Whoever is presenting at an All Hands meeting jumps into a Figma file, adding slides to the master version once they’re ready.</li><li><strong>Sharing information</strong>: Whether it’s getting feedback on quarterly plans, presenting research findings, or exchanging ideas for how to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/keeping-that-tightknit-feeling-at-a-distance/">keep your team close</a> while everyone’s working remotely, Presentation View is the foundation for how we circulate information internally.</li><li><strong>Guiding customer conversations</strong>: In addition to custom pitches, our sales team has started making one-pagers for customers in Figma. Instead of copying the link to a PDF, we send them a prototype URL and ask them to click through it. This format supports animated elements like gifs, which makes it more engaging than reading a static file.</li><li><strong>Speaking at events</strong>: At <a href="https://config.figma.com/">our first user conference</a>, many of our keynote and breakout sessions speakers built their presentations in Figma, using <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/802341758899857128">this template</a>. This format also works for <a href="https://remotedesignweek.com/">virtual events</a>, especially now that so many events have moved to an online-only presence.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8fba944240b006af2a28b0c68221a8140f7a5d9d-1920x1080.png?rect=0,0,1919,1080&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8fba944240b006af2a28b0c68221a8140f7a5d9d-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8fba944240b006af2a28b0c68221a8140f7a5d9d-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8fba944240b006af2a28b0c68221a8140f7a5d9d-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8fba944240b006af2a28b0c68221a8140f7a5d9d-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8fba944240b006af2a28b0c68221a8140f7a5d9d-1920x1080.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The slide template we built for our user conference, Config</figcaption></figure><h3 id="presenting-in-figma"><a href="#presenting-in-figma">Presenting in Figma</a></h3><p>If you’re looking to build a slide deck, open a new file and create a frame for each slide—there’s even a “Presentation” setting in the device frame dropdown, which displays the prototype to a size that fills the screen, in its entirety.

      <title>How Inneract Project empowers the next generation of brown and black designers</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/inneract-project/</link>
      <description>Students&#39; stories and what they built in Figma.</description>

I saw the potential for designers of color to not only use design as a means for expression and change within their community, but also as a way to make sure the products we all see and use reflect the reality of our diverse world. And with that, my work on IP began.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae9733abab0c3f65224911d1bef2314b68608221-1600x1200.jpg?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae9733abab0c3f65224911d1bef2314b68608221-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae9733abab0c3f65224911d1bef2314b68608221-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae9733abab0c3f65224911d1bef2314b68608221-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae9733abab0c3f65224911d1bef2314b68608221-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae9733abab0c3f65224911d1bef2314b68608221-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="the-early-days"><a href="#the-early-days">The early days</a></h3><p>In the early days of our program, we decided not to use software or hardware. Instead, we focused on critical and creative thinking, what students could make using only their hands and minds on paper. This is still true in all our introductory courses—exposure to design through creative activities that we hoped would ignite passion. </p><p>As students asked for more formal design training, we built a curriculum to systematically prepare students of color, as early as middle school, to pursue a degree or career in design. Graphic design was in-demand at the time, so we built our program around those skills. Pathway to Design, as we called it, also needed to introduce software and hardware—it was critical to train students on professional-grade tools.</p><p>But design tools are sometimes prohibitively expensive, so we relied heavily on donations, purchasing as many licenses for design applications as we could. As a result, students often shared computers for their work. While this still gave them valuable exposure, we aspired for all of our students to get hands-on experience as much as possible.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1de64a838d2d22f2b3ca055e3d6f69bcb56cafbd-2880x1920.jpg?rect=1,0,2878,1920&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1de64a838d2d22f2b3ca055e3d6f69bcb56cafbd-2880x1920.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1de64a838d2d22f2b3ca055e3d6f69bcb56cafbd-2880x1920.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1de64a838d2d22f2b3ca055e3d6f69bcb56cafbd-2880x1920.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1de64a838d2d22f2b3ca055e3d6f69bcb56cafbd-2880x1920.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1de64a838d2d22f2b3ca055e3d6f69bcb56cafbd-2880x1920.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>IP students wireframing on paper before they found Figma</figcaption></figure><h3 id="finding-figma"><a href="#finding-figma">Finding Figma</a></h3><p>As the design industry evolved once more from graphic design to developing mobile apps and interfaces, so have students’ interests and, accordingly, IP’s curriculum.

Most critically to IP’s mission, Figma removed the barriers for students to learn and get hands-on experience designing. </p><p>Since Figma was free to get started, no one in the program needed to pay more to learn more. And, we were confident in our decision to teach and practice designing in Figma—it was not only friendly to beginners, but also served professional designers at companies we dreamed of placing our students in. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?rect=2,0,4895,3266&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a9c1dc827b6209b13b700127d44ce0d2b954e09-4899x3266.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>IP students designing in Figma</figcaption></figure><p>Having the tool in the browser instead of an application empowered our students to do more designing than they ever had before. Many students jumped back into their Figma files when they got home, and those who didn’t have personal computers could still access their files in public spaces like libraries and school computer labs. With just a little after-hours practice, students accelerated their learning and understanding of design. </p><p>Since bringing our coursework on Figma, we’ve also expanded our curriculum to include more collaborative projects—whether it’s within the classroom or working with volunteers and partners.</p><h3 id="our-students"><a href="#our-students">Our students</a></h3><p>By teaching design skills early, we hoped to better serve our community, prepare young black and brown students for future education or careers, and  unlock a lifetime of passion and creativity . Over the years, our programming has evolved to include single-day workshops, multi-day coursework, hackathons, partnerships with local companies and programs, and a robust (and growing!) community of our very own. Seeing our students validate that hypothesis has been an incredible source of joy and pride over the last 15+ years. Here are some examples of our students’ work:</p><ul><li>Leigh designed posters and graphics for her High School with IP and is now attending Academy of Art University for graphic design.</li><li>Saaleha graduated from University of California Berkeley and is currently seeking a career in design research.</li><li>Sierra sought to use design to solve for her grandmother’s walker, which was difficult to use on concrete. At IP, she designed a concept that serves elderly people in need of walking assistance. She also designed a mobile app for connecting artists and their fans, inspired by her love for music and entrepreneurship.</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ccceb561448439d01e19f77b292df68c0d819d8-4032x3024.jpg?rect=2,0,4028,3024&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ccceb561448439d01e19f77b292df68c0d819d8-4032x3024.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ccceb561448439d01e19f77b292df68c0d819d8-4032x3024.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ccceb561448439d01e19f77b292df68c0d819d8-4032x3024.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ccceb561448439d01e19f77b292df68c0d819d8-4032x3024.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ccceb561448439d01e19f77b292df68c0d819d8-4032x3024.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Sierra presenting her cane concept</figcaption></figure><ul><li>Noah built a digital ad campaign for an app providing support and services to homeless youth in the Bay Area.

      <description>Hands-on exercises for learning design.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), I teach New Media Design, a program that explores the many angles of digital design. When it comes to learning design, there’s no substitute for hands-on experience. That’s why I was immediately drawn to Figma—it removes the barriers between thinking, doing, and collaborating.</p><p>These are some of the activities I do with my students in Figma. Each has an accompanying Figma file that educators can duplicate and use in their classrooms, too.</p><p><strong>1. Student trading cards</strong>    </p><p>This is ideal for the first week of class because it combines a getting-to-know-your-classmates activity with a getting-to-know-Figma activity. The final outcome is a simple social media-style profile that makes use of autolayout and a few components. I like to have all students designing in the same file so they can get a glimpse of each other’s process and style. Once everyone has finished the activity, I create a page in the file that acts as a gallery. </p><p>For students who are more familiar with Figma, I encourage them to add their own questions and icebreaker components to share with other students as they build out their own profiles. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e4f41d268c79a884ffffcc7e05bc89d60ff7736c-2400x1360.png?rect=1,0,2398,1360&amp;w=670&amp;h=380&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e4f41d268c79a884ffffcc7e05bc89d60ff7736c-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e4f41d268c79a884ffffcc7e05bc89d60ff7736c-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e4f41d268c79a884ffffcc7e05bc89d60ff7736c-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e4f41d268c79a884ffffcc7e05bc89d60ff7736c-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e4f41d268c79a884ffffcc7e05bc89d60ff7736c-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><strong>Figma skill level</strong>: Beginner<strong>Key Figma features</strong>: <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040451373-Create-dynamic-designs-with-Auto-Layout">Auto Layout</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/multiplayer-editing-in-figma/">Multiplayer Editing</a><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/798962767266141877">Duplicate the file</a></p><p><strong>2.

It’s a quick and easy way to familiarize students with a handful of Figma tools that they’ll use for more advanced work down the line. As always, I like to create a gallery at the end of all students’ interpretations.</p><p>For an added challenge, students can use <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039818874-Create-Advanced-Animations-with-Smart-Animate">Smart Animate</a> to make the heart pulse.

I’ve found that this activity often leads to productive discussions about visual hierarchy and communication design principles.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ad9a98fb294b34d55eb84a43b15c85c85997b01e-2400x1360.png?rect=1,0,2398,1360&amp;w=670&amp;h=380&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ad9a98fb294b34d55eb84a43b15c85c85997b01e-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ad9a98fb294b34d55eb84a43b15c85c85997b01e-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ad9a98fb294b34d55eb84a43b15c85c85997b01e-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ad9a98fb294b34d55eb84a43b15c85c85997b01e-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ad9a98fb294b34d55eb84a43b15c85c85997b01e-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><strong>Figma skill level</strong>: Beginner<strong>Key Figma features</strong>: <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450513-Create-Layout-Grids-with-Grids-Columns-and-Rows#h_5d2961fd-4edb-49e1-96f0-057197a82014">Layout Grids</a>, <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040328653-Speed-up-your-workflow-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</a><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/831296920558364657">Duplicate the file</a></p><p><strong>5.

A grid system for presentations</strong></p><p>This exercise is a true deep-dive on grids. It’s great for teaching layout concepts like baseline, columns, gutters, margins, and modules for widescreen presentations. In preparing students to design layouts for all types of devices, and media, I start out by explaining, broadly, how layouts can be communicated with grids. For the activity, I ask students to start with layout content for a 1920×1080 presentation deck using this 14 column system.</p><p>Some supplemental materials that I recommend include Ellen Lupton’s Book, “Thinking with Type”, “The Vignelli Canon”, Josef Muller Brockmann’s “Grid Systems”, and Google’s Material Design’s “Understanding Layout” for more context. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bc200856407a05ba1d5052e343367da856ea7dc8-2400x1360.png?rect=1,0,2398,1360&amp;w=670&amp;h=380&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bc200856407a05ba1d5052e343367da856ea7dc8-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bc200856407a05ba1d5052e343367da856ea7dc8-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bc200856407a05ba1d5052e343367da856ea7dc8-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bc200856407a05ba1d5052e343367da856ea7dc8-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bc200856407a05ba1d5052e343367da856ea7dc8-2400x1360.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><strong>Figma skill level</strong>: Intermediate<strong>Key Figma features</strong>: <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450513-Create-Layout-Grids-with-Grids-Columns-and-Rows#h_5d2961fd-4edb-49e1-96f0-057197a82014">Layout Grids</a><a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/831257037874341872">Duplicate the file</a></p><p><strong>10.

Figma can export to PDF which opens up some print possibilities.</p><p>In this activity, students lay out content across the pages using the component, and then preview the instances in the second page as printer’s spreads. They’ll have to take new limitations into account like print resolution and how layouts will look in a full spread.

That group includes <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School</a>, an entirely online, live, instructor-led, 9-month program that teaches professional skills at no upfront cost to students. Lambda School has courses in Web Development, Mobile Development, Data Science, and most recently, added a UX Design program to its roster.</p><p>Lambda’s mission is to pioneer a new model of higher education. They want to enable and empower students to gain the skills, guidance, and support they need to kickstart a career in tech. As such, creating a remote-accessible learning environment that feels as connected, hands-on, and collaborative as an in-person classroom is core to their mission. </p><p>To do that, Lambda has relied on powerful tools like Figma. The team at Figma joined in for a few lessons to see Lambda in action. Here are some of the ways we observed Lambda + Figma elevating the remote teaching and learning experience. </p><h3 id="going-deeper-with-interactive-tools"><a href="#going-deeper-with-interactive-tools">Going deeper with interactive tools</a></h3><p>The Lambda UX course works like this: all of the students in the class join a video conference and the instructor shares their screen to begin the class. In a typical classroom, this is often when the students quiet down and tune in as the instructor advances her slides. In the Lambda classroom, the presentation is a two-way-street. Lessons presented in Figma invite students to go deeper. Whether it’s zooming in to get a better look at a curve, scrolling around to study a particular logo, or pinpointing what someone is talking about thanks to everyone’s visible pointers, even going through slides is a collective activity.</p><figure><figcaption>Using Figma, students can zoom in and refer to specific parts of a presentation, even as the teacher presents.</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to design activities, the benefits of collaboration kick into even higher gear. As Elizabeth Lin, a design instructor at Lambda, says, “with all our design lessons at Lambda School, we make sure that there&#39;s a collaborative element! Students are more motivated and have more fun when we’re all working together.”</p><p>Students create their designs right in Figma from the start and iterate from there. The evolution of each design is visible, providing an amazing opportunity for students to observe, learn from, and provide feedback on each other’s work while it’s still in progress. On top of that, students can remix each other’s work to build their own designs. </p><p>“In a recent class about documentation, I watched students build off of each other&#39;s designs! They used their classmates&#39; work as inspiration and were able to build and explore together,” Elizabeth described. This not only pushes students to make their work better, but also prepares them to join the professional design teams where many designers are working together to execute on a single project.</p><h3 id="side-by-side-feedback-and-support"><a href="#side-by-side-feedback-and-support">Side-by-side feedback and support</a></h3><p>For new designers, feedback is one of the most helpful pieces of the learning process. Using Figma, students can tap each other and their instructor for thoughts as they’re designing. “One of Lambda’s principles is to create collaborative communities. We want to make sure students are engaged and feel comfortable providing feedback to each other in every lesson,” Elizabeth says. This is something that feels really natural in the traditional classroom that Lambda wanted to bring to their remote classroom.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?rect=0,0,3840,2275&amp;w=670&amp;h=397&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8897345cbbeb8a34b746d8c52149a321a2d07dad-3840x2276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Students use stars in Figma to vote for another student’s design.</figcaption></figure><p>Thanks to open audio and Figma’s browser-based editor and commenting features, students can enjoy the benefits of working alongside their classmates without the pressure of feeling like they are working on top of one another.  (In one class, students even played tunes for each other while they worked).</p><p>In times when students want to work without interruption, they can design in their corner of a Figma file while still passively enjoying the benefits of the instructor or classmates observing their work-in-progress files. Onlookers can take notes for later or leave comments on the design itself for asynchronous review. When it comes time for real-time feedback, students can call the instructor or other classmates over to chime in and actually move pixels around with them in the same file. The result is a wellspring of ideas from all participants and more learning for everyone. </p><h3 id="a-permanent-record-of-work"><a href="#a-permanent-record-of-work">A permanent record of work</a></h3><p>Lambda’s mission doesn’t end at teaching people new skills. Not only does the school hold off on charging students for the program until they’ve landed a job, but they also match people with expert career coaches, local mentors, and their nationwide network of hiring partners. To show employers what they are capable of, students (especially design students) need a portfolio. </p><p>Since each student’s designs were created, iterated on, and stored all along the way in Figma, the portfolio-creation process becomes a lot easier.  Figma saves and organizes everything so students can focus on nailing the interview, not sorting through old files to piece together a portfolio. Students also have access to classmates’ work, so even after a lesson, they can continue to learn from each other.</p><p>As design continues to expand its reach and impact, we love seeing programs like Lambda School that educate and support the next generation of designers!</p><p>Learn more about <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/">Lambda School on their website</a>.</p><p>If you’re using Figma in your classroom, we’d love to see how!

      <title>Look no further: New ways to search and provide context in Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/new-ways-to-search-and-provide-context-in-figma/</link>
      <description>Announcing Universal Search and Links in the editor</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>To bring better discoverability and added context into Figma, we looked to our home on the Web for inspiration. Today we’re excited to announce <strong>Universal Search</strong> and <strong>Links</strong> in the editor. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="8W0SUtbghxVB" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>From the beginning, Figma has set out to facilitate a more open design process. In fact, it’s one of the reasons we built Figma on the Web—to create a space where design work is openly available to anyone with a computer and internet.</p><p>With over 50% of Figma users identifying as non-designers, designers have embraced working with collaborators across teams—developers, product managers, researchers, marketers, and beyond. To help these teams make the most of this open environment, we’re making it easier for designers and their stakeholders to find what they’re looking for. We’re also enabling designers to provide context and navigation within their files to help teammates understand their work. </p><h2 id="easily-find-what-you-re-looking-for"><a href="#easily-find-what-you-re-looking-for">Easily find what you’re looking for</a></h2><p>Last fall, we <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-community/#creating-communities-inside-your-figma-workspace">reoriented the Figma workspace</a> around designers and their teammates—allowing users to focus on the people and context behind the file instead of navigating by folders and file names. We introduced project, team, and organization pages as well as individual profiles, to help everyone understand the context around each project and make it easier to find each other&#39;s work. </p><p>Even with these changes we found that the more work you do in Figma and the bigger your team is, the harder it is to find what you’re looking for. To help with this, we’ve built Universal Search so that designers and their teams can more easily navigate their Figma workspace and find what they’re looking for. </p><p>Users have always been able to search for files in Figma. Now, they don&#39;t have to know the name of the file to find what they’re looking for—designers and their teammates can also search their workspace for projects, teams, people, and even private plugins. As a user types, they’ll see results in each of these areas, and can filter the results to focus on a specific category.</p><figure></figure><p>Users in the Figma Community beta will notice that their search results will also include community files, publishers, and plugins. </p><p>We’ve been rolling out Universal Search over the past few weeks, and it’s now available to all Figma users. For designers, this new experience will mean less time searching for work (for yourself, or to send to others!) and more time making. And for the rest of the team, a more intuitive way to find what you’re looking for and stay up to date on the latest design work. </p><h2 id="better-navigation-and-added-context"><a href="#better-navigation-and-added-context">Better navigation and added context</a></h2><p>Beyond helping designers and their teammates find the files they’re looking for, we also want the files themselves to be easier for collaborators to navigate. <em>Where are the latest designs? Are there early brainstorms I can look at?</em></p><p>Designers can now guide teammates through their work by including Links to any page or frame within their files. One way we’ve been using this here at Figma is by creating a clickable table of contents that orients any new visitor to the design file. </p><p>Another way links can be useful is to create an index of all relevant product docs and links in a single place. Design work doesn’t exist in a vacuum—it’s almost always part of a larger project with related docs and resources that provide necessary context but live outside of Figma. <em>Is there a related product requirements doc (PRD)? How can I learn more about the user persona we’re building this feature for? </em></p><figure></figure><p>With Links, you can now bring this additional context into Figma, connecting the latest designs with relevant requirements and specs and allowing your design files to be the single source of truth for your project.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="BphHjwcXE0gB" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We’re excited for you to try out these new features. In the meantime, if you’re interested in learning a bit more about how Links work in Figma (as well as a bit of trivia) check out our <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/832634397112145954">Links playground file</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Tips for running user interviews and debriefs when your team&#39;s working remotely</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/reflections-on-config-our-first-user-conference/">our first user conference</a> back in February, <a href="https://twitter.com/iirenekiim">Irene Kim</a>, a product designer at NPR, shared her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcV5Y7QaV4g">her tips for remote usability testing</a>. Now that we’re all working remotely, the research team at Figma is learning how to collect, synthesize, and share insights from a distance.</p><p>Like any research initiative, process, frameworks, and documentation are key. Still, there are some tweaks that make the tactics—brainstorming questions, doing user interviews, collaborating on shared boards—a little easier. Whether you’re the middle of a journey mapping exercise or looking to do some usability testing, we’re sharing a few ways to make your research work, remotely.</p><h2 id="it-s-all-about-user-empathy"><a href="#it-s-all-about-user-empathy">It’s all about user empathy</a></h2><p>Learning to see something through the eyes of your users is a cornerstone of research. Especially with all that’s happening right now, user empathy should be our guiding principle. </p><h3 id="put-yourself-in-their-shoes"><a href="#put-yourself-in-their-shoes">Put yourself in their shoes</a></h3><p>It’s possible (likely, even) that many people you’d like to talk to are experiencing their own difficulties, both on a personal and professional level. While some of your users might welcome a change of pace, others may not want to talk. Even if that means temporarily putting a workstream on hold or slowing things down, it’s ok.</p><h3 id="be-prescriptive"><a href="#be-prescriptive">Be prescriptive</a></h3><p>As meetings move to calls or video conferencing, you might find yourself relying on more tools to make things happen. Remember that the people you’re talking to have differing comfort levels with technology, and may not be familiar with the apps you’re using. In her presentation, Irene reminded us not to assume that someone knows how to set up a video call: “Even for a lot of us who work in tech, this can be a challenge.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?rect=0,0,1984,1105&amp;w=670&amp;h=373&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d16db5a2df39f575e99bf6ed58e8ef6f4266fb2-1984x1106.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A slide from Irene Kim’s presentation on remote usability research</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to sending screeners and prep work ahead of time, provide thorough instructions for joining the call and outline what to expect during the session. Some of the directions might seem obvious to you, but the extra thought and guidance will make the process easier for your participants (and they’ll likely feel more comfortable as a result).</p><h2 id="bringing-your-team-along"><a href="#bringing-your-team-along">Bringing your team along</a></h2><p>While our team is used to doing remote user interviews, we’re not accustomed to having our internal teams distributed across cities.  Now that we’re conducting all interviews over VC, we have to be more selective about who’s involved—having too many people on the line can make participants uncomfortable.</p><p>Here are a few tips for keeping your team in the loop, without overwhelming the participant:</p><ul><li><strong>Decide who’s “in the room”</strong>: If you have a facilitator and a note-taker, you’re set. Anyone else who would normally be an “observer” should sit this one out.</li><li><strong>Record the session (with permission)</strong>: Recordings offer context and tone that don’t translate to written notes. Just make sure to ask for participants’ consent ahead of time.</li><li><strong>Host post-session debriefs with the entire team</strong>: Make sure to include everyone in the working group, not just those on the call. Beyond keeping you on the same page, it allows you to recap findings to date and uncover any gaps that you still need to fill.</li></ul><p>One of our researchers at Figma, <a href="https://twitter.com/christa_uxr?lang=en">Christa Simon</a>, has also started recording status updates and uploading them to Slack. In these videos, she reviews who we’ve talked to and who else is on the calendar, what we’re hearing so far from these interviews, and where to find project materials and insights.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/558fc75311e1db133d1810c380eb3ae5031cc5a6-2688x1496.png?rect=0,0,2687,1496&amp;w=670&amp;h=373&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/558fc75311e1db133d1810c380eb3ae5031cc5a6-2688x1496.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/558fc75311e1db133d1810c380eb3ae5031cc5a6-2688x1496.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/558fc75311e1db133d1810c380eb3ae5031cc5a6-2688x1496.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/558fc75311e1db133d1810c380eb3ae5031cc5a6-2688x1496.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/558fc75311e1db133d1810c380eb3ae5031cc5a6-2688x1496.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Christa, a researcher at Figma, shares a status update with the team</figcaption></figure><h3 id="gathering-around-the-virtual-board"><a href="#gathering-around-the-virtual-board">Gathering around the (virtual) board</a></h3><p>Since we can’t huddle in a conference room or chat near our seating area, the team has been creating <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/832014126907207694">virtual boards in Figma</a> to collate and synthesize findings.

NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C. are far from the audiences that Irene and her team want to interview, meaning that in-person sessions can be impractical: “We have listeners all the way from the most rural areas to the most metropolitan cities, so remote testing has been—and will continue to be—a really valuable tool for us to use.”</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="VFKSSDoJ78R4" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>If you’re looking to run remote research, <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/832014126907207694">this template</a> can get you started.

As we build the ecosystem around Figma, it’s important to us that you can always get your data out of our service. Today, we’re excited to share that our friends at <a href="https://www.framer.com/">Framer</a> (who’ve recently joined Figma on the web!) have built a Figma importer. For our shared customers that love using both Figma and Framer, we’re excited for your experience to be more seamless than ever.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="F0Y3Z0QT4TUh" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Our journey towards building an open platform started on day one. Since our founding, we believed that your data should never be locked inside Figma. It’s one of the many reasons we build Figma on the web and provide APIs for other developers to tap into.</p><p>When we <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-platform/">released the first web API in 2018</a>, we noticed that customers like Uber and Github were bringing Figma file data into their internal tooling. One user <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelmcmillan/status/1230795934671548416?s=20">even used Figma as a CMS</a>! And when we <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-plugins/">introduced Figma’s plugin API</a>, we were pleased to see developers use plugins to bring data in and out of Figma.</p><p>In fact, we were so gung-ho about getting data out of Figma that we even tried <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-first-api-challenge/">introducing an API challenge</a> asking for our community’s help to build a Sketch Exporter. Thanks to our community’s feedback, we learned that this <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/we-made-a-mistake-with-our-api-challenge-and-were-sorry/">wasn’t the right approach</a>, and we rolled it back.</p><h3 id="an-open-platform-that-fits-any-design-workflow"><a href="#an-open-platform-that-fits-any-design-workflow">An open platform that fits any design workflow</a></h3><p>At Figma, we care deeply about giving you control of your data, because part of making design more accessible means making design tooling more accessible. We believe that designers should have the freedom to fluidly work across their favorite tools. </p><p>While many designers do use Figma for their entire workflow — brainstorming, wireframing, designing, prototyping, research, handoff and more — we know that some need specialized tools for more advanced functionality. For example, some of our customers prefer Zeplin’s philosophy on developer handoff to Figma’s, and we’ve loved working with the Zeplin team to bring our tools closer together. When you’re building a product, it’s never a good idea to try and be all things to all people, and we rely on our ecosystem partners to help us fill in the gaps.</p><h3 id="prototype-your-figma-files-in-framer-web"><a href="#prototype-your-figma-files-in-framer-web">Prototype your Figma files in Framer Web</a></h3><p>Today, we’re excited to introduce a new integration with Framer Web, where you can now easily import Figma files into Framer Web for more advanced prototyping. </p><p>Prototyping in Framer Web can help you achieve more expressive interactions. For our joint customers who use Framer and Figma, this new integration enables design teams to design collaboratively in Figma and then create prototypes with Framer.</p><p>Here’s a quick peek at how it works:</p><figure></figure><p>Framer Web is currently in beta, but you can grab a spot on the waitlist <a href="https://www.framer.com/web/">here</a>.

      <title>Keeping that tight-knit feeling, at a distance</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/keeping-that-tightknit-feeling-at-a-distance/</link>
      <description>A round-up of tips and activities to keep your team close.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like many of you, we at Figma have been settling into the rhythm of remote work, with Zoom 1:1s, virtual lunches, and livestreamed All Hands. Last week we shared <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-run-a-remote-brainstorm/">tips for running a remote brainstorm</a>, based on our own experience trying to translate offline meetings to an online-only environment. </p><p>But it’s not just about adapting our workflows for a distributed team; since we first made the decision to start working remotely, our top priority has been finding ways to stay connected while far apart. There are so many aspects of working together in an office that don’t feel like work—team offsites, coffee runs, meals—and ultimately make work better, easier, and more fun.</p><p>Below, you’ll find our approach to bringing those offline moments online, and what we do to keep our (currently remote) team feeling like a team.</p><h2 id="keeping-your-team-close"><a href="#keeping-your-team-close">Keeping your team close</a></h2><p>Our office is built to foster a sense of community—the micro-kitchens, lunch area, and open floor plan all allow us to easily connect with teammates. Without those shared spaces, spontaneous run-ins are few and far between. While we can’t sit down for lunch or grab coffee in-person these days, we’ve found ways to recreate those important moments, virtually.</p><h3 id="be-intentional"><a href="#be-intentional">Be intentional</a></h3><p>When things are business as usual, some meetings can easily be redirected to a quick email thread or Slack conversation. It’s tempting to fall into the trap of cancelling non-essential syncs, but now we’re trying to think of them as a good excuse to check in on each other. Meetings can still serve an important purpose, even when there’s no formal objective.</p><h3 id="get-leaders-on-the-same-page"><a href="#get-leaders-on-the-same-page">Get leaders on the same page</a></h3><p>When we first started working remotely a few weeks ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/zoink?s=20">our CEO, Dylan</a>, gathered the managers at Figma to brainstorm ways to keep the team close. Leaders across teams offered their tips, from daily morning check-ins to virtual coffees. We’ve also created a Slack channel where managers continue to share learnings, articles, and any other resources that might come in handy. While the approach to remote work looks a little for different each team (and it should!), there’s a shared understanding that we’re all in it together. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?rect=0,0,1652,934&amp;w=670&amp;h=379&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b843f73225838053c2162fa4d371b1e5e55242a3-1652x935.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A slide that one of our leaders shared with other managers at Figma</figcaption></figure><h3 id="build-in-moments-of-joy"><a href="#build-in-moments-of-joy">Build in moments of joy</a></h3><p>From (optional) team-wide workouts to virtual meetups for dog and cat owners, many of us have been setting aside time to connect with coworkers outside of necessary meetings. We’ve also noticed that making subtle adjustments to routine meetings and communications can make a big difference. </p><p>During presentations, we make good use of the chat feature on Zoom—since it can be awkward to present into the virtual abyss, we use chat to applaud, plus one, and ask questions. At the end of every All Hands, everyone turns on their video for a few seconds so we can see each other’s faces instead of just names and avatars. </p><p>Every other week, we all sit down for “Show and Tell,” during which Figmates share their work, tell a story, or teach the rest of the company something they’re passionate about. It’s hard to capture the magic of these meetings online, so at the most recent Show &amp; Tell, we decided to mix it up. Halfway through the meeting, everyone was encouraged to share their favorite Zoom backgrounds, which included everything from the Northern Lights to Guy Fieri.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2403a71a47b9862ba26f53f591eec960635cb641-1608x936.png?w=670&amp;h=390&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2403a71a47b9862ba26f53f591eec960635cb641-1608x936.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2403a71a47b9862ba26f53f591eec960635cb641-1608x936.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2403a71a47b9862ba26f53f591eec960635cb641-1608x936.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2403a71a47b9862ba26f53f591eec960635cb641-1608x936.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2403a71a47b9862ba26f53f591eec960635cb641-1608x936.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A snapshot of some of our favorite Zoom backgrounds from a recent company-wide meeting</figcaption></figure><p>Our conversations on Slack have become even more upbeat and emoji-filled than usual. Every morning, someone from the team pings in our company-wide channel with a prompt to kick off the day on a positive note. Most recently, we were all invited to share the shows we’re planning to binge-watch over the weekend. </p><p>We’ve long used <a href="https://www.donut.com/">Donut</a>, an app you can add to Slack, and we’re making a point of keeping up that tradition. If you opt in, the app pairs you with 1-2 Figmates at random and starts a thread within Slack so you can find time to connect and get to know one another. When we all worked together in the office, we’d often do walking 1:1s. Now, some team members are using Zoom or FaceTime to go on (socially-distanced) strolls around their respective neighborhoods.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0f76dd6d88de8e11ed27f5f7d6025fdafc99fd8-1600x783.png?rect=0,0,1599,783&amp;w=670&amp;h=328&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0f76dd6d88de8e11ed27f5f7d6025fdafc99fd8-1600x783.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0f76dd6d88de8e11ed27f5f7d6025fdafc99fd8-1600x783.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0f76dd6d88de8e11ed27f5f7d6025fdafc99fd8-1600x783.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0f76dd6d88de8e11ed27f5f7d6025fdafc99fd8-1600x783.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0f76dd6d88de8e11ed27f5f7d6025fdafc99fd8-1600x783.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The Donut app in action</figcaption></figure><h2 id="connect-with-activities-in-figma"><a href="#connect-with-activities-in-figma">Connect with activities in Figma</a></h2><p>As we find what works for us, we’ve been taking inspiration from the community. Many of you are already using Figma to stay connected. Here are some of the games that have been created and replicated by the community:</p><ul><li><strong>Figma Tennis</strong>: Based on Layer Tennis, the idea is to <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/807395611622250536">volley images back and forth</a>, building on each other’s work to end up with something entirely different than when you started.</li><li><strong>Trash Dinosaur</strong>: Work with your team to <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1144347002643341312">build a dinosaur</a> with five virtual pieces of trash.</li><li><strong>Virtual bookshelf</strong>: <a href="https://twitter.com/emplums/status/1242487173275770886">Display your favorite books</a>, or share what you&#39;re currently reading.</li><li><strong>Word-guessing game</strong>: Test each other’s drawing skills with a <a href="https://twitter.com/StefaniaBje/status/1241111942602928135">Pictionary-inspired</a> competition.</li></ul><figure><figcaption>Figma Tennis</figcaption></figure><p>These don’t need to be standalone activities—try kicking off a meeting with a quick game or reserving the last ten minutes for a team-wide exercise. When it seems like the team is far away, remember that sometimes the simplest things can make you feel close.</p><p>For more exercises like this, check out the community round-up of <a href="https://www.notion.so/Remote-Design-Resources-from-the-Community-e2af55fa7ace484bbe66d98ba3fd2020">activities to do with your team</a> and take a look at <a href="https://www.figma.com/remote-design/">our remote design resources</a>.

      <description>Learn how SWD onboards students, organizes files, teaches classes, and provides project feedback with Figma for their online courses.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This guide is brought to you by Students Who Design.</em></p><p><em>Students Who Design (SWD) is an online platform for learning product design. They are currently teaching a free online course called Introduction to Digital Product Design—helping many graduates secure their first design job through their mentorship program, blogs, and podcast. They’ve been teaching their design courses virtually through Figma since their inception.</em></p><p><em>Note: Figma is free for students and educators! <a href="https://www.figma.com/education/">Apply here</a>.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="aHgv76OiAsF1" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Online design classes offer students greater access to education and more flexibility to learn on their terms. As more coursework moves online, educators are faced with the unique challenge of teaching design remotely. </p><p>In this guide, we’ll walk through how we onboard students, organize our files, teach classes, and provide project feedback with Figma for our online course. We’ve also included some examples from our set-up and a list of other tools we’ve found helpful along the way.   </p><p>Let’s dive in:</p><h2 id="_1-pre-class-set-up"><a href="#_1-pre-class-set-up">1. Pre-Class Set-Up</a></h2><h3 id="onboarding-students"><a href="#onboarding-students">Onboarding Students</a></h3><p>Once we have our course roster, it’s time to get all of our students into the same Figma workspace. </p><p><strong>Step 1: Ask students to create a personal Figma account at <a href="https://www.figma.com/">figma.com</a></strong>We ask all of our students to create a personal Figma account before starting the course. We also ask them to play around in the editor to get familiar with the user interface and basic controls so that we can dive right in on the first day. Anyone can get started on Figma for free (with full editor functionality), so all we have to do is ask them to sign up directly with Figma to get started.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Invite students to our Figma account as an editor</strong>Once our students confirm they have an account, we invite them to our SWD <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039964073-Create-a-Team">team</a>. This way, they can view our lectures and start familiarizing themselves with Figma. We also use Loom to record audio over each slide so that students can receive pre-recorded lectures.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/718e3484284d46a42ccb5c5238888231516994d6-1600x994.png?rect=0,0,1600,993&amp;w=670&amp;h=416&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/718e3484284d46a42ccb5c5238888231516994d6-1600x994.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/718e3484284d46a42ccb5c5238888231516994d6-1600x994.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/718e3484284d46a42ccb5c5238888231516994d6-1600x994.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/718e3484284d46a42ccb5c5238888231516994d6-1600x994.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/718e3484284d46a42ccb5c5238888231516994d6-1600x994.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="structuring-files"><a href="#structuring-files">Structuring Files</a></h3><p>We implemented a structured file and naming system so that we could support as many students as possible while keeping our workspace organized.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Organize instructor coursework</strong>Since we keep our coursework in the same account as student files, our team uses <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038006374-Projects-in-Figma">projects</a> and naming conventions to organize our lectures, sponsorship initiatives, and brand assets. Using projects allows us to continuously improve our curriculum and initiatives in one space while giving current students feedback and guidance in another. </p><p><strong>Step 4: Ask students to create a file according to our naming conventions</strong>Every student in our course follows a standard naming convention for their Master Figma file (we use: Intro DPD: Name). Following a naming convention allows us to search student work quickly and have everything related to the course in one place. </p><h2 id="_2-teaching-in-figma"><a href="#_2-teaching-in-figma">2. Teaching in Figma</a></h2><p>We decided to orient our course around a hands-on exercise to improve Messenger. Students can watch the pre-recorded lectures and take notes at their own pace. Assignments, however, have a specific weekly deadline after which an instructor provides feedback. The 3-week course starts with research and design principles, then goes into a class-wide brainstorm for prioritizing feature improvements, and concludes with each student completing their own high-fidelity user flow. </p><p><em>Note: We know there are so many different ways that educators can teach design. This section will probably be the most helpful for educators offering a similar flavor of coursework; if that’s not your course, you may want to skip to the next section.</em></p><p><strong>Step 5: Share a UI Kit and Template to get things started</strong>In order to keep everyone&#39;s work organized and to reduce the initial inertia of &#39;creating from scratch&#39;, every student starts by duplicating a master Figma file. <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/825053000056030974">Here&#39;s the master file</a> we use for our course.

This also makes it easy for educators to hop into a file to check in on student progress. We suggest that pages include:</p><ul><li>A number to make scanning simple</li><li>A title describing the fidelity of design or what to expect in the page</li><li>A page devoted to exploration, inspiration, and revision</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/02ec92aad4a467512e0a2b4b5553ce5e47af8fd2-1600x913.png?rect=0,0,1600,912&amp;w=670&amp;h=382&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/02ec92aad4a467512e0a2b4b5553ce5e47af8fd2-1600x913.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/02ec92aad4a467512e0a2b4b5553ce5e47af8fd2-1600x913.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/02ec92aad4a467512e0a2b4b5553ce5e47af8fd2-1600x913.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/02ec92aad4a467512e0a2b4b5553ce5e47af8fd2-1600x913.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/02ec92aad4a467512e0a2b4b5553ce5e47af8fd2-1600x913.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>In the example of our third assignment, students take what they&#39;ve been conceptualizing and designing in the first two assignments and make a <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040314193-Getting-Started-with-Prototyping">Figma prototype</a>.

      <title>How to run a remote brainstorm</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-run-a-remote-brainstorm/</link>
      <description>The Figma team shares tips for running a remote brainstorm, based on what’s working well for us.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a lot happening in the world right now, and we have to acknowledge that things aren’t business as usual. While the main goal certainly isn’t maximum productivity, the reality is that many of us—ourselves included!—are still doing work, attempting to find a rhythm in our new (temporary) normal. So, we at Figma have been exploring ways to make that adjustment a little easier.</p><p>We’ve all been working from home for the past few weeks now, and we’ve been thinking a lot about how to translate the moments that happen in the office to an entirely-remote workforce. It has long been a habit of ours to add a dial-in for our remote colleagues, but we’re not used to a fully-dispersed team. Now that it’s no longer an option to have a quick huddle or whiteboard in a conference room, we’re realizing how challenging it is to run an effective brainstorm (and how frustrating it can sometimes be for our always-remote colleagues). </p><h2 id="brainstorming-at-figma"><a href="#brainstorming-at-figma">Brainstorming at Figma</a></h2><p>We’re lucky that we have a very open, collaborative culture here at Figma. Many of us seek out feedback from our coworkers on all sorts of topics, whether it’s exploring different product directions or fielding ideas for new blog posts. Brainstorms can mean a lot of things. Broadly, we turn to them when we need to hear from different perspectives, riff on concepts with a wider audience, or build out an idea into something more substantial.</p><p>Compared to more transactional meetings focused on updates and check-ins, brainstorms require different energy. While they’re not always about creative concepts, they often ask participants to dream up original ideas. That can be tough to do, especially during such an uncertain time. Below, we’re sharing what we’ve learned as we try to keep our brainstorms structured and efficient, while giving our team the space to think creatively.</p><h2 id="getting-ready"><a href="#getting-ready">Getting ready</a></h2><p>Like any other brainstorm, a little prep work will help you get the most out of your time together. Just remember that you might need to pay more attention to the logistical details—when the whole team is remote, it’s particularly important to make sure everyone’s on the same page.</p><h3 id="outline-goals"><a href="#outline-goals">Outline goals</a></h3><p>Ask yourself what you’d like to get out of the brainstorm, keeping in mind the phase your project is in. Are you looking to get as many new ideas as possible, or do you need help refining a couple different options? Being clear about your goal will help your teammates understand what level of concepts you need.</p><h3 id="get-your-tools-ready-to-go"><a href="#get-your-tools-ready-to-go">Get your tools ready to go</a></h3><p>In the office, you can find people at their desks or quickly bounce ideas around in a conference room. As we get used to working from home, we’re realizing how much more we’re relying on our tool ecosystem. Here’s a quick checklist:</p><ul><li><strong>Video conferencing</strong>: Include a link to a VC call in the meeting invite. While everyone can technically dial in by phone or hide their video, encourage the group to turn on their cameras. Getting a little face time can make everyone feel more connected and open to throwing out new ideas. Plus, <a href="https://twitter.com/joeyabanks/status/1237791152926941184">we’ve been having a lot of fun</a> with <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/210707503-Virtual-Background">Zoom&#39;s Virtual Background</a> feature, which allows you to choose an image or video as your background.</li><li><strong>Figma file</strong>: In Figma, you can create one central home for everyone to work off of (while <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/821550158119537264">this one</a> is technically for a full design sprint, it’s a great place to start). Make a file (like <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/826616537405470521">this one</a>) specifically for the brainstorming session and give everyone in the meeting edit access. You can make as many pages as you need within that file. Or, you can create multiple frames to house ideas that fall into different themes.</li><li><strong>Chat</strong>: If it’s an ongoing workstream, consider creating a Slack channel. Beyond sending meeting notes and keeping the team up to date, you can ask the team for ad hoc feedback and input. Pro tip: paste the link to the working doc in the channel’s “topic” field so everyone can easily find it.</li></ul><h3 id="send-the-file-in-advance"><a href="#send-the-file-in-advance">Send the file in advance</a></h3><p>Some people work better when they have time to reflect on the task, instead of doing it live. Send the file the night before or morning-of with a brief description of what you’re hoping to accomplish. If you have ideas for the team to react to or build on, make sure to flesh those out in the doc. Encourage teammates to ping you directly or comment in the file with questions.</p><h2 id="running-a-remote-brainstorm"><a href="#running-a-remote-brainstorm">Running a remote brainstorm</a></h2><h3 id="kick-things-off"><a href="#kick-things-off">Kick things off</a></h3><p>By this point, you’ve already shared goals and initial thinking with the team. As a quick refresher, or for anyone who hasn’t gotten around to reviewing your materials, remind the group what you’re looking for and how they can help. During the session, it’s possible—likely, in fact—that the group will veer off course at some point. It’s usually a good sign that they’re excited about what you’re talking about! To get things back on track, create a “Parking lot” within your document and direct everyone to write down ideas there that aren’t directly relevant to the conversation, but are worth exploring at a later date.</p><h3 id="run-an-exercise"><a href="#run-an-exercise">Run an exercise</a></h3><p>Freeform sessions certainly work, but we’ve found that more structured brainstorms are better when everyone’s remote. If you’re running the session over VC, consider having participants break out into teams of 2-3. Some people are more inclined to chime in when they’re not in a big group, and it’s easier to handle potential technical or communication issues in a smaller forum. Here’s what that looks like in practice, based on a brainstorm our Product Marketing team ran last week:</p><ul><li>Join the Zoom and share your screen with the Figma file (or ask the team to <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040322673-Follow-Along-with-Observation-Mode">follow along in Observation mode</a>).</li><li>Have everyone opt into small groups of 2-3 (some VC tools like Zoom have a <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206476313-Managing-Breakout-Rooms">&#34;breakout&#34; feature</a>).</li><li>Ask each group to designate a “lead” who will share takeaways with the broader group.</li><li>If you’re just trying to get as many ideas as possible, ask everyone to create a <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/778045990962853168">post-it note</a> for each unique idea. If you’re looking to riff on existing concepts, instruct them to comment directly on the file.</li><li>Set a 10-min timer. Remind everyone to re-join the group when they’re ready.</li><li>Call on each group to present, and make sure to take notes on the central file.

      <title>Extend what’s possible with plugins for you and your team</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/extend-whats-possible-with-plugins-for-you-and-your-team/</link>
      <description>Get inspired by plugin creators from Uber, GitHub, and Atlassian—see what&#39;s possible and start creating your own plugins.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’ve already started integrating plugins into your workflow, then you’ve probably discovered the productivity gains of being able to reduce lengthy operations to a few clicks. However, there isn’t always a plugin to come to the rescue. Maybe your challenge is too specific to your product or the nuances of your components and styles. So what do you do? Build your own bespoke tools to help you and your team work faster!</p><p>Over the last six months it has been encouraging to see the growth of the plugin community. In addition to the 400+ plugins that are now publicly available, many people have also shared private plugins that are specifically tailored to their own individual and team’s workflows. At <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/reflections-on-config-our-first-user-conference/">Config</a>, one of our most popular sessions—and one that we certainly underestimated the demand for—centered around this exact topic. In this series of lightning talks, <a href="https://twitter.com/lily___digital">Lily Nguyen</a> (Uber), <a href="https://twitter.com/brian_lovin">Brian Lovin</a> (GitHub), and <a href="https://twitter.com/pwnies">Jake Millar</a> (Atlassian) shared a collection of tools they created, along with guidance on how to identify the right opportunities for building your own.</p><h2 id="automating-the-boring-parts-a-mono-plugin-for"><a href="#automating-the-boring-parts-a-mono-plugin-for">Automating the boring parts—a mono plugin for GitHub</a></h2><p>Brian Lovin, Staff Product Designer at GitHub, started building plugins after realizing how cumbersome repetitive tasks could be. As he encountered these tasks, each eventually became the impetus to build a small utility to make those boring jobs easier (and faster!). </p><figure></figure><h3 id="borders-utility"><a href="#borders-utility">Borders utility</a></h3><p>The first plugin was a small utility that shows and hides a particular combination of layers in Github’s list item components. Instead of having separate components that would each need to be maintained, each list item component could make use of many divider sizes and placements. This meant that Brian could consolidate all of the divider options into a single group within the component. He then built a plugin to toggle the visibility of the correct divider.</p><h3 id="color-theming"><a href="#color-theming">Color theming</a></h3><p>For their <a href="https://github.com/mobile">upcoming mobile app</a> the team planned to support light and dark themes, in addition to a high contrast mode (available in both themes) for accessibility. This meant creating and managing four sets of different (but sometimes visually hard to distinguish) colors and repetitively applying each of those functionally named colors with their counterparts in corresponding themes. Brian built a plugin to quickly search and manage the growing list of styles, making it easier for designers to find the right colors. Additionally, the plugin also made it possible to quickly switch entire designs from one theme to another with a couple of clicks.</p><h3 id="real-content-and-a-consolidated-approach"><a href="#real-content-and-a-consolidated-approach">Real content and a consolidated approach</a></h3><p>Continuing down this path, adding real content was next. In order to create accurate mockups (and stress test designs), a data population plugin was made to pull live real data from their API directly into designs. The plugin pulls in random samples of data and maps corresponding content, like avatars, usernames, and full names, to layer names in their components. </p><p>After building each of these tools, Brian consolidated their functions into a single “mono plugin.” This enabled a more seamless user experience for other designers on the team to install and launch a single plugin UI to access all of these workflow enhancements.</p><h2 id="real-content-and-real-avatars-at-atlassian"><a href="#real-content-and-real-avatars-at-atlassian">Real content, and  real avatars at Atlassian</a></h2><p>Fueled by the fear of unknowingly shipping filler text and imagery to production, Jake Miller, Design Systems Lead at Atlassian, set out to tackle building a content generator for their designers. While there were a few existing plugins for populating designs with more generic text, the design teams at Atlassian needed content specific to their products and data that was linked together (i.e. a project description that would correspond to a project name). The end result: a plugin called ADG Data Generator that enables designers to choose content from whichever product they’re working on. Working on a Jira feature? Projects and ticket numbers! BitBucket? Branches and commit messages! </p><p>The plugin can fill in data for users as well, with one twist: instead of using stock imagery—which potentially means shipping a photo of an actual person—the plugin leverages AI-generated images of realistic looking users who aren’t <em>actually</em> real.</p><figure></figure><p>Looking to build something similar? Jake and the team have been kind enough to <a href="https://proto.atlassian.design/figma">share the source code of their generator</a> plugin with the community.</p><h2 id="_3d-vehicles-linting-crits-and-more-at-uber"><a href="#_3d-vehicles-linting-crits-and-more-at-uber">3d vehicles, linting, crits and more at Uber</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0d6c9a54af74d577e64a0f940d021724d2e7d17-1598x678.png?rect=0,0,1598,677&amp;w=670&amp;h=284&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0d6c9a54af74d577e64a0f940d021724d2e7d17-1598x678.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0d6c9a54af74d577e64a0f940d021724d2e7d17-1598x678.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0d6c9a54af74d577e64a0f940d021724d2e7d17-1598x678.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0d6c9a54af74d577e64a0f940d021724d2e7d17-1598x678.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0d6c9a54af74d577e64a0f940d021724d2e7d17-1598x678.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Lily, in collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/bettergui">Vietanh Nguyen</a>, has been working closely to improve collaboration, reduce inconsistencies and accelerate workflows at Uber. The duo has produced over four plugins to help their team in different ways:</p><h3 id="design-crits-for-mobile"><a href="#design-crits-for-mobile">Design crits for mobile</a></h3><p>Part of successfully evaluating a mobile design is interacting with it on a device. The team already had a very open and collaborative critique process, but sharing to a large screen made it difficult for each member to get a sense of how the design would feel in the palm of their hands. To make this process easier, they built a plugin that uses a QR code with a URL to mirror whatever frame is selected in Figma, directly to each persons device. Everyone in the crit can now independently experience each design, enabling them to provide more thoughtful feedback.</p><h3 id="color-linter"><a href="#color-linter">Color linter</a></h3><p>Linting is a tool used by developers to help automate the discovery of programming bugs, syntax errors, and stylistic inconsistencies. Lily and Vietanh decided to bring this concept to Uber’s designers by building a plugin that would find incorrectly applied color styles, and objects without them. The plugin flags them and assists users in picking the right semantically-named colors from their palette. The end result not only helps them reduce errors when developers are inspecting files, but also allows designers to use Uber’s custom light/dark mode plugin to instantly preview any design in the opposite theme with a single command.</p><h3 id="uber-garage-improving-mock-up-quality-with-3d"><a href="#uber-garage-improving-mock-up-quality-with-3d">Uber Garage: Improving mock-up quality with 3d vehicles</a></h3><p>Due to the wide range of vehicles you can request at Uber, designers had to mockup designs for everything from passenger cars, to scooters, to helicopters. With all these considerations, there’s a limitless combination of perspectives and angles required to accurately situate these vehicles on a map. To solve this, the team built a plugin called Uber Garage which allows a designer to choose a vehicle, rotate a 3-dimensional model to their desired angle and instantly insert it into their design.</p><h2 id="watch"><a href="#watch">Watch</a></h2><p>Want to watch the full session?

      <title>Finding confidence in design decisions</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/finding-confidence-in-design-decisions/</link>
      <description>We have all doubted ourselves and our decisions at some point in our careers. This activity will help guide you through your confidence-building journey.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At some point in their career, most professionals will face what I like to call, “The Confidence Conundrum”; how do I propose a solution with an “I got this!” attitude while managing my internal feeling of “do I got this?”? </p><p>This can be particularly challenging for designers who are taking action based on a complex combination of experience, data, project motivations, personal motivations, taste, and instinct... and convincing stakeholders who each have their own experience, data, project motivations, personal motivations, tastes, and instincts.</p><p>While we can’t control everything about the design process, we can control the narrative in our own heads. Here are some activities that can help you build more confidence and show up with the “I got this” attitude and believe it.</p><p><em>Note: I recommend doing them in a small group with your peers. Learning about other people’s experiences is almost always eye-opening and strangely validating. Let’s get started. Keep an open mind and jump right in.</em></p><h2 id="the-early-scary-things"><a href="#the-early-scary-things">The Early Scary Things</a></h2><p>Exploring early life experiences around building confidence can help us re-frame our personal narratives from a broader, more generous, perspective. I’ve found this engenders a warmer attitude towards the work we need to do on ourselves, and makes us more likely to actually do it. Doing this exercise with others also creates an environment of empathy where everyone can better understand and support each other in their confidence-building.</p><h3 id="activity-time"><a href="#activity-time">✨Activity Time✨</a></h3><p>Think of a time in your life when you were not yet confident in yourself in regards to a particular skill, activity, or discipline. What steps did you take to achieve confidence?</p><ul><li>Write a few examples down on your own (2-5 min)</li><li>Talk with your group about your fear and how you built confidence (5 min)</li></ul><p><strong>Here are some examples from our workshop:</strong>  </p><ul><li>My experience: When I was a kid, my biggest fear was that I wouldn’t be able to read out loud without stuttering. I had zero confidence, despite the hours I would spend practicing to myself in my room.  So whenever I had the chance, I would have my parents and grandparents read with me, asking them to correct my mistakes along the way. I needed their help a lot at first, but eventually, I could read on my own with no mistakes — I was even placed in an advanced reading group!</li><li><em>“As a child, I lacked confidence in swimming and I overcame it by telling my mom. She helped by signing me up for swim classes and she gave me swim goggles. From there, I couldn’t avoid participating when I was in class since I was almost the oldest of the kids :) I still lack the confidence but know how to better manage it.”</em></li></ul><h2 id="building-confidence-with-data-and-experience"><a href="#building-confidence-with-data-and-experience">Building Confidence with Data and Experience</a></h2><p>Two of the best ways to build confidence are: <strong>A. Gathering more data</strong> or <strong>B. Building more experience</strong>. Chances are you’ll have to do both, a lot, over and over again, to achieve full confidence.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f1369a68755c46c5234078f58a57aa16173729-1600x755.png?w=670&amp;h=316&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f1369a68755c46c5234078f58a57aa16173729-1600x755.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f1369a68755c46c5234078f58a57aa16173729-1600x755.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f1369a68755c46c5234078f58a57aa16173729-1600x755.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f1369a68755c46c5234078f58a57aa16173729-1600x755.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f1369a68755c46c5234078f58a57aa16173729-1600x755.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><strong>Data</strong>The designer’s job is to solve complex problems, and to make their solutions look easy-peasy — like there was never even a problem to begin with. If you aren’t feeling very confident in your design decisions, perhaps you don’t have enough information to really get to work. You can build your confidence up with data, validation, and advice. Talking to peers, people who have solved similar problems, or people who are experiencing the problem first hand will enable you to come to more meaningful conclusions. This is my favorite part of the design process — filling my brain to the absolute brim with every single variable I can find that’s related to the problem. Even when we’re sleeping or “not working,” our brains get to work putting the pieces together, making our solutions more and more obvious as we work through it. </p><p><strong>Experience</strong>Here’s the thing nobody wants to hear; sometimes, building confidence just takes time. Our first exercise on childhood fear is a great example of this. Constant practice was the only thing that made me the star reader I am today. We build our experience from doing the thing that is scary over and over again until suddenly it isn’t scary anymore; and that’s confidence.</p><p>The journey of building experience, however, is not a straight path. It is a winding and twisting road that spirals around itself multiple times like a spirograph. Designers are often handed the same kinds of problems to solve over and over again throughout their careers. Each time we’re handed one of these problems, we are able to leverage the experience from the past and apply it with nuanced meaning. And with each experience, we create real emotional connections to the outcomes of our past decisions. This emotional connection to our successes and failures is the strongest connection we have to our own feelings of confidence.</p><h3 id="activity-time"><a href="#activity-time">✨Activity Time✨</a></h3><ul><li>Write about an area in your life where you would like to build more confidence today. This could be a hobby, a design project, or any area of your life where you wish you had more confidence. (5 min)</li><li>Share your current scary thing from exercise 2 with your group. What do you think you could use more of in your current confidence conundrum? Data, or courage to step into the experience? Maybe it’s a little of both :)</li></ul><p><strong>Here are some examples that came out of the workshop:</strong>  </p><ol><li>My experience: Right now I’m lacking confidence in giving unwanted feedback to my direct reports. It just terrifies me! But I know that I’m not doing them any favors by keeping feedback to myself. This is definitely an experience problem. It’s going to take a lot of courage, but I’m just going to have to keep practicing this and trust that it will get more and more natural over time.</li><li>“I’m currently struggling with confidence in my design craft and decisions. I overcome the former by reading articles, studying how other products are executed and asking for feedback from the product team/design friends. I overcome the latter with research and talking to stakeholders.”</li></ol><p>I hope this helped you on your confidence-building journey. If you try it out with your team or a group of friends or colleagues, I’d love to hear about it.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a lot of talk about culture, and for good reason. Beyond boosting team happiness, a great culture can foster a sense of belonging, make a company an attractive place to work, and help employees deliver successfully on business goals. Whether intentionally or not, culture impacts everything from employee engagement, to how fast your product ships, to how well your company maintains a healthy bottom line.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e40a060dbef5dea61c4954afc0d87929ef5313f4-1600x1067.jpg?rect=0,0,1599,1067&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e40a060dbef5dea61c4954afc0d87929ef5313f4-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e40a060dbef5dea61c4954afc0d87929ef5313f4-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e40a060dbef5dea61c4954afc0d87929ef5313f4-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e40a060dbef5dea61c4954afc0d87929ef5313f4-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e40a060dbef5dea61c4954afc0d87929ef5313f4-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Running a &#34;Designing Culture&#34; workshop at Config, Figma&#39;s first user conference.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="culture-explained"><a href="#culture-explained">Culture, explained</a></h2><p>As a design program manager, I’ve built a career shaping processes and culture, and I’ve learned that these factors can make or break a team’s ability to innovate and ship great work. The challenge is that culture often feels intangible, and it’s tough to influence if you don’t know where to start.</p><p>Culture is also inevitable—whether it’s an afterthought or you actively tend to it, you’ll end up with an environment that reflects the individuals on your team. While some companies prefer to let culture unfold organically, I’ve found that creative teams are more successful when they’re intentional about building it. </p><p>I like to frame <em>culture</em> as how you act on your beliefs. This can, of course, take shape at the company-wide level, but organizations, teams, and even working groups can have their own cultures as well. These subcultures, when developed successfully, will ladder back to the environment that the company establishes.</p><p>At Dropbox, we’ve explored what <a href="https://dropbox.design/topic/creative-culture">creative culture</a> is and what it means in the context of our work. In the past year, we’ve translated research findings into a collection of tools called <a href="https://dropbox.design/browse/resources">Culture Kits</a>. These activity sets are designed to help unpack the messy, abstract nature of culture and give teams the tools they need to shape it for themselves.</p><h2 id="a-step-by-step-guide-to-building-culture"><a href="#a-step-by-step-guide-to-building-culture">A step-by-step guide to building culture</a></h2><p>At Config, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/reflections-on-conf/">Figma’s first user conference</a>, I ran a group of attendees through the <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/768174747850641472">Team Values Toolkit</a>. This is a set of exercises that can be used for designing new culture or building upon what already exists on a team. Much like other design processes and frameworks, you can use this kit to set goals, develop, and iterate.</p><p>Here’s a snapshot of the activities you’ll find in the toolkit: </p><p><strong>Define individual beliefs.</strong> If culture means acting on your beliefs, it’s important to be explicit about what those beliefs are. Have everyone on your team share stories about their work experiences to uncover values they feel strongly about. Giving everyone an opportunity to say what’s important to them will ensure that team culture is representative of all voices and doesn’t just reinforce dominant thinking patterns. It’s the first step in building from a place of inclusion, not from a top-down directive.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ec8111772e1b531e7f46da8ed9a11158335efa83-1600x1067.jpg?rect=0,0,1599,1067&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ec8111772e1b531e7f46da8ed9a11158335efa83-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ec8111772e1b531e7f46da8ed9a11158335efa83-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ec8111772e1b531e7f46da8ed9a11158335efa83-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ec8111772e1b531e7f46da8ed9a11158335efa83-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ec8111772e1b531e7f46da8ed9a11158335efa83-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A team completes step 1 of the toolkit, defining individual beliefs</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Agree on shared values.</strong> While people will likely use different words, themes will begin to emerge. For example, if “teamwork,” “partnership,” and “clear goals” come up as key values, you might group them into “collaboration.” Ask your team to identify consistent threads and discuss how those values will serve the team (and potentially ladder up to the company’s values).</p><p><strong>Identify supporting behaviors.</strong> Values are important, but they don’t mean much unless you can put them into practice. With this in mind, discuss situations and behaviors that will make your values a real part of your practice. Talk about how you’ll embody your values to navigate tension, make decisions, and work together. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6be37d40ce1665b371cb88a5fee07a13590744ab-1600x1067.jpg?rect=0,0,1599,1067&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6be37d40ce1665b371cb88a5fee07a13590744ab-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6be37d40ce1665b371cb88a5fee07a13590744ab-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6be37d40ce1665b371cb88a5fee07a13590744ab-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6be37d40ce1665b371cb88a5fee07a13590744ab-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6be37d40ce1665b371cb88a5fee07a13590744ab-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><strong>Establish habits.</strong> Consider what will reinforce those behaviors and decide on what you’ll do to make it happen. If we take the collaboration example, start by identifying the communication styles, norms, and processes that would make it easier to work cross-functionally or to get feedback from other team members. The value-behavior-reinforcement loop establishes a social contract for your team and those around it. The way you act on your beliefs becomes what is felt and understood by the team. If you can be intentional about how this takes shape, you’ll have influence over your culture and be able to design one that is healthy, meaningful, and productive.  </p><p><strong>Evaluate and iterate.</strong> It can take time for teams to get into a rhythm, so be patient. Make sure you’re keeping what works and letting go of what doesn’t. As with a product, you should consider how you’ll measure success for your culture to ensure it serves your team and the work that it does. If you have a quarterly offsite, commit to revisiting the framework each time you meet.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0744ff7fd8f2a502e38ad03fb9fa919233f8314-1600x1067.jpg?rect=0,0,1599,1067&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0744ff7fd8f2a502e38ad03fb9fa919233f8314-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0744ff7fd8f2a502e38ad03fb9fa919233f8314-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0744ff7fd8f2a502e38ad03fb9fa919233f8314-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0744ff7fd8f2a502e38ad03fb9fa919233f8314-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0744ff7fd8f2a502e38ad03fb9fa919233f8314-1600x1067.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="culture-in-practice"><a href="#culture-in-practice">Culture in practice</a></h2><p>Culture will ultimately impact everything you do as a team, whether it’s brainstorming new content, building new features, or delivering feedback to one another.

      <title>Reflections on Config, our first user conference</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/reflections-on-config-our-first-user-conference/</link>
      <description>When we first set out to organize a user conference, our goal was to create a space to have meaningful conversations. Here is a look at some key themes that emerged from those conversations.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this month, we held our first user conference, Config. As our user base has grown, we’ve been looking for more opportunities to connect in person. While we’ve met many of you at events around the world, this was the first time that over 1,000 of us came together to learn, share, and explore in one place. Whether you joined in person or online, we were impressed with the way you all showed up to workshop, chat, learn, and laugh with us—thank you. (And if you couldn&#39;t make it, don&#39;t worry, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXDU_eVOJTx4UHprj9iYPBu4agz8HiB66">watch all of the recorded sessions here</a>).</p><p>When we first set out to organize a user conference, our goal was to create a physical manifestation of the community, a space to have meaningful conversations on topics like team culture, mentorship, and design ethics. Another must-have was making sure that every Figma employee had a chance to hear from our users, and that our users got to meet each other.</p><p>More than anything, it was a conference by and for the community. Instead of building out a set agenda, we leaned on you all to bring Config to life. <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/lets-create-figmas-first-user-conference-together/">When we announced Config</a>, we made a call for ideas; many of the workshops, lightning talks, and roundtable discussions were the product of your submissions. We wanted you all to take an active role, and you did—it wasn’t just about listening to talks and presentations, but participating in and contributing to a collective discussion.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c71226e6bc13270c8e888ba981db3200f1126680-1800x1200.jpg?rect=1,0,1799,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c71226e6bc13270c8e888ba981db3200f1126680-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c71226e6bc13270c8e888ba981db3200f1126680-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c71226e6bc13270c8e888ba981db3200f1126680-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c71226e6bc13270c8e888ba981db3200f1126680-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c71226e6bc13270c8e888ba981db3200f1126680-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>That discussion centered on open design. Developing “openly” has long been a theme in engineering, but it’s relatively new to design. This concept of sharing, remixing, and building on each other’s work showed up in a number of sessions: Devon Zuegel taught us how <a href="https://youtu.be/80KTVu6GGSE">open source extends beyond the digital world</a> to urban planning and physical infrastructure; Jason Kunesh recalled how students became an extension of the City of Chicago’s design team and <a href="https://youtu.be/Js_1DeCb6JI">built a design system</a> when his team was under-resourced; Miguel Solorio shared how Microsoft <a href="https://youtu.be/yZUZk9B-PlE">brought the community into the design process</a>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c089d1b55085c250498ded9e82178264ffdd906b-1800x1200.jpg?rect=1,0,1799,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c089d1b55085c250498ded9e82178264ffdd906b-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c089d1b55085c250498ded9e82178264ffdd906b-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c089d1b55085c250498ded9e82178264ffdd906b-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c089d1b55085c250498ded9e82178264ffdd906b-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c089d1b55085c250498ded9e82178264ffdd906b-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Devon Zuegel on the keynote stage at Config</figcaption></figure><p>We were encouraged to think more broadly about community as well. Craig Mod reminded us that <a href="https://youtu.be/WrAxvpvfB2w">technology makes it all too easy to isolate ourselves</a>: “Smart phones are teleportation devices, which is great if you’re somewhere you don’t want to be.” It’s up to us to use technology not to escape, but to connect more deeply with those around us. Finally, May-Li Khoe shared how she <a href="https://youtu.be/Aalyplbv5Mo">joyfully subverts the status quo</a> while supporting the communities she cares about and encouraged us to think about what we can do for our own.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/540cf4243c0af1d4fbf82c501f77e74b27af067a-1800x1200.jpg?rect=1,0,1799,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/540cf4243c0af1d4fbf82c501f77e74b27af067a-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/540cf4243c0af1d4fbf82c501f77e74b27af067a-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/540cf4243c0af1d4fbf82c501f77e74b27af067a-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/540cf4243c0af1d4fbf82c501f77e74b27af067a-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/540cf4243c0af1d4fbf82c501f77e74b27af067a-1800x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>May-Li Khoe closing out Config</figcaption></figure><p>Thank you to everyone who came out, and to the team at Figma who made Config happen.

We’re kicking off with over 1000 Figma users at our very first conference, Config, in San Francisco. And this month, we’re announcing 7 new features to help designers create faster, enable product teams to collaborate as one unit, and give the entire design community more ways to share openly.</p><p>If you weren’t able to join us live at Config, you can watch (or re-watch) our product announcement below or read on for a summary of what’s new to Figma.</p><h2 id="where-we-ll-focus-in-2020-creation-collaboration"><a href="#where-we-ll-focus-in-2020-creation-collaboration">Where we’ll focus in 2020: creation, collaboration, community</a></h2><p>This year we’re focused on evolving the Figma product in three key areas:</p><ul><li><strong>Creation:</strong> Build innovative features that automate repetitive design work</li><li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Be inclusive of everyone that’s part of the design process</li><li><strong>Community:</strong> Enable the design community to share and learn from one another</li></ul><p>And of course, none of this matters without a reliable, high-performing platform, so that’ll forever be a foundational investment.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/41b88f8d51a7421cebe1ca8a69a3e88086930f1b-3840x2160.png?rect=1,0,3839,2160&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/41b88f8d51a7421cebe1ca8a69a3e88086930f1b-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/41b88f8d51a7421cebe1ca8a69a3e88086930f1b-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/41b88f8d51a7421cebe1ca8a69a3e88086930f1b-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/41b88f8d51a7421cebe1ca8a69a3e88086930f1b-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/41b88f8d51a7421cebe1ca8a69a3e88086930f1b-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>To remove unnecessary steps, clicks, and pixel-pushes, we’re introducing new features to speed up how you work with type, color, and spacing in Figma. </p><p>🆕 Since releasing our first version of Auto Layout just a couple months ago, we’ve been hard at work making it even more powerful. Driven by user feedback, <strong>Auto Layout</strong> can now be used to make responsive components which stretch to fill their containers, in addition to buttons which resize with their text and lists which can be easily rearranged. This is especially helpful when creating designs across multiple device types.</p><figure></figure><p>🔜 Figma comes with 1000+ pre-installed fonts; plus you can upload any custom fonts to use and share. While lots of options are great, scrolling through an endless list of fonts is not. The redesigned <strong>Font Picker</strong> now surfaces the fonts you use most—your organization’s shared fonts and your favorites—and allows you to quickly search through the rest. It also highlights all the fonts used in your file so you can ensure consistency across your designs.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ced19d8128a2d8bff98cf226cd434babde835552-3840x2160.png?rect=1,0,3839,2160&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ced19d8128a2d8bff98cf226cd434babde835552-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ced19d8128a2d8bff98cf226cd434babde835552-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ced19d8128a2d8bff98cf226cd434babde835552-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ced19d8128a2d8bff98cf226cd434babde835552-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ced19d8128a2d8bff98cf226cd434babde835552-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>🆕 Sometimes, you need to change the color of fills, strokes, and text independently. Other times, you just want them to be the same color. <strong>Selection Colors</strong> enables you to batch update colors across fills, strokes, and text in a click. </p><figure></figure><p>🔜 Prototyping plays a critical role in helping you iterate on your designs faster, allowing you to test your designs and collect quick and relevant feedback. To help you create higher fidelity prototypes, we’re adding prototype interactions for new devices such as keyboards, gamepads, and accessibility controllers. With these new triggers, you can prototype your application&#39;s keyboard shortcuts, like <code>Cmd</code> + <code>F</code>, or even video game menus with gamepad directional buttons.</p><h2 id="new-ways-to-collaborate-as-one-product-team"><a href="#new-ways-to-collaborate-as-one-product-team">New ways to collaborate as one product team</a></h2><p>While shipping innovative features that boost creative productivity will always be at our core, we know that great products aren’t built alone. Working well as one product unit is critical to shipping products your customers will love. But sharing, communicating, and getting the right feedback is hard because context is so easily lost between teams, tools, and time zones. </p><p>🔜 To never lose context, you can now <strong>hyperlink</strong> any text to any page on the Web, any page within a file, or any frame in the Editor. For example, you may want to link to external resources, like a product requirements doc, or link to specific pages or frames to create a clickable table of contents that helps collaborators navigate your file.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/595f494bfcc7379399ca07570627072b4a8fc9ba-3840x2160.png?rect=1,0,3839,2160&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/595f494bfcc7379399ca07570627072b4a8fc9ba-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/595f494bfcc7379399ca07570627072b4a8fc9ba-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/595f494bfcc7379399ca07570627072b4a8fc9ba-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/595f494bfcc7379399ca07570627072b4a8fc9ba-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/595f494bfcc7379399ca07570627072b4a8fc9ba-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>🆕 To help connect the various tools you use throughout the design process, we’re introducing the new <strong>Plugin Inspector API</strong>. Developers can now update plugins to surface key information in the properties panel. Seeing a plugin like Notepad in the properties panel can highlight key action items. Or knowing that a plugin like Mapsicle was used to generate a map visual allows for easier updating. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f842c1954ef37a5cd613d7b79cc333b3367b5d2e-3840x2160.png?rect=1,0,3839,2160&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f842c1954ef37a5cd613d7b79cc333b3367b5d2e-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f842c1954ef37a5cd613d7b79cc333b3367b5d2e-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f842c1954ef37a5cd613d7b79cc333b3367b5d2e-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f842c1954ef37a5cd613d7b79cc333b3367b5d2e-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f842c1954ef37a5cd613d7b79cc333b3367b5d2e-3840x2160.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>🔜 Sharing your design work is key to communicating your ideas and getting buy-in, so we’ll continue to advance sharing capabilities. We’ve added a new sharing permission that lets you share a prototype without sharing the underlying design file, coming soon to the Figma Professional and Organization plans.</p><figure></figure><p>Lastly, we don’t want collaboration to be limited to just your team or organization. We want to enable you to share with and learn from the entire design community.</p><p>That’s why we <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-community/">introduced the beta of the Figma Community last October</a>—to build a public space where our users can publish live design files that anyone in the world can inspect, remix, and learn from. Over the last few months, we’ve seen over 400 creators publishing over 1000+ files, like wireframe templates, icon sets, design system examples, device frames, slide templates, illustrations, and more.</p><p>Across the files published, we’ve seen useful UI resources, like <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/778763161265841481/">Google’s Material Design UI Kit</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/786632241522687494/">Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code Toolkit</a>, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/805195278314519508/">Uber’s Base Gallery</a>. But we’ve also been surprised by some incredibly creative files, like <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/769707486811574398/">Gleb’s Pac Man</a> game and  <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/773439497184575668/">アンドリュー’s DIY Magic: the Gathering Cards</a>. We’ve also seen files that improve designer’s day-to-day workflow, like <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/769740081575343235/">Ben Fryc’s Design Handoff Checklist</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/796065181822060173/">Ben Radcliffe’s Sticky Notes</a>.</p><p>If you haven’t joined the beta, <a href="https://forms.gle/ViwJn45F9JDWEuAY8">sign up here</a> to publish files to your public profile and discover, duplicate, and remix any one of the 800 files now available in the Figma Community.</p><h2 id="when-you-can-get-your-hands-on-the-new-things"><a href="#when-you-can-get-your-hands-on-the-new-things">When you can get your hands on the new things</a></h2><p>The new Auto Layout updates, Selection Colors, and Plugin Inspector API are available starting today. The new Font Picker, Hyperlinks, and the full roll-out of the Figma Community will be coming soon. We have so much more in store for this year. Stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Test designs early and often with the new Maze integration</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-the-new-maze-figma-integration/</link>
      <description>Now user testing is easier and faster with Figma and Maze’s new product integration.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now user testing is easier and faster with Figma and Maze’s new product integration. </p><p>For those not yet familiar, <a href="https://maze.design/?utm_source=figma&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=integration-launch&amp;utm_content=blog-article">Maze</a> provides design and research teams with UX insights from real users. What makes Maze unique is the ability to quantitatively measure your user’s experience across multiple flows. Whether you’re looking to do 1:1 interviews or test at scale with 50,000 users, Maze gives teams at companies like Ring, Revolut, and IBM the ability to invest more in user research without the overhead. </p><p>Rather than waiting to A/B test in a development environment, the Figma and Maze integration enables testing earlier in the process. With a simple copy and paste of a Figma prototype link, you can import your design into Maze: </p><figure></figure><p>For Figma users who are interested in using the integration, Maze is offering 30% off <a href="https://maze.design/pricing/?utm_source=figma&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=integration-launch&amp;utm_content=blog-article">any paid plan</a> for 3 months. Just use this promo code to sign up: <code>MAZE_LOVES_FIGMA</code>.</p><p>Regardless of whether or not you rely on a user testing tool or have dedicated research folks, we believe that everyone should feel empowered to learn directly from customers. Here are a few research best practices to help you get started: </p><h2 id="_1-have-a-target-goal-in-mind-before-you-test"><a href="#_1-have-a-target-goal-in-mind-before-you-test">1. Have a target goal in mind before you test</a></h2><p>Before you even build a prototype, you’ll want to first define what success looks like. Good test goals are specific, quantifiable metrics. Every test is different and therefore may have different goals and targets. But here’s an example: In order to call the test successful, 80% of test subjects need to complete the task(s) successfully and less than 2% can misclick.</p><h2 id="_2-test-your-test"><a href="#_2-test-your-test">2. Test your test</a></h2><p>For new features, product teams often run a beta program or do a gradual roll-out. The same best practice applies to user tests, especially if you’re testing with a large population of users. Running a pilot before you start testing with real users ensures that the test works as intended and provides the opportunity to fix any issues that might arise.<br/>To run a pilot, you can share your test with your internal teammates, or even friends and family members. Run them through the test as if it’s the real thing to make sure the tasks are clear, the prototype works properly, and the goals are meaningful. </p><h2 id="_3-test-with-your-existing-users-and-non-users-too"><a href="#_3-test-with-your-existing-users-and-non-users-too">3. Test with your existing users—and non-users too</a></h2><p>When running usability tests, some of your best subjects are your existing users. They already know your product and most likely can’t wait to be the first to try out a new feature. They can be your biggest advocates and provide invaluable feedback. To find engaged test subjects, focus on customer segments that would most likely adopt the new feature. <br/>Testing with existing customers can provide great insights from seasoned users, but you don’t want to bias your research. Don’t forget to also test with non-users to get a fresh pair of eyes. </p><h2 id="_4-avoid-leading-questions-and-tasks"><a href="#_4-avoid-leading-questions-and-tasks">4. Avoid leading questions and tasks</a></h2><p>One essential rule for creating usability tasks is to avoid using leading words that guide users toward the answer. Examples of leading words are “click here,” “go to,” or “navigate to,” If you tell a test subject, &#34;Click the Signup button to create an account and go to the Feed page to upload images,&#34; you’re essentially telling them what to do, instead of testing if the user experience is intuitive. A well-phrase task is focused on the end-goal you want the user to achieve and avoids any internal feature lingo. </p><h2 id="_5-throw-an-analysis-party"><a href="#_5-throw-an-analysis-party">5. Throw an analysis party</a></h2><p>When summarizing your user testing results, one of the most challenging aspects of this part of the research phase isn’t necessarily extracting relevant insights, but rather getting buy-in on those findings and agreeing on next steps across your organization. <br/>Similar to the benefits of collaborating on design projects, collaborating on the analysis of test results allows the entire product team to discuss their interpretations of the findings and the best actions to take. Maze makes it easy to get everyone involved with reports you can pull instantly and a custom URL you can use to share the data with anyone.</p><p>To dive deeper into the integration details, check out the <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041246514">getting started doc</a>. And if you have any feedback on the integration, I’d love to hear from you at <a href="https://twitter.com/mazedesignHQ">@mazedesignHQ</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Post-mortem: Service disruption on January 21-22, 2020</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/post-mortem-service-disruption-on-january-21-22-2020/</link>
      <description>The root cause of our recent service outage and our next steps</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As much as we love to build and ship new features, the performance and reliability of our platform is always our top priority. We take downtime seriously. We know that if Figma is unavailable, your work is disrupted, and we wanted to detail the service incidents that occurred on Tuesday, January 21, 2020 and Wednesday, January 22, 2020.</p><p>As reported on our <a href="https://status.figma.com/">status page</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/zoink/status/1220153686074122241?s=20">Twitter</a>, a number of our users experienced intermittent issues or were unable to load Figma between the hours of 6 and 7 AM PST on January 21st, and at multiple points during the day on January 22nd.</p><p>These incidents do not live up to your expectations or our standards, and we apologize for the disruption they caused. In this post, we’ll dive into our analysis of the issue, share technical details that illustrate why we’re confident in our diagnosis, and discuss next steps we’re taking to prevent future incidents.</p><h2 id="timeline-what-happened"><a href="#timeline-what-happened">Timeline: What happened?</a></h2><p><strong>January 21, 2020</strong></p><ul><li>[6:11 AM PST] Our engineering team receives automated alerts about elevated error rates.</li><li>[6:54 AM PST] We discover a long-running, expensive query that has been causing elevated database CPU. After cancelling this query, performance returns to normal.</li></ul><p><strong>January 22, 2020</strong></p><ul><li>[9:45 AM PST] Database metrics show an increase in write IOPS and lock contention. However, in contrast to the previous day, database CPU is lower than normal.</li><li>[10:00 AM PST] Our engineering team receives an automated alert and begins to investigate.</li><li>[11:42 AM PST] Database load causes enough API requests to queue up that the service becomes unavailable for some users. To mitigate the database load, we cancel several inessential queries and increase allocated IOPS. Performance temporarily stabilizes.</li><li>[2:00 PM PST] Database performance deteriorates and the site again becomes unavailable.</li><li>[3:00 PM PST] We restart the database to apply settings to temporarily disable a background process which we believe was contributing to the write load. Performance stabilizes.</li><li>[7:00 PM PST] We take the service down for emergency maintenance and upgrade the database to a version we had already tested in our staging environment.</li><li>[8:15 PM PST] We complete the upgrade and bring the site back online. All site and database metrics return to normal.</li></ul><h2 id="tl-dr-why-did-it-happen"><a href="#tl-dr-why-did-it-happen">TL;DR: Why did it happen?</a></h2><p>Tuesday’s incident was primarily caused by a long-running, expensive query. To prevent this issue from recurring, we will be improving our monitoring of expensive queries and setting tighter bounds on allowed running time.</p><p>The root cause of Wednesday’s incident was that a routine change in database statistics caused PostgreSQL 9 to mis-plan the execution of one of our queries, causing expensive table scans and writes to temporary buffers. This was exacerbated by concurrent aggressive autovacuuming operations, which were happening because of a vacuuming backlog from the long-running query that had been terminated on Tuesday.</p><p>The upgrade to PostgreSQL 11 mitigated both of these causes: improvements to the query planner eliminated the possibility of the bad query plan, and the performance characteristics of autovacuuming have been significantly improved between versions 9 and 11.</p><p>For a detailed technical explanation of our investigation, conclusions, and next steps, read on…</p><h2 id="root-cause-analysis-what-caused-the-database"><a href="#root-cause-analysis-what-caused-the-database">Root cause analysis: What caused the database performance problems?</a></h2><p>In the early stages of the incident, our leading theory was that the performance problems were primarily due to automatic vacuuming. Vacuuming is a routine process that helps maintain database health. Normally it runs automatically and with minimal impact on other database tasks, but in this case, the long-running query that had been cancelled on Tuesday produced a backlog of data to be vacuumed. This crossed the threshold for a more aggressive form of automatic vacuuming intended to prevent transaction ID wraparound. This autovacuum mode has a greater impact on locking and writes, especially in the version of PostgreSQL that we were running.</p><p>During the incident, we canceled autovacuum statements running on our largest tables and saw database metrics improve temporarily. However, the stability was short-lived. Eventually autovacuuming would resume, as would write IOPS and lock contention. Fully preventing aggressive autovacuuming required changing the <code>autovacuum_freeze_max_age</code> database parameter and rebooting, which we eventually did. (This reboot was responsible for a portion of the downtime between 2 PM-3 PM.) While this brought relative stability to the site, write IOPS, write latency, and lock contention were still higher than normal.</p><p>The next mitigation we discussed was upgrading the version of PostgreSQL we were using. We had two reasons to consider an upgrade:</p><ul><li>PostgreSQL 9.6 and later include <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/storage-vm.html">an important optimization related to autovacuuming</a>.</li><li>With PostgreSQL 10 and later, Amazon RDS (the managed PostgreSQL service we use) offers more sophisticated performance analysis tools that will help us diagnose issues such as this.</li></ul><p>We had previously upgraded our staging database to PostgreSQL 11, tested it for several months without issues, and written a detailed plan for performing the upgrade in production. Therefore we felt confident about performing the upgrade even under less than ideal conditions. Given the risk of ongoing instability, we determined that it was best to do the upgrade in the evening rather than waiting until the weekend. Our preparation paid off: the upgrade was successful, and with site stability returned to normal, we could focus fully on diagnosing the root causes.</p><p>Because we continued to see performance issues even after disabling autovacuums, we concluded that while they may have been a contributing factor, they were not the only culprit. We turned our attention to a second factor: an unexpectedly expensive query. During the incident, we had observed that one particular statement with complex subqueries showed up repeatedly as being involved in lock contention. We restored a database snapshot from immediately prior to the database upgrade and examined the query plan for the problematic statement. Several facts about the plan stood out:</p><ul><li>The plan was much more expensive than expected. In particular, it estimated that it would return over 20 million rows, when in fact the actual result was only 3 rows. This likely meant that either the query planner was operating on bad statistics about the contents of the tables involved in the query, or that we had encountered a bug or deficiency in the query planner.</li><li>The expensive plan performed full table scans where we expected it to use an index, and wrote a large amount of data to temporary buffers, consistent with high write IOPS and temp bytes metrics we observed during the incident.</li><li>On the upgraded database, the plan for the same query predicted row counts accurately, used the expected indexes, and did not write to temporary buffers. This gave us some confidence that the stability we saw post-upgrade was not just a fluke and upgrading had been the right call.</li></ul><p>The query was a complex one, generated by our ORM layer. (It’s admittedly more complex than it needs to be, and one of our followup tasks will be to review and optimize this and similarly complex queries.) We removed parts of the query that proved non-essential to replicating the issue, reducing it to a query on the <code>roles</code> table with nested sub-selects:</p><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>&#34;roles&#34;</span><span>.</span><span>&#34;id&#34;</span><span> 
</span><span>2</span><span></span><span>FROM</span><span> </span><span>&#34;roles&#34;</span><span> 
</span><span>3</span><span></span><span>WHERE</span><span> id </span><span>IN</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>
</span><span>4</span><span>  </span><span>SELECT</span><span> </span><span>&#34;roles&#34;</span><span>.</span><span>&#34;id&#34;</span><span> 
</span><span>5</span><span>  </span><span>FROM</span><span> </span><span>&#34;roles&#34;</span><span> 
</span><span>6</span><span>  </span><span>WHERE</span><span> roles</span><span>.</span><span>id </span><span>IN</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>?</span><span>)</span><span>
</span><span>7</span><span></span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div><p>With this reduced query, we could quickly investigate hypothesis about the query planner behavior. We restored a database snapshot from several days prior to the incident and observed that the plan for this query on that date had a reasonable estimate (199) for the number of rows:</p><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>Nested Loop  (cost=17055.00..18144.32 rows=199 width=8) (actual time=0.076..0.090 rows=3 loops=1)
</span><span>2</span>   -&gt;  HashAggregate  (cost=17054.43..17056.42 rows=199 width=8) (actual time=0.068..0.068 rows=3 loops=1)
<span>3</span>         [...]
<span>4</span>   -&gt;  Index Only Scan using roles_pkey on roles  (cost=0.56..5.45 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.005..0.006 rows=1 loops=3)
<span>5</span>         Index Cond: (id = roles_1.id)
</code></pre></div><p>The fact that the same query had wildly different row estimates at two different times suggested an issue with statistics. Statistics are a form of database metadata the query planner uses to estimate the relative costs of potential query plans. They are updated by the <code>ANALYZE</code> command, which, like <code>VACUUM</code>, is typically run as an automated background process. Looking at data from <code>pg_stat_user_tables</code>, we observed that one of the tables involved in the query had completed an automatic <code>ANALYZE</code>  command at exactly the same time as the incident began. And indeed, after we manually ran <code>ANALYZE</code> on this table on our test database, the query plan went from estimating 199 rows returned to estimating over 20 million:</p><div><pre><code><span>1</span><span>Nested Loop  (cost=16161.53..17255.46 rows=20682690 width=8) (actual time=0.098..0.115 rows=3 loops=1)
</span><span>2</span>   -&gt;  HashAggregate  (cost=16160.96..16162.96 rows=200 width=8) (actual time=0.081..0.081 rows=3 loops=1)
<span>3</span>         [...]
<span>4</span>   -&gt;  Index Only Scan using roles_pkey on roles  (cost=0.56..5.44 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.007..0.007 rows=1 loops=3)
<span>5</span>         Index Cond: (id = roles_1.id)
</code></pre></div><p>In the original, unreduced query, this bad row estimate had a cascading effect, triggering expensive table scans and writes to temporary buffers. Execution times stretched into multiple minutes.</p><p>We now had strong evidence that a change in table statistics had caused the query planner to switch from a good plan to one with catastrophically bad performance. We began to research query planner behavior, and a key turning point in our investigation was the discovery of <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/CAL9smLC_ZfUO1YxEWMoiuxhEA_VriRhk5U1BQj7wXJdWLYXWKA%40mail.gmail.com">this post from the PostgreSQL mailing list</a>. The symptoms closely matched our own: an inner HashAggregate query crossing a threshold of 200 estimated rows, causing the total estimated number of rows to jump wildly.</p><p>Based on the discussion on the mailing list thread, the “deficiency in the query planner” hypothesis now seemed much more likely, and was bolstered by the fact that we were able to replicate a test case in the mailing list post on our test database, but not the upgraded database. Something had evidently been fixed between PostgreSQL 9.5 and 11, but we weren’t sure what. Using the official PostgreSQL Docker images, we bisected PostgreSQL versions. The test case replicated in 9.6.16, but not in 10.0. Reviewing the release notes for 10.0, the following change caught our eye: “Use uniqueness guarantees to optimize certain join types (David Rowley)”. Because the join in our query involved the primary key, we believed the uniqueness guarantee applied to our case. We located <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/9c7f5229ad68d7e0e4dd149e3f80257893e404d4">the relevant commit</a>, and from it learned that the output of <code>EXPLAIN VERBOSE</code> would include the text “Inner Unique: true” when this optimization was in use. We confirmed that on the upgraded database, the plan did include this indicator.</p><p>A final question we asked was why the query planner’s row estimate had crossed this critical threshold of 200 at all when the actual row count was only 3. By examining several PostgreSQL snapshots over time, we discovered that PostgreSQL had increasingly underestimated the selectivity of the innermost subquery. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/50DF5920.1090109%40synedra.com">As this article explains</a>, this can happen because <code>ANALYZE</code> uses a statistical sample of rows, which may underestimate the number of unique values of a column if the same values for that column tend to be clustered together.</p><p>At this point, we felt confident we had located the root cause: a routine change in database statistics triggered a deficiency in the PostgreSQL 9 query planner’s row estimates, causing catastrophically expensive table scans and writes to temporary buffers. This was exacerbated by concurrent aggressive autovacuuming, which was triggered due to a vacuuming backlog from a long running query that had been terminated the previous day.</p><p>We’re also confident this issue will not recur. The upgrade to PostgreSQL 11 mitigated both of these causes: the query planner is able to take advantage of the uniqueness of the inner relation to avoid the problematic query plan, and the performance characteristics of autovacuuming have been significantly improved.</p><h2 id="next-steps"><a href="#next-steps">Next steps</a></h2><p>We learned a lot from these incidents and are already working on a number of follow up actions to improve our resilience to future incidents. These include:</p><ul><li>Revisiting transaction timeouts and limits so that long running and expensive queries are terminated.</li><li>Improving metrics, monitoring, and database settings related to autovacuuming, locking, and query performance.</li><li>Auditing our queries for unnecessary or excessive joins and subqueries that could trip up the query planner.</li><li>Integrating the new performance tools available in the upgraded version of PostgreSQL into our incident response plans; this will help us isolate problematic queries faster if a future event occurs.</li><li>Auditing the structure and access patterns of various types of data currently stored in PostgreSQL. We may benefit from moving certain types of data into datastores tailored to their access patterns.</li><li>Improving our in app messaging around unexpected maintenance windows.</li><li>Moving towards online database upgrades that don’t require future downtime.</li></ul><p>In addition to these infrastructure improvements, we’re also revisiting our product priorities and front-loading some project work that was planned for later. To start, we’re kicking off an initiative to ensure you can continue to work on your already open files safely after going offline even if you close your browser before coming back online.</p><p>We’ll be sharing more details soon about this upcoming product work. In the meantime, if you have any questions about the service disruption, please don’t hesitate to get in touch at <a href="mailto:support@figma.com">support@figma.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma on Figma: How we built our website design system</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-on-figma-how-we-built-figma-dot-coms-design-system/</link>
      <description>A look at how the Figma marketing team built, and continues to build, the design system for figma.com</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note: This post was originally published on <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/">designsystems.com</a>. It has been updated and republished here.</em> </p><p>At Figma, we think design systems are a powerful tool to help democratize and empower entire organizations to be a part of the design process. They enable consistency at scale and help teams deliver better products, faster. But what product design teams have been learning and adopting in terms of design systems has not been as quick to catch on when it comes to marketing and web design. </p><p>As the newly joined marketing web producer, I began to dissect the pages on our marketing site as well as the process for creating new pages. I realized that we severely lacked the consistency and rigor that we believe to be a best practice for web design. Instead of a repeatable method for building pages and a library with reusable elements, designers and developers were coming up with their own systems and creating brand new solutions, many of which were very similar, though not exact, to solutions already implemented on other pages. Not only was the marketing site difficult to maintain and update, it felt inconsistent for our users. It was time to build a system.</p><h2 id="taking-inventory"><a href="#taking-inventory">Taking inventory</a></h2><p>Our first step was to take stock of what we had – fonts, sizes, colors, column widths, layouts, and so on. We started compiling all of that information into a Figma file, and from there, it was easy to see overlaps, or in other words, repeated applications of patterns that just needed to be unified. We also spotted the outliers, or those components that had been used only once, and therefore didn’t have a place in our style guide. </p><p>Some of the repeated elements were quite large, so we dissected them down to an atomic level, which would allow anyone using the design system to then piece the atoms and molecules together to form organisms that fit the needs of any page and the content that needed to live there. It was very important for us to end up with flexible building blocks that could work in conjunction with one another in any combination.</p><p>We also looked for elements that were similar, but not exactly the same, and agreed on one style. So, instead of 12 different sizes for headings, we established an H1-H3, body copy, and technical copy styles. We did the same for our blog and other long form content, adding styles such as pull quotes and block quotes. </p><p>Once we interpreted and refined the visual language we’d already created, it was a pretty simple exercise to organize all the components in a shared library so that a person with little design experience or familiarity with Figma’s brand could create something that looked and felt cohesive with the rest of our site. </p><h2 id="a-simplified-flexible-design-system"><a href="#a-simplified-flexible-design-system">A simplified, flexible design system</a></h2><p>Over the course of a month, our small team created and organized a robust, adaptable style guide and component library that now lives in our CMS, Contentful. Everything is consistent across the board—typography, sizes, padding, line heights, colors, and grid. Now, when the design team goes to create a new page, they’ve got flexible building blocks right at their fingertips. Building an H1 is as easy as grabbing it from the design system. We’ve also begun to “componentize” commonly paired elements and fully assembled sections using the elements from our system. We call these larger organisms “FLEGOs” (Figma + LEGO) and you can check them out in this <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/799433873230303935/">public file</a>.</p><h2 id="getting-to-market-faster"><a href="#getting-to-market-faster">Getting to market faster</a></h2><p>The majority of Figma’s core marketing site is now built with this framework. Using our design system through Contentful, we can go from concept to ship in one day and can do that without the need for any new code. For example, when we wanted to create a <a href="https://www.figma.com/whats-new/">What&#39;s New page</a>, the product marketer who originally had the idea and I made a quick wireframe using the FLEGOs, collaborated on the copy directly in the Figma file, and then built out the page using the components in our CMS. We went from idea to a live web page in less than 48 hours.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?rect=0,0,1173,1332&amp;w=670&amp;h=761&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e97f9fa2a333d10e8396df71900dd75fc71dd1db-1173x1333.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1173w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A portion of the What&#39;s New page that was built using FLEGOs</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, when we want to make a universal change to an atom or molecule, we can do it once in Contentful, rather than getting a developer to hunt through every page to make dozens of updates directly. Recently, we <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/bringing-new-life-to-figmas-brand/">refreshed our brand</a> and updated our brand typeface to Whyte. Because we had all of the site’s building blocks laid out in one file, we were able to quickly make typography updates, see the impact of our decisions, and iterate until we had a type system that worked across the site.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de0600aa4f240a52bbd4276c4496da99d4019020-1520x1523.png?rect=0,0,1520,1522&amp;w=670&amp;h=671&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de0600aa4f240a52bbd4276c4496da99d4019020-1520x1523.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de0600aa4f240a52bbd4276c4496da99d4019020-1520x1523.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de0600aa4f240a52bbd4276c4496da99d4019020-1520x1523.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de0600aa4f240a52bbd4276c4496da99d4019020-1520x1523.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de0600aa4f240a52bbd4276c4496da99d4019020-1520x1523.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Top: A commonly used FLEGO using the the new typeface, Whyte.

We have work to do regarding accessibility and that is something we are prioritizing.</p><p>There are also times when we break out of the system. For example, we wanted to capture a visitor’s attention right away on our homepage, so we opted for larger, centered headline that is animated. There are no other sections like this on our site and therefore this is not part of our design system.</p><figure></figure><p>Whenever we find ourselves straying outside of the system we’re careful to justify why, and also to investigate the likelihood of that same decision being made in the future. If there’s a good chance we might use it again, it’s a compelling reason to add it to the system. </p><h2 id="start-your-own-system"><a href="#start-your-own-system">Start your own system</a></h2><p>Trying to organize and advance your own system?

      <description>There is a lot we are excited about as we look to the year ahead. At the core of it all is the community.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Figma started with an idea by a student and his teaching assistant that design should live on the Web. Fast forward to 2020, we’re entering a new decade with a team of 150 employees and a user base that spans almost every country in the world.

      <title>Measuring the value of design systems</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/measuring-the-value-of-design-systems/</link>
      <description>The data science team at Figma set out to find out just how much time (and money) could be saved when teams leverage a design system.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a Data Scientist at Figma, I dig into customer data everyday to help our team make informed product decisions. Figma’s cloud-based platform gives us a unique advantage to rapidly learn through data and share those insights back to our customers. For example, we recently <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-design-system-analytics/">opened up the data around design system usage</a> to our customers on the Figma Organization plan.</p><p>We wanted to make design system analytics accessible to our customers for two key reasons: </p><ol><li>Design systems are critical to helping teams unite around a single source of truth for assets that are used repeatedly within a product (in fact, 3/4ths of Figma’s enterprise customers are currently leveraging design systems across their entire org).</li><li>Design systems are difficult to build and maintain without quantitative insight into how they are actually being used by designers.</li></ol><p>We believe that with the right data, design systems teams are able to make better decisions about their shared libraries and components, resulting in more useful and relevant design systems. </p><p>As we worked towards releasing this feature, I found myself asking if there was a way to quantify the benefit of maintaining up-to-date and relevant design systems. We knew Design System Analytics would help customers work towards this end state, but was there something more we could measure about the value they’d be gaining? As someone who’s background involves designing experiments, I was excited by the prospect of doing some analysis working with our own design team to understand the impact of design systems. </p><p>I built the following experiment to quantify the amount of time a relevant design system can save designers.</p><h2 id="our-hypothesis-a-well-maintained-design-system"><a href="#our-hypothesis-a-well-maintained-design-system">Our hypothesis: A well-maintained design system means time savings for your designers</a></h2><p>Each time a designer leverages an asset from a design system, they save themselves time by avoiding the following tasks:</p><ul><li>Recreating something from scratch</li><li>Searching through old design files to look for an asset they know exists</li><li>Making micro-decisions around text style, placement, etc.</li></ul><p>The time saved from avoiding these tasks can add up to a huge benefit for designers, allowing them to have more focus time on strategically impactful work.</p><h2 id="the-experiment-how-we-quantitatively-measured-a"><a href="#the-experiment-how-we-quantitatively-measured-a">The experiment: How we quantitatively measured a creative process</a></h2><p>I created a scenario where designers were asked to design a screen that allows users to accomplish two different tasks within the context of a bank account aggregator app. Both tasks were tested to make sure they take an individual the same amount of time to complete, so while one person may complete both tasks in 8 minutes and another may complete both in 12, each designer acts as their own control.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4d3adae63bcd656d178d05b11477ea86f92cb875-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4d3adae63bcd656d178d05b11477ea86f92cb875-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4d3adae63bcd656d178d05b11477ea86f92cb875-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4d3adae63bcd656d178d05b11477ea86f92cb875-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4d3adae63bcd656d178d05b11477ea86f92cb875-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4d3adae63bcd656d178d05b11477ea86f92cb875-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The sample homescreen designers were provided for this experiment.</figcaption></figure><p>The tasks were to 1) design a screen for viewing financial transactions and trends for a specific account, and 2) design a user flow for connecting a new account to your profile. All designers completed both tasks but were only given access to a design system for one of the two tasks. For the task without a design system we provided old design files that each designer could reference for the task - something we often hear designers doing.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed9770735a2e6194cdf0ff93b02afd7f0c3e1fa6-7070x2002.png?rect=5,0,7060,2002&amp;w=670&amp;h=190&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed9770735a2e6194cdf0ff93b02afd7f0c3e1fa6-7070x2002.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed9770735a2e6194cdf0ff93b02afd7f0c3e1fa6-7070x2002.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed9770735a2e6194cdf0ff93b02afd7f0c3e1fa6-7070x2002.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed9770735a2e6194cdf0ff93b02afd7f0c3e1fa6-7070x2002.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed9770735a2e6194cdf0ff93b02afd7f0c3e1fa6-7070x2002.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The design system used in this experiment. </figcaption></figure><p>To eliminate any potential bias, we alternated which task designers were asked to complete first and gave them plenty of time to familiarize themselves with the assets before beginning each exercise. The prompts for each scenario were written to describe tasks the user should be able to do and did not prescribe what the designer should be creating.</p><p>We measured the time it took to complete each task and participants decided for themselves what was an appropriate stopping point to control for quality across both tasks.</p><h2 id="the-result"><a href="#the-result">The Result</a></h2><p>We found that when participants had access to a design system they completed their objective <strong>34% faster</strong> than without a design system.  </p><p>It’s important to call out that the design system used in this experiment was directly applicable to the task the designers were given; it was up-to-date and relevant to what they were working on. As a result, we expect that this time-savings finding is the maximum time savings one would find in a real-world scenario. </p><p>I wanted to take this time-savings result one step further to make it more tangible for a real design team, like the one here at Figma. Figma has 7 Product Designers and based on their calendars they each get about 20 hours of focused design time per week, for a total of 140 design hours per week. </p><p>This means that if <strong>none of the tasks they’re working on</strong> have a relevant design system, they are able to do 140 hours of design work a week. </p><p>However, if <strong>every task they’re working on</strong> has a relevant design system, they are able to do 34% more design work in that 140 hours, giving them 212 design hours. That’s equivalent to adding another 3.5 designers to the team each week!<br/>In reality, Figma’s design team is probably somewhere in between, as they are using a design system that is relevant for some tasks and not others. As we evolve our design system to cover more use cases, and work to ensure all designers on the team are using it consistently, we can expect this to increase. </p><h2 id="investing-in-your-design-systems"><a href="#investing-in-your-design-systems">Investing in your design systems</a></h2><p>While the value of design systems is generally accepted, our goal with this experiment was to take a quantitative approach to make that value more tangible. In addition to the time savings, this experiment also revealed a more qualitative benefit. Several participants commented that they felt more confident in their final design when they had access to the design system because they knew it was consistent with the product. </p><p>With the confirmation that design systems truly are worth the investment, it becomes more critical that design systems teams have the resources they need to make the best decisions when building and evolving their design systems. Figma’s unique insight into design system usage informs these decisions, enabling teams to build more relevant and up-to-date design systems that will have a meaningful impact on their designers’ efficiency.

      <title>Made in Figma, 2019: Design by the numbers</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/made-in-figma-2019/</link>
      <description>A look at what Figma users made, and how they made it, in 2019.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year was a big year for design, for you, and for us. More people, in more places, are participating in the design process and new features like <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-design-system-analytics/">design system analytics</a> open the door to quantifying the value of design work.</p><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-rise-of-ux-ui-design-a-decade-in-reflection/">Design is evolving</a> as an industry and a craft and as 2019 came to a close, we got curious about the state of the taste and tendencies of those designing in Figma. What fonts, styles, and pantones are most popular? What frame sizes are most common? What does it look like, on the file level, for teams to design together? So, we dug into anonymized product data (methodology <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/made-in-figma-2019/#a-note-on-methodology">detailed below</a>) to see what we could learn. Some of the results were expected and some were surprising, but all of them got us even more excited about the future of design. </p><p>Here’s what 2019 looked like in Figma:</p><h2 id="file-style-your-favorite-colors-and-fonts"><a href="#file-style-your-favorite-colors-and-fonts">File style: Your favorite colors and fonts</a></h2><p>Figma provides a space for all phases of design, from free-form explorations to complete prototypes. Fonts, styles, and colors play a critical role in creating something that fully expresses a product and brand. </p><h3 id="keeping-it-cool"><a href="#keeping-it-cool">Keeping it cool</a></h3><p>Beyond greyscale colors (top five depicted below), Figma customers kept it cool this year with lots of greens and blues. The most commonly-used non-greyscale color was #009688 with two dark blues, #455A64 and #263238, next in line. These colors are leaps away from the 2019 Pantone color of the year, Living Coral (<a href="https://www.pantone.com/color-intelligence/color-of-the-year/color-of-the-year-2019">#FF6F61</a>).</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/72e5bf7b3d0e8afe24114bee826d43f095085429-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/72e5bf7b3d0e8afe24114bee826d43f095085429-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/72e5bf7b3d0e8afe24114bee826d43f095085429-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/72e5bf7b3d0e8afe24114bee826d43f095085429-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/72e5bf7b3d0e8afe24114bee826d43f095085429-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="google-fonts-reign-supreme"><a href="#google-fonts-reign-supreme">Google Fonts reign supreme</a></h3><p>In Figma, you can choose from over 900 pre-installed fonts or add a custom font. Unsurprisingly, the top three fonts in 2019 were Montserrat, Open Sans, and Lato which are all Google fonts. Because they’re so readily available in Figma, Google fonts represent six out of the top 10 most-used fonts. Despite not coming out-of-the-box, SF Pro Text, SF Pro Display, and Proxima Nova also made the top 10. </p><p>While we weren’t surprised to see both Apple UI fonts as top contenders, we were surprised to learn Arial surpassed Helvetica in the systems font race!</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/df692d5652ea807b04d0718788210f1d647ceee0-1000x1072.png?w=670&amp;h=718&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/df692d5652ea807b04d0718788210f1d647ceee0-1000x1072.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/df692d5652ea807b04d0718788210f1d647ceee0-1000x1072.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/df692d5652ea807b04d0718788210f1d647ceee0-1000x1072.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/df692d5652ea807b04d0718788210f1d647ceee0-1000x1072.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Note: we excluded Roboto, Figma’s default font, from this list.</figcaption></figure><p>90% of all font usage was concentrated in the top 11 (top 10 above + Roboto, the default).

      <title>&#34;The Decade of Design”: How the last 10 years transformed design’s role in tech</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/the-rise-of-ux-ui-design-a-decade-in-reflection/</link>
      <description>The tech industry, which long exalted the engineer, has finally begun to appreciate the designer too.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The 2010s are coming to a close, and as different blogs recap all the highlights, we’re reminded of <em>just how much changed</em> in such a short period. As little as a decade ago, we didn’t live our lives glued to a smartphone. In 2010, Uber and Instagram were just getting started. </p><p>As mobile upended the way products were built, designers were called to action. Their expertise made them particularly well-suited to the challenge of distilling complex technical systems to essential interactions. Companies that had previously ran on as little design resources as possible <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/31/here-are-some-reasons-behind-techs-design-shortage/">began hiring in spades</a>. (In one memorable run, the IBMs of the world acquired over <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-6-design-trends-john-maeda-predicted-in-his-state-of-the-union/">35 design agencies</a> in two years.) </p><p>Silicon Valley, which had long exalted the engineer, finally began to appreciate the power of the designer too. We didn’t want to let this decade pass without acknowledging the milestones and moments that made this happen. It turns out that a lot can unfold in 10 years, so to help us parse out the most important stuff, we spoke with 12 people across the industry, from design leaders to educators to investors. (To narrow scope, we focused on the U.S. but it’s worth noting these trends played out across the world.)</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5263171d3be7675544b17612b7bafb549c306805-2000x2132.png?rect=0,0,2000,2131&amp;w=670&amp;h=714&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5263171d3be7675544b17612b7bafb549c306805-2000x2132.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5263171d3be7675544b17612b7bafb549c306805-2000x2132.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5263171d3be7675544b17612b7bafb549c306805-2000x2132.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5263171d3be7675544b17612b7bafb549c306805-2000x2132.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5263171d3be7675544b17612b7bafb549c306805-2000x2132.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="the-mobile-wave"><a href="#the-mobile-wave">The mobile wave</a></h2><p>The tipping point that transformed design’s role in tech was — what else? — the iPhone. Although Apple technically introduced it last decade (2007), it didn’t <a href="https://marco.org/2009/06/20/the-economics-of-in-app-purchase">enable in-app purchases</a> until 2009 or launch the iPad until 2010. So its biggest effects were felt in the last 10 years, as mobile spread throughout the world, reshaping consumer preferences and the design that powers them. </p><p>People we spoke with named many different ways the iPhone (and resulting smartphone trend) changed UX/UI design. Here’s a few common themes.</p><h3 id="everything-got-a-little-more-complicated"><a href="#everything-got-a-little-more-complicated">Everything got a little more complicated</a></h3><p>Mobile made everything more complicated. The screens were smaller than on desktop, and more varied in terms of size.  They weren’t just clicking buttons with a mouse — they were using their fingers to swipe, tap, and hold, often while in motion. They might be walking, driving, standing in line at the airport, gondoliering, you get the idea.</p><p>“Mobile normalized the idea of computing beyond the screen,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/bigmediumjosh?lang=en">Josh Clark</a>, the creator of the popular running app <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/av/stories-45485776/anybody-can-run-the-story-of-couch-to-5k">Couch to 5K</a> and founder of the design studio <a href="https://bigmedium.com/">Big Medium</a>. “Our phones became the main event, the computers we use most throughout the day.” </p><p>All these factors meant companies had to make tough decisions about what functionality to prioritize — a task designers were uniquely suited for. </p><h3 id="data-data-data"><a href="#data-data-data">Data, data, data</a></h3><p>At the same time, mobile phones brought an avalanche of new information about users. Huge swaths of the population had  pocket-sized computers that could see, hear, and interact with what was nearby. People used their phones constantly, resulting in what technologist <a href="https://twitter.com/jongold">Jon Gold</a> called  “infinitely more data than anything we’d seen in 2.5 decades of software development.”</p><p>Product teams started running constant A/B tests on UI variations. They’d experiment with button color or text, seeing how it impacted sign ups, purchases, shares, or other behavior. Companies — with Facebook leading the charge — started hiring more designers to power these experiments, and <a href="https://firstround.com/review/defining-growth-design-the-guide-to-the-role-most-startups-are-missing/">data-driven design</a> became its own discipline. </p><p>“They’re constantly nudging stuff for growth, and I don’t remember that being a job 20 years ago,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/mayli">May-Li Khoe</a>, former VP of Design at Khan Academy. “Smartphone adoption and data usage have totally changed what design even means in the last 10 years.&#34; She&#39;s had a front row seat for this, having worked in tech <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maylikhoe/">for decades</a>, with long stints at Microsoft and Apple.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8197fc95c41bdbcc69f842026df7dc319c704973-1994x1338.png?rect=1,0,1992,1338&amp;w=670&amp;h=450&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8197fc95c41bdbcc69f842026df7dc319c704973-1994x1338.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8197fc95c41bdbcc69f842026df7dc319c704973-1994x1338.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8197fc95c41bdbcc69f842026df7dc319c704973-1994x1338.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8197fc95c41bdbcc69f842026df7dc319c704973-1994x1338.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8197fc95c41bdbcc69f842026df7dc319c704973-1994x1338.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>From 2011-2019, the percentage of US adults who own a smartphone has risen from 35% to 81% according to the Pew Research Center.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="the-apple-design-effect"><a href="#the-apple-design-effect">The Apple design effect</a></h3><p>The last big impact the iPhone had on UI/UX design is an obvious one: It set the gold standard. “Applications used to be gray, bland, functional affairs imposed upon us to do the mundane tasks of the day,” Josh Clark said. “Mobile really blew that up.”</p><p>Of course, Apple had always invested in design more than most tech companies, but in the late nineties and 2000’s people balked at the price of Macs compared to PCs. So Macs stayed fringe, mostly found in hipster creative fields like video production and graphic design. </p><p>The iPhone, with its initial $499 price tag, was a little more accessible to a certain audience. It became a visible status symbol, and changed the mainstream public’s expectations for how tech products should look and feel. “It was the first time everyone and their dog could see: This looks prettier than the other thing,” said <a href="https://jon.gold/">Jon Gold</a>. </p><p>For better or <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3053406/how-apple-is-giving-design-a-bad-name">worse</a>, companies wanted to be like Apple. Consumers wanted to use products that felt like Apple. We all had iPhone-envy, and mobile-first businesses like Tinder took their design cues from the operating system that gave rise to them.

A few factors lowered the barrier to entry: </p><ol><li><strong>Venture funding:</strong> Because of the 2008 recession, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/business/economy/17fed.html">Federal Reserve</a> held the interest rate at almost 0% — the lowest in US history — for 7 years. That <a href="https://tomtunguz.com/interest-rates-and-startups/">encouraged a flood of extra money</a> into the tech startup marketplace from traditionally risk adverse Limited Partners, like university endowments.</li><li><strong>AWS:</strong> Amazon re-introduced <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2006/08/24/announcing-amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-amazon-ec2---beta/">AWS in 2006</a>, so companies could spin up instances of cloud-powered services without having to run their own server farms. By 2010 many companies were adopting this approach.</li><li><strong>GitHub &amp; open source:</strong> GitHub was founded in 2008 and rose to prominence in the last decade, popularizing open source programming initiatives. Instead of having to start from scratch, companies could adapt open source code to the needs of their own product.</li></ol><p>GitHub investor Peter Levine led <a href="https://a16z.com/2012/07/09/software-eats-software-development-2/">Andreessen Horowitz’s</a> $100 million Series A in the company. He sees a lot of parallels between programming’s expansion in previous decade and what’s happening in design today. </p><p>“Design represents a fundamental shift in competitive advantage,” he said. “Ten-plus years ago it was all about the code. Now it will be about the elegance of design as a first principle of software development.”</p><p>In decades past, many companies could rely on the fact that they’d secured capital and built a reliable product as a moat. They might face one or two other big competitors who’d done the same, but otherwise they’d gotten past the hardest part: Coming into existence. In the last decade that shifted and software ate the world.

To handle the transition to mobile, they needed people trained in the power of distilling complexity to its fundamental elements. Naturally, once users got accustomed to beautiful and easy-to-use experiences on mobile, that raised their standard for all user interfaces. At the same time, it got easier to start and build a tech company than ever before, so companies faced far more competitors and had to differentiate via their user experience. </p><p>The first step for a startup looking to invest in design? Naturally, hire more designers! In doing market research for academic planning, UC Berkeley  <a href="https://engineering.berkeley.edu/2019/06/college-engineering-and-college-environmental-design-launch-new-master-design-program">found that</a> demand for employees trained in emerging technology and design has grown by 250% in the past 10 years. </p><p>We  <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/31/here-are-some-reasons-behind-techs-design-shortage/">surveyed</a> a handful of enterprise companies in 2017, who told us they had dramatically increased their design hiring. (We’re planning to update the stats in 2020 for both consumer and enterprise companies.

She remembers struggling to find design internships in 2012. &#34;Nowadays, almost every company hires at least one design intern,&#34; she said.</p><p>As demand for trained designers increased, hiring became more difficult. <a href="https://twitter.com/soleio">Soleio Cuervo</a> experienced this first hand as an early design lead at Facebook and Dropbox. Now he tries to help solve the issue for other people through <a href="https://combine.vc/">Combine</a>, the venture capital firm he co-founded.</p><p>“Design recruiting has consistently been cited as the most desirable and valuable service we can provide portfolio companies,” Soleio explained.</p><h2 id="the-ripple-effect-in-education"><a href="#the-ripple-effect-in-education">The ripple effect in education</a></h2><p>At the start of the decade, traditional universities and even design schools hadn’t cottoned onto the demand. At Berkeley, one of the few tech design classes (<a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figma-transformed-this-berkeley-design-class/">CS160 — Introduction to Human Computer Interaction</a>) was often over subscribed, and doubled the class size one year to meet the need.</p><p>The student-taught elective on Photoshop and Illustrator fared even worse. It could fit 30 people, and once had 300 show up for it. “I believe it was harder to get accepted into it than it was to get into Berkeley,” remembered <a href="https://twitter.com/shanawho">Shana Hu</a>, one of the chosen students.</p><p>To help expand its design curriculum, Berkeley took several steps:</p><ol><li><strong>Built the Jacobs Institute:</strong> In 2014, Berkeley <a href="https://scet.berkeley.edu/berkeley-engineering-launches-the-jacobs-institute-of-design/">opened the doors</a> of the Jacobs Institute for Design Innovation. Part of the engineering school, Jacobs <a href="https://jacobsinstitute.berkeley.edu/learn/courses/">now offers a wide range of design classes</a> in interdisciplinary fields like robotics and mobility.</li><li><strong>Introduced a new design degree:</strong> In 2019 Berkeley went even farther by introducing a new master’s program in design, with a focus on emerging technologies.</li></ol><p>&#34;It was very exciting to see that,&#34; Shana said. She made the most of the options available and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanahu/">landed a job</a> at Pinterest as a designer when she graduated.</p><p>Berkeley&#39;s moves, although welcomed by students and employers alike, raise an age old debate: Should the job market really dictate education curriculum? May-Li Khoe urged schools developing design programs to take a thoughtful approach (especially in regards to ethics), and not just teach it as an empty skill.</p><p>“Both coding and design have many aspects beyond vocational training,” she said. “They can shape how you think, how you see the world, how you create, how you express, how you problem solve.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/221519a8d92a9f5994883fd3ca65b910db9193ff-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/221519a8d92a9f5994883fd3ca65b910db9193ff-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/221519a8d92a9f5994883fd3ca65b910db9193ff-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/221519a8d92a9f5994883fd3ca65b910db9193ff-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/221519a8d92a9f5994883fd3ca65b910db9193ff-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/221519a8d92a9f5994883fd3ca65b910db9193ff-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="alternative-routes"><a href="#alternative-routes">Alternative routes</a></h3><p>Not every campus adapted as quickly as Berkeley. To bridge the gap, several bootcamps emerged in the last decade, from General Assembly (2011) to Lambda School (2017). </p><p>Online courses also got more sophisticated. In 2014, design leader <a href="https://twitter.com/MengTo">Meng To</a> released a <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/design-code">self-published book</a> called Design + Code, which rose to prominence quickly. He eventually hired a team and developed it into a <a href="https://designcode.io/">full-blown educational website</a>.</p><p>“I think students are starting to realize that in order to be successful, they need to use the latest tools and techniques,” said Meng. “Traditional schools simply don’t work if you are in tech.”</p><p>Many UX/UI designers found their way into the career through these kinds of sideways avenues. Front-end programmers read classic design theory books and studied basic usability principles. Graphic designers taught themselves to code. Classically trained graduates from design colleges created websites for local businesses.</p><p>It’s no wonder then that as design matures in the industry, it’s splintering into many specializations, from research, to design systems, to UX writing, to growth. <a href="https://twitter.com/michelephant">Michelle Morrison</a>, a senior design program manager at Dropbox, pointed out that in the past, one or two people might have done all of these jobs at a company. “Now we have full-stack design teams that can go deep on these problems,” she said.</p><p>As design evolved, so did design tooling. As a long-time Figmate, I have obvious bias on the subject, so...you know. Disclaimer ;).</p><p>Before 2010, most people who needed to design apps and interfaces were using Photoshop -- which literally has the word ‘photo’ in its name. That posed challenges, because digital design is a lot different than print. For example, print graphics appear on physical objects of a fixed size, but digital graphics are represented on screens of many different sizes (especially once mobile hit). For awhile, designers leaned on an Adobe screen design tool called Fireworks, but they discontinued it.</p><h3 id="a-dizzying-array-of-options"><a href="#a-dizzying-array-of-options">A dizzying array of options</a></h3><p>So everyone welcomed the launch of UI design tool Sketch, bootstrapped out of Europe in 2010. The time was right, and Sketch kick - started a wave of design tool innovation across many different sectors, not just UI. </p><p>Many tools emerged to focus on specific parts of the toolchain that were underserved by Sketch, like prototyping (Framer and InVision) or version control (Abstract) or developer handoff (Zeplin). Some applications focused on a particular type of design, like websites (Webflow) or new audiences like non-designers (Canva). Adobe introduced XD - its answer to the broader UI design need.  </p><p>As Meng To put it: “It’s both amazing and overwhelming to designers. We’re faced with so many choices.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa003bca9c6df0ae5709dc20267b7fc1b299a76c-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa003bca9c6df0ae5709dc20267b7fc1b299a76c-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa003bca9c6df0ae5709dc20267b7fc1b299a76c-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa003bca9c6df0ae5709dc20267b7fc1b299a76c-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa003bca9c6df0ae5709dc20267b7fc1b299a76c-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa003bca9c6df0ae5709dc20267b7fc1b299a76c-2000x1400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="design-in-the-browser"><a href="#design-in-the-browser">Design in the browser</a></h3><p>As for Figma? We took an unconventional approach by building our professional UI design tool on the web. It had never been done before, in part because browser technology had been limited in its graphic processing abilities. But in 2011, the advent of a Javascript API <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL">called WebGL</a> made it possible.</p><p>It’s fair to say that at first people thought we were crazy for putting a design tool in the browser (just <a href="https://www.designernews.co/stories/74791-figma-10">check out the comments on DesignerNews</a> from our 2016 launch out of beta). <a href="https://twitter.com/johnolilly">John Lilly</a>, the investor at Greylock who led our Series A in 2015, took a chance on us anyway. His decision was motivated by the fact that a browser-based tool could open up the design process to everyone, like Google Docs for visual collaboration.</p><p>That’s the direction we went in, and after we honed our tool for designers, we launched a code panel for developer handoff and prototyping mode for user testing and presentations. Because files could be shared by a URL, and there were no exporting-syncing challenges, a Figma file became a source of truth that designers, engineers, product managers, copy-writers, and others could work together in. </p><p>As John put it: “Designing products, like everything else we do, is a team sport, but it was held back by the tooling.”</p><h3 id="the-design-arms-race"><a href="#the-design-arms-race">The design arms race</a></h3><p>Tools have the power to change the way we think and what we can accomplish (as Wilson Miner explored in <a href="https://vimeo.com/34017777">his excellent 2011 talk</a>). And every design tool launched in the last decade has expanded the opportunities and possibilities for interface design.</p><p>In the last few years, venture capital investors cottoned onto the opportunity. Just in the professional UI design tool industry, 7 startups have raised over half a billion in venture from 20+ firms, and much of that happened in the last year alone. <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/top-venture-capital-partners/">Five of the top venture capital firms</a> have placed their bets.</p><p>I asked John — who was relatively early to the space in 2015 — why he thinks design is the new VC passion. “I always think of Willie Sutton’s response to the question of why he robbed banks,” John said. “‘Because that’s where the money is.’”</p><h2 id="what-comes-next"><a href="#what-comes-next">What comes next?</a></h2><p>Wow, what a journey. It’s hard to believe how much has happened in 10 years alone — mobile sped up the pace of everything, design included. </p><p>Now that design has secured its seat at the table, it’s time to use that power for good. In the past 10 years, a lot of concerns have been raised about technology’s impact, from digital addiction to the spread of fake news. Many people we interviewed mentioned the moral responsibilities that lie ahead. </p><p>“Designers need to look to communities (typically underserved communities) that have long considered the ethics of designed objects, tangible and intangible,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/amelielamont">Amélie Lamont</a>, who runs a <a href="https://amelie.is/">product design studio</a> out of Brooklyn. She cautioned the industry against thinking of design ethics as a “new” idea. </p><p>The topic felt like it deserved its own story, instead of being shoe-horned into an already lengthy exploration of the past decade, so stay tuned for that follow-on. In the meanwhile, we’ll let Jon Gold close out this story with some final thoughts:</p><p>“The next 10 years are going to be critically important for the long term survival of the planet and of human civilization. We’ve seen what technology can do in a decade, so let’s make the next one count.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Design more, resize less, with Auto Layout</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-auto-layout/</link>
      <description>With Auto Layout buttons can resize with their text. Lists can rearrange themselves when items are moved around. And elements can be nested to create complex interfaces which respond to their content.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re happy to announce that Auto Layout is now live in Figma! </p><p>Buttons can resize with their text. Lists can rearrange themselves when items are moved around. And elements can be nested to create complex interfaces which respond to their content.</p><p>Building Auto Layout has been a fun but long journey for us. It’s something we’ve wanted to do for a while, but it took quite a few design iterations for it to feel right.</p><h2 id="the-challenge-of-bringing-design-and-development"><a href="#the-challenge-of-bringing-design-and-development">The challenge of bringing design and development together</a></h2><p>At its heart, Figma is a design tool. It enables free-form exploration using core concepts like paths, layers, and groups. But this free-form nature can lead to lots of repetitive work. For example, a seemingly simple update to button text takes far too many steps—edit text, resize button, move adjacent button, and so on. </p><p>Meanwhile, production environments like HTML/CSS and SwiftUI are much better at describing the structure of a UI and the relationships between objects—which makes changing things like button copy far less painstaking. However, free-form design exploration is near impossible in these environments. </p><p>So in building our Auto Layout feature, we wanted to marry these two worlds. How do we combine the ease of making edits in production while preserving the free-form nature of Figma?</p><p>Like many design challenges, the end result may look obvious in hindsight. After trying many different approaches, including some rather non-conventional ones, we felt the best way to marry the two worlds was to add a few core concepts from the CSS box model (specifically flexbox) directly into Figma. And by introducing Auto Layout as a property, you have the flexibility and power to apply Auto Layout to any frame, whether it’s in a component or not.</p><h2 id="how-auto-layout-works"><a href="#how-auto-layout-works">How Auto Layout works</a></h2><p>When you add Auto Layout to a frame, the items inside are stacked next to each other (either vertically or horizontally). The frame&#39;s size is then determined by the total size of the items within it. Auto Layout frames can have their own padding, fill, stroke and corner radius, so you can create buttons without adding additional layers.</p><figure></figure><p>This makes last minute requests like tweaking button copy from “Buy” to “Add to basket” a breeze. As you edit the text, the frame resizes automatically. And if you stack some buttons next to each other, they all move as you would expect. (Note: the one difference from the CSS model is that spacing between items is done at a container level. If you need to adjust the spacing between individual items, you will need to do a little bit of extra work.)</p><div><blockquote><p>Generally speaking, Auto Layout is just pure genius. It’s so fast and will speed up our workflow so much; I just can’t wait to apply it to our design system.</p></blockquote><div><p>— Charles de Dreuille, Product Designer, Facebook</p></div></div><p>Beyond buttons, Auto Layout is particularly useful when creating designs with repeated UI elements, like lists and menus. Instead of countless clicks to move elements to their right spots, a simple drag and drop now does the trick.</p><figure></figure><div><blockquote><p>It&#39;s awesome. I love the functionality it introduces and especially find the automatic reordering incredibly useful.</p></blockquote><div><p>— Joel Nasrallah, Prototyping &amp; Design Tooling, Atlassian</p></div></div><p>Additionally, if you have existing component libraries and design systems, you can now apply Auto Layout to each component by pressing Shift + A or from the Option menu. </p><h2 id="nesting-your-frames"><a href="#nesting-your-frames">Nesting your frames</a></h2><p>These individual Auto Layout elements can be combined into full interfaces by nesting Auto Layout frames in much the same way that div tags can be nested in HTML. Just as you would in a production environment, you can easily edit content and move things in or out of Auto Layout frames.</p><p>The feature does have a “safeguard”, which tries to prevent you from doing things that you probably don’t want to do anyways, like dragging a large image inside a button. But just in case that was your intent, you can override the safeguard by holding down the command key (ctrl on Windows).</p><figure></figure><div><blockquote><p>Auto Layout is an absolute pain-remover. It solves so many issues and allows me to make way more generic components with basic controls, instead of new components for variations in content.</p></blockquote><div><p>— Guilhem Gantois, UX Consultant, Microsoft</p></div></div><p>With Auto Layout, we hope that designing interfaces in Figma now feels a bit more like the way you build interfaces with code.</p><h2 id="what-s-next"><a href="#what-s-next">What’s next?</a></h2><p>Just refresh your browser window to start using Auto Layout. For some help getting started, explore all that Auto Layout offers in this <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/file/784448220678228461/">playground file</a>, watch this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrKX46DzkGQ">video</a>, or read the <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/453-auto-layout">documentation</a>.</p><p>By the way, this is just the beginning—we wanted to include so much more in our first release, but we also know you’ve all been waiting patiently to start using this.</p><p>We would love to learn about how you use Auto Layout and hear your feedback and feature requests.

      <title>Humanity at work: Gusto brings a new brand to life with Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/gusto/</link>
      <description>Take a look at how Gusto used Figma to create a top-to-bottom brand experience that’s all about people.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From selling and repairing bicycles to roasting coffee and delivering fitness classes, small businesses empower local communities everywhere, creating jobs, sparking innovation, and injecting revenue into the local economy. When small businesses thrive, people thrive, and that’s where <a href="https://gusto.com/company-news/gusto-brand-refresh">Gusto</a> comes in. </p><p>Launched in 2012 as ZenPayroll, Gusto serves more than 100,000 small businesses, helping them take care of their hardworking teams by automating and simplifying payroll, benefits and human resources. </p><p>While Gusto’s customers love the platform, the company didn’t feel that its brand truly reflected the human experience of how Gusto serves its customers. The time was right for a <a href="https://gusto.com/brand">brand refresh</a> that would unite the company in its brand awareness, product development and customer experience efforts.  </p><p>This is a look at how Gusto used Figma to create a top-to-bottom brand experience that’s all about people.</p><h2 id="believing-in-the-re-brand"><a href="#believing-in-the-re-brand">Believing in the (re)brand</a></h2><p>To help it reach even greater numbers of small businesses, Gusto needed to grow its brand awareness. But before it started addressing awareness issues, the Gusto team realized that the timing was ideal to rethink the brand and align everything from the logo to the platform around a unified brand philosophy and approach.</p><p>“We believe that your brand is not something owned by a marketing department or a brand design team,” says Micah Panama, creative director and head of brand design at Gusto. “It&#39;s the sum of the experiences that your users have with everything you do.”</p><p>Once company stakeholders bought into the rebrand effort, one of the biggest challenges the design team faced was getting the entire company on board with the project. “Shipping the brand meant getting 1,000 people across the company aligned on what the brand is, believing in it, and then taking it to the world,” says Panama. “That’s why it was critical for us to have everyone using one tool throughout the effort, where they can see what’s being developed, communicate with each other, share ideas, and take ownership.”</p><div><blockquote><p>Read more about the new Gusto brand in this <a href="https://gusto.com/company-news/gusto-brand-refresh">article</a> from Tomer London, co-founder and CPO at Gusto.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="inviting-non-designers-into-the-process"><a href="#inviting-non-designers-into-the-process">Inviting non-designers into the process</a></h2><p>Gusto used Figma as a core tool throughout the rebranding effort for everything from mood boards to billboards, typography to user interface design. “When we first started using Figma, it was the best tool for designers we&#39;d ever used,” says Panama. “But it quickly became a collaborative presentation tool for all the teams working on the rebranding, including the content team, product marketing management team, acquisition team, and others.” </p><p>As a collaborative tool, Figma helped the brand team build effective communication with all the stakeholders throughout the project. “What&#39;s interesting about Figma is that people can actually see things happening in real time,” says Panama. “It exposes stakeholders to how design works, which I think helps build empathy and understanding of the value of design.” </p><p>Namhee Koo, head of product design at Gusto, sees the communication and collaboration within Figma as critical to creating the right experience for Gusto customers. “We believe that having our internal teams really closely connected and working together makes our designs better and creates a more cohesive brand experience for our customers,” she says.</p><div><blockquote><p>“With Figma, people outside of design can see how the ‘sausage’ is made and what we are doing. With features like commenting, it’s easy to have a dialogue right there in the file rather than in some silo between two people on email or Slack.”</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="one-team-one-brand"><a href="#one-team-one-brand">One team, one brand</a></h2><p>For Panama and Koo, it was important that product and brand were equal contributors to the rebranding work. To achieve that, they organized joint brainstorming sessions and workshops with the product design and brand teams to work through the color palette, typography, and starter templates exemplifying the new brand in the product.</p><p>“Using Figma to build things together meant that we were all aligned and moving forward in one direction,” says Panama. Will Tsui, product design lead at Gusto, highlighted a moment when the culture of collaboration really came to life. “A designer on our Design Systems team led a working session called Refresca with the whole team, along with real Fresca refreshments. Everyone worked together in Figma to apply elements of the new brand to the different areas of our product experience. As we walked through our brand starter template, it was so powerful to see everyone’s cursors following along.&#34;</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f3adbf20b7f6ad054d61985a0d6f07631023ce7a-1600x1200.jpg?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f3adbf20b7f6ad054d61985a0d6f07631023ce7a-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f3adbf20b7f6ad054d61985a0d6f07631023ce7a-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f3adbf20b7f6ad054d61985a0d6f07631023ce7a-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f3adbf20b7f6ad054d61985a0d6f07631023ce7a-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f3adbf20b7f6ad054d61985a0d6f07631023ce7a-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/265e28e8b596aa94be94f57598f937fb9e00a06b-1600x1200.jpg?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/265e28e8b596aa94be94f57598f937fb9e00a06b-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/265e28e8b596aa94be94f57598f937fb9e00a06b-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/265e28e8b596aa94be94f57598f937fb9e00a06b-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/265e28e8b596aa94be94f57598f937fb9e00a06b-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/265e28e8b596aa94be94f57598f937fb9e00a06b-1600x1200.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Based on the initial brand guidelines and the working sessions, the product team began creating a new user interface kit to apply to the Gusto platform. Tsui believes that Figma was instrumental in facilitating the translation from brand to product. “Our goal was not just to represent the new brand throughout the product experience. We wanted to go above and beyond by choosing special moments to bring the brand forward in inspiring ways,” he says. In having the two teams equally involved in the early stage of the rebrand, the process of applying the new brand to every aspect of the product experience was seamless.  </p><h2 id="scaling-design-efforts-across-products"><a href="#scaling-design-efforts-across-products">Scaling design efforts across products</a></h2><p>Another goal of the rebrand was to align on how designers would work together and build the supporting systems that could scale with the company. As Panama puts it, “we needed a system of record for what our product should look like.” To create this system, the product design team built a UI kit using Figma libraries and components, which was informed by the guidelines from the brand team.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c5c03f8b43a8c79000f9369c3b286e7c8f60ac65-1600x801.png?rect=0,0,1600,800&amp;w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c5c03f8b43a8c79000f9369c3b286e7c8f60ac65-1600x801.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c5c03f8b43a8c79000f9369c3b286e7c8f60ac65-1600x801.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c5c03f8b43a8c79000f9369c3b286e7c8f60ac65-1600x801.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c5c03f8b43a8c79000f9369c3b286e7c8f60ac65-1600x801.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c5c03f8b43a8c79000f9369c3b286e7c8f60ac65-1600x801.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>For Koo, the brand refresh was the perfect opportunity to build a foundation for design consistency and align all of its product design around the new brand. “We wanted to create a design language that&#39;s more consistent, accessible and usable and build that into an updated design system,” she says.</p><h2 id="rebranding-120-webpages"><a href="#rebranding-120-webpages">Rebranding 120+ webpages</a></h2><p>Natalie Schoch is a designer on the brand team at Gusto and was the lead on redesigning the company’s website as part of the rebranding effort. “Rebrands can be messy and complicated.

      <title>Under the hood of Figma’s infrastructure: Here’s what goes into powering a web-based design tool</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/under-the-hood-of-figmas-infrastructure/</link>
      <description>Scaling infrastructure at a fast-growth startup</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Figma, we believe design tools should prioritize two things above all else: speed and stability. </p><p>Designers spend hours each day in the tool painstakingly creating new worlds. They repeat actions again and again, drawing shapes, setting styles, dragging in UI elements from the company’s broader design system. The tool becomes an extension of their mind and needs to keep up with their speed of thought. </p><p>The work of the infrastructure team at Figma is important because we’re responsible for the ultimate performance, scale and availability of our collaborative design tool. Most people don’t believe a web-based application can be as fast as a desktop one and it’s our job to prove them wrong. </p><p>It’s a big, bold challenge, which is what inspired me to join Figma 7 months ago to lead the infrastructure team. I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samirkgoel/">long history</a> of working on building large scale distributed systems, first at Google and then at Dropbox.</p><p>I get asked a lot about what infrastructure work is like at Figma in comparison. So I decided to offer a peek into how our infrastructure is set up, what challenges we’re tackling and what’s next for our system. We’re evolving it from a simple but operationally intensive back-end typical of a young startup to a more mature system capable of handling our performance and scaling needs. Read on for details…</p><h2 id="figma-101"><a href="#figma-101">Figma 101</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f9181f95bfaf1ea787da0e6d9eb9e60bdf432d65-1600x759.png?rect=0,0,1599,759&amp;w=670&amp;h=318&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f9181f95bfaf1ea787da0e6d9eb9e60bdf432d65-1600x759.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f9181f95bfaf1ea787da0e6d9eb9e60bdf432d65-1600x759.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f9181f95bfaf1ea787da0e6d9eb9e60bdf432d65-1600x759.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f9181f95bfaf1ea787da0e6d9eb9e60bdf432d65-1600x759.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f9181f95bfaf1ea787da0e6d9eb9e60bdf432d65-1600x759.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>For those not familiar with Figma, we’re a web-based design tool (think Google Docs for design). Traditionally, designers worked in siloed desktop applications that only ran on certain types of platforms. If other people didn’t have the tool downloaded and installed, they couldn’t access the work. Designers had to export files and switch to other third party tools for prototyping and developer handoff. As they iterated and shuffled files across these systems, it became easy to lose track of the latest version, making collaborative teamwork painful if not impossible. Very 1990s. </p><p>In contrast, each design file in Figma is a living, breathing entity that is constantly evolving. The design lives in the cloud and has a unique URL, so it serves as the source of truth for the entire team. Different people across the organization can collaborate on the design, provide feedback, check in to see how the work is evolving, or flag issues that might occur down the line in implementation. </p><p>Plus, Figma has prototyping and developer handoff features baked natively into the tool, so stakeholders can view prototypes and developers can pull data from that same source of truth file. In other words, no more questioning whether you’re looking at the latest version of the work.</p><p>To enable effective team collaboration, Figma has a <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">multiplayer functionality</a> that allows multiple people to simultaneously view / edit a file. The files often involve complex shapes and big images, resulting in large amounts of data that must be sent across the network to the backend infrastructure.</p><p>Designers come to Figma from standalone desktop applications, and they expect comparable or better interaction performance. Add all these factors together and you have fertile ground for intriguing technical challenges. </p><figure><figcaption>Multiplayer in action</figcaption></figure><h2 id="infrastructure-2-0"><a href="#infrastructure-2-0">Infrastructure 2.0</a></h2><p>Our infrastructure was built for an early world, when Figma was used by smaller teams. Back then, we relied on simple strategies to build our back-end, enabling us to be very nimble. For example, we loaded all the shared components available to a user in Figma during file load. </p><p>This strategy works well when you have access to thousands of <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/66-components">shared design elements</a> in your organization’s library, but the back-end system starts to strain as the number of design elements nears 10,000. This kind of scale is becoming more and more common, both as our global user base grows and as Figma spreads across very large organizations like Microsoft and Uber.</p><p>So, over the past year we embarked on a journey to build the next generation of Figma’s infrastructure, optimized for scale. Below is a brief overview of some of the projects underway or planned.</p><h3 id="speeding-up-interaction-latencies"><a href="#speeding-up-interaction-latencies">Speeding up interaction latencies</a></h3><p>As mentioned above, there are still a number of places where the Figma app preloads more data upfront than is necessary to get users into their files. Doing so puts a strain on the back-end, and addressing the problem isn’t trivial — many parts of our product have come to rely on it. </p><p>As a result, it’s not just about speeding up the back end — we need to redesign the entire client-server interaction so the client asks for information only as needed. This will require collaborating with other teams at Figma to rethink the user experience. It’s an exciting opportunity — in this fast-moving industry, it’s not every day that an infrastructure team can take such a thoughtful, holistic approach to scaling a product.</p><h3 id="scaling-the-database"><a href="#scaling-the-database">Scaling the database</a></h3><p>One of things people are most shocked to learn about Figma’s infrastructure is that it’s backed by a single database instance running on one of the beefiest machine in AWS. Surprising, right? We are a big fan of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS design principle</a> and this simple approach has gotten us pretty far. But we’re reaching the limits of what such an architecture can support, so we need to build a new database layer that scales horizontally. This is a big and hairy project, and we’ll need to think through the implications for all the systems and services that rely on the database (which is pretty much everything!).</p><h3 id="performance-for-international-users"><a href="#performance-for-international-users">Performance for international users</a></h3><p>More than 80% of our weekly active users are outside the US. Their interaction latencies are a function of round-trip time to our datacenter in Oregon. To speed up their experience, we want to deploy certain infrastructure components closer to users. As a first step we’ll be strategically placing remote proxies across the globe. Next, we’ll be experimenting with deploying instances of our Multiplayer service closer to our users. </p><p>In Figma’s infrastructure, a design file is mapped to one instance of Multiplayer. As we expand internationally, we’ll need to figure out the best datacenter for each document according to user location. Working on a system that spans multiple datacenters makes for fun, complex problem solving. </p><h3 id="livegraph"><a href="#livegraph">LiveGraph</a></h3><p>Our most ambitious undertaking is a schema-based, real-time database system called LiveGraph, which is inspired by GraphQL. Our goal with this project is to make it easier for engineers across Figma to build new responsive features in our tool. Currently, our developers must build specialized backend and frontend systems for each one. </p><p>LiveGraph obviates the need for that by detecting relevant changes in the underlying database, filtering updates based on client’s access permissions and pushing relevant updates to the client in real-time.  In other words, it allows a client to subscribe to a query and receive push notifications whenever the results of the query change. Over time we expect it to become a core part of our infrastructure that powers several features such as relaying new user comments, newly published design elements, etc.</p><h2 id="we-re-hiring"><a href="#we-re-hiring">We’re hiring!</a></h2><p>These are just a few examples of the kinds of systems we will build along the way towards a more mature infrastructure that is performant and scalable. We’re also containerizing our services, offering APIs for our customers to built custom workflows around Figma, etc. Of course we continue to be responsible for security, our machine footprint in AWS, and continuous integration / deployment system. </p><p>Shaping the evolution of a company’s infrastructure is one of the most educative experiences one can have — you not only get a chance to rebuild core components from scratch but also learn to brutally prioritize the investments you make due to finite Engineering resources. We’re a small team, so you can have a big impact and get hands-on experience designing and building a lot of different systems.</p><p>If any of this captures your interest, we’re building out the infrastructure team now.

      <title>Opening up the data behind your design systems</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-design-system-analytics/</link>
      <description>Design System Analytics enables you to see library usage trends, compare libraries, and drill into component usage.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a browser-based tool built entirely in the cloud, Figma has the unique opportunity to provide visibility into how designers use the system. Today, we’re introducing Design System Analytics to make it easier for companies like Microsoft, Squarespace, or any <a href="https://www.figma.com/organization/">Figma Organization</a> customer to build and maintain their design systems with data. </p><p>Design System Analytics enables you to see library usage trends, compare libraries, and drill into component usage.</p><p>While building this feature, we worked closely with several customers to learn what they wanted out of analytics and what they didn’t. As a result, we focused on building analytics that illuminate how your design systems are used across your teams, without policing designers’ every move. </p><p>Here are some examples from our beta customers about what they’re learning from analytics and how they’re taking action on these insights.</p><h2 id="learn-what-s-working-and-what-s-not"><a href="#learn-what-s-working-and-what-s-not">Learn what’s working, and what’s not</a></h2><p>With insights into library and component usage, design system managers can make ongoing improvements with quantitative feedback. </p><p>Microsoft’s Damien Aistrope, Principal Designer on the Fluent design system, explains, “There are so many teams at Microsoft using Fluent, and we don’t always get feedback from them about what’s working and what’s not. So it’s helpful for us to see which components aren’t being used and not important to maintain, as well as which components are often detached and may need updating.” </p><p>At Google, this type of data feedback is helping teams uncover new opportunities to evolve components on an ongoing basis. When reviewing the new analytics reports, Philippe Cao, a Senior Visual Designer on the Material Design Team, discovered that the button component was used and detached more than any other component. This helped him realize that the master component was overly complex and that he should create a simpler version in addition to it, giving designers on his team the flexibility they needed.</p><h2 id="understand-how-libraries-are-used"><a href="#understand-how-libraries-are-used">Understand how libraries are used</a></h2><p>With the ability to compare the usage of two libraries over time, Design System Analytics can also help you keep a pulse on library adoption.</p><p>For example, the Design Platform Team at Squarespace is working on replacing an existing shared library with a new version that makes use of our upcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1176150305379160065">Auto-Layout</a> capabilities. <br/>With Design System Analytics, they’ll be able to track adoption of the new library across teams as well as ensure deprecation of the old version.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670&amp;h=477&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4a7d23fd2b9817a9c076319b38d3f8caf0a8a12e-1784x1270.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Compare usage of two libraries over time to track migration.</figcaption></figure><p>Going beyond just library usage trends, you can also dig into how individual components are being used. Designers at Pluralsight, an online education company, are excited to use Design System Analytics to surface how their teammates are using shared components from their <a href="https://design-system.pluralsight.com/">design system</a>. Because Figma allows for open collaboration and Design System Analytics are viewable by anyone at your organization, any designer or manager can quickly view reports they care about or find examples to learn from.</p><h2 id="measure-the-impact-of-design-earlier"><a href="#measure-the-impact-of-design-earlier">Measure the impact of design earlier</a></h2><p>With analytics that enable you to look under the hood of your design system libraries, you can also measure design system adoption earlier in the product development process. </p><p>For example, the team at Bukalapak, one of the largest e-commerce companies in Indonesia, had previously measured design system adoption in the development phase, by analyzing component usage in their iOS and Android codebases. Now with Design System Analytics in Figma, the Bukalapak team has insight into library and component adoption much earlier, in the design phase, which gives them more confidence in what they ship to development. </p><p>We loved hearing what our customers are already doing with these new insights and can’t wait to learn more so we can continue to build upon this feature. </p><p>To learn what you can do with Design System Analytics, <a href="https://figma.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_LSX4PGPlRU-oz_PqcjAOvg">tune in</a> tomorrow, November 21st at 9 am PST,  for a live demo.

While many things have changed, one thing has not: the community continues to learn from each other. Because design is constantly evolving, designers look to their peers for inspiration, knowledge, and ideas.</p><p>That’s why we <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-community/">announced last week</a> we’re bringing the Figma community into the product with a public space for publishing live design files and connecting with others inside the tool. Today we’re building on that momentum by announcing our first conference — an IRL space for our users to come together to learn from each other.</p><h2 id="contribute-your-ideas"><a href="#contribute-your-ideas">Contribute your ideas</a></h2><p>We’re shaping the conference programming around our community, structuring many sessions as shorter lightning talks, workshops, and roundtables to give a broader array of Figma users the chance to contribute. Although we’ll have a few keynotes, we hope to give new voices the opportunity to share as well. </p><p>To do this, we need your help.</p><p>Have you built something cool that you want to share? Have you learned a lesson the hard way or have a topic you want to discuss with peers? Do you have a collaborative activity in Figma that you can share?<br/>Submit your ideas in our <a href="https://figmaconference.typeform.com/to/XzMLy9"><strong>Call for Proposals</strong></a>. Sessions can be as short as 15 minutes or as long as an hour.  </p><p>You can submit a proposal or nominate someone else you&#39;d like to see speak. All proposals are due by November 20, 2019, at 11:59 pm PST.</p><p><a href="https://figmaconference.typeform.com/to/XzMLy9">Submit a proposal</a></p><h2 id="join-us"><a href="#join-us">Join us</a></h2><p>We aim to create a conference where meaningful conversations can happen, so we’re starting small in terms of size. We also want to make sure the attendees of this conference promote diversity of ability, age, education, ethnicity, gender, race, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status.</p><p><a href="https://figmaconference.typeform.com/to/G4hIzL"><strong>Fill out this form</strong></a> if you’d like to attend. Please submit your application by November 20, 2019, at 11:59 pm PST. </p><p>We would love to accommodate as many people as we can but there is a chance we will sell out. As a result, we may be forced to use a lottery process to help ensure the final attendees represent a diverse group.</p><p>After the deadline, attendees will be notified and have a guaranteed week to buy their pass. </p><p>The conference is $299, but we don’t want cost to deter anyone from attending. We have a scholarship program for anyone who needs financial assistance to be able to attend.</p><p><a href="https://figmaconference.typeform.com/to/G4hIzL">I want to attend</a></p><p>We can’t wait to create this conference with you.

      <title>Beyond multiplayer: Building community together in Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-community/</link>
      <description>Today we’re introducing two new spaces in Figma: The Figma Community and a redesigned Figma workspace.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we started building <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/">multiplayer capabilities</a> in Figma four years ago, we weren’t positive that designers would embrace this new way to design. But we were motivated by the belief that design should be more open, cloud-first and on the Web. Thankfully, the community latched on and we’ve since seen big shifts in how designers approach their work.</p><p>Designers are opening up. They’re welcoming non-designers into their process. They’re co-editing with teammates. They’re sharing what they do and how they do it with the community. And they’re setting a new standard for the next generation.</p><p>So, today, Figma is evolving to make it even easier to open up the design process. As part of this, we’re introducing two new spaces in the product:</p><ul><li>The Figma Community, releasing in beta, is a public space where you can now publish live design files that anyone in the world can inspect, remix, and learn from.</li><li>Your Figma workspace, redesigned around the people in your team, makes it easier for anyone to discover the most important work and projects.</li></ul><p>Our users are the bedrock of the Figma Community, so we knew from the start we could never build this alone. Much like with plugins, the space will come to life with all of your involvement, and we’re excited to see what everyone comes up with.</p><p>In our first release of the Figma Community beta, you’ll be able to choose which files you want to publish to your public profile. The first license we’ll offer will be the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license</a>. We’re interested in exploring other more restrictive licenses in the future and would love to hear your feedback at <a href="mailto:community@figma.com">community@figma.com</a>.</p><figure></figure><p>Today’s the start of a multi-month beta, because we have a lot to learn. Here’s some of the feedback we’ve heard so far from companies, schools, government organizations and independent designers.</p><p>We heard from companies like <a href="https://www.figma.com/@slack">Slack</a> that they’d like to publish a UI kit to help their partners build better Slack apps.</p><figure><p><img

      <title>How Figma’s multiplayer technology works</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-figmas-multiplayer-technology-works/</link>
      <description>A peek into the homegrown solution we built as the first design tool with live collaborative editing.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>If you want to know more about where we’re headed next, check out <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-community/">&#34;Beyond multiplayer: Building community together in Figma&#34;</a>, where we share some exciting product announcements.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="NGfpIEGzqh6w" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>When we first started <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/multiplayer-editing-in-figma/">building multiplayer functionality</a> in <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> four years ago, we decided to develop our own solution. No other design tool offered this feature, and we didn’t want to use operational transforms (a.k.a. OTs), the standard multiplayer algorithm popularized by apps like Google Docs. As a startup we value the ability to ship features quickly, and OTs were unnecessarily complex for our problem space. So we built a custom multiplayer system that&#39;s simpler and easier to implement.</p><p>At the time, we weren’t sure building this feature was the right product decision. No one was clamoring for a multiplayer design tool — if anything, people hated the idea. Designers worried that live collaborative editing would result in “hovering art directors” and “design by committee” catastrophes.</p><p>But ultimately, we had to do it because it just felt wrong not to offer multiplayer as a tool on the web. It eliminates the need to export, sync, or email copies of files and allows more people to take part in the design process (like copy-writers and developers). Just by having the right link, everyone can view the current status of a design project without interrupting the person doing the work.  </p><p>Our bet paid off, and these days it’s obvious that multiplayer is the way all productivity tools on the web should work, not just design. But while we use products with live collaborative editing every day, there aren’t that many public case studies on these production systems.</p><p>We decided it was time to share a peek into how we did it at Figma, in the hopes of helping others. It should be a fun read for those who like seeing how computer science theory is applied in practice. We’ll cover a lot but each section builds upon the previous ones. By the end, you should hopefully have an understanding of the entire system.</p><h2 id="background-context-figma-s-setup-ots-and-more"><a href="#background-context-figma-s-setup-ots-and-more">Background context: Figma’s setup, OTs, and more</a></h2><p>Before talking about our multiplayer protocol, it&#39;s useful to have some context about how our multiplayer system is set up. We use a client/server architecture where Figma clients are web pages that talk with a cluster of servers over WebSockets. Our servers currently spin up a separate process for each multiplayer document which everyone editing that document connects to. If you’re interested in learning more, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/">this article</a> talks about how we scale our production multiplayer servers.</p><p>When a document is opened, the client starts by downloading a copy of the file. From that point on, updates to that document in both directions are synced over the WebSocket connection. Figma lets you go offline for an arbitrary amount of time and continue editing. When you come back online, the client downloads a fresh copy of the document, reapplies any offline edits on top of this latest state, and then continues syncing updates over a new WebSocket connection. This means that connecting and reconnecting are very simple and all of the complexity with multiplayer (which is what this blog post is about) is in dealing with updates to already connected documents.</p><p>It’s worth noting that we only use multiplayer for syncing changes to Figma documents. We also sync changes to a lot of other data (comments, users, teams, projects, etc.) but that is stored in Postgres, not our multiplayer system, and is synced with clients using a completely separate system that won’t be discussed in this article. Although these two systems are similar, they have separate implementations because of different tradeoffs around certain properties such as performance, offline availability, and security.</p><p>We didn&#39;t start with this setup though. When making a change this fundamental, it&#39;s important to be able to iterate quickly and experiment before committing to an approach. That&#39;s why we first created a prototype environment to test our ideas instead of working in the real codebase. This playground was a web page that simulated three clients connecting to a server and visualized the whole state of the system. It let us easily set up different scenarios around offline clients and bandwidth limited connections. </p><p>Once we figured out how we wanted to build our multiplayer system, it was straightforward to graft the ideas from our prototype onto our existing codebase. We used this prototype to quickly research and evaluate different collaborative algorithms and data structures.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?rect=0,0,1500,750&amp;w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8a6196bdd0f029131c81e45cc44e3dbf908e412-1500x751.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A screenshot of our internal prototype</figcaption></figure><h3 id="how-ots-and-crdts-informed-our-multiplayer"><a href="#how-ots-and-crdts-informed-our-multiplayer">How OTs and CRDTs informed our multiplayer approach</a></h3><p>Multiplayer technology has a rich history and has arguably been around at least since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">Douglas Engelbart&#39;s demo in 1968</a>. Before we dive in too deep into how our own multiplayer system works, it’s worth a quick overview on the traditional approaches that informed ours — OTs and CRDTs.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, OTs power most collaborative text-based apps such as Google Docs. They’re the most well-known technique but in researching them, we quickly realized they were overkill for what we wanted to achieve. They’re a great way of editing long text documents with low memory and performance overhead, but they are very complicated and hard to implement correctly. They result in a combinatorial explosion of possible states which is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation#Critique_of_OT">very difficult to reason about</a>. </p><p>Our primary goal when designing our multiplayer system was for it to be no more complex than necessary to get the job done. A simpler system is easier to reason about which then makes it easier to implement, debug, test, and maintain. Since Figma isn&#39;t a text editor, we didn&#39;t need the power of OTs and could get away with something less complicated. </p><p>Figma&#39;s tech is instead inspired by something called CRDTs, which stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type">Conflict-free Replicated Data Types</a>. CRDTs refer to a collection of different data structures commonly used in distributed systems. All CRDTs satisfy certain mathematical properties which guarantee eventual consistency. If no more updates are made, eventually everyone accessing the data structure will see the same thing. This constraint is required for correctness; we cannot allow two clients editing the same Figma document to diverge and never converge again.</p><p>There are many types of CRDTs. See <a href="https://github.com/pfrazee/crdt_notes/tree/68c5fe81ade109446a9f4c24e03290ec5493031f#portfolio-of-basic-crdts">this list</a> for a good overview. Some examples:</p><ul><li><strong>Grow-only set:</strong> This is a set of elements. The only type of update is to add something to the set. Adding something twice is a no-op, so you can determine the contents of the set by just applying all of the updates in any order.</li><li><strong>Last-writer-wins register:</strong> This is a container for a single value. Updates can be implemented as a new value, a timestamp, and a peer ID. You can determine the value of the register by just taking the value of the latest update (using the peer ID to break a tie).</li></ul><p>Figma isn&#39;t using true CRDTs though. CRDTs are designed for decentralized systems where there is no single central authority to decide what the final state should be. There is some unavoidable performance and memory overhead with doing this. Since Figma is centralized (our server is the central authority), we can simplify our system by removing this extra overhead and benefit from a faster and leaner implementation.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that Figma&#39;s data structure isn&#39;t a single CRDT. Instead it&#39;s inspired by multiple separate CRDTs and uses them in combination to create the final data structure that represents a Figma document (described below).</p><p>Even if you have a client-server setup, CRDTs are still worth researching because they provide a well-studied, solid foundation to start with. Understanding them helps build intuition on how to create a correct system. From that point, it&#39;s possible to relax some of the requirements of CRDTs based on the needs of the application as we have done.</p><h3 id="how-a-figma-document-is-structured"><a href="#how-a-figma-document-is-structured">How a Figma document is structured</a></h3><p>Ok, so we want to sync updates to Figma documents using CRDTs. What does the structure of a Figma document even look like?</p><p>Every Figma document is a tree of objects, similar to the HTML DOM. There is a single root object that represents the entire document. Underneath the root object are page objects, and underneath each page object is a hierarchy of objects representing the contents of the page. This tree is is presented in the layers panel on the left-hand side of the Figma editor.</p><p>Each object has an ID and a collection of properties with values. One way to think about this is by picturing the document as a two-level map: <code>Map&lt;ObjectID, Map&lt;Property, Value&gt;&gt;</code>. Another way to think about this is a database with rows that store <code>(ObjectID, Property, Value)</code> tuples. This means that adding new features to Figma usually just means adding new properties to objects.</p><h2 id="the-details-of-figma-s-multiplayer-system"><a href="#the-details-of-figma-s-multiplayer-system">The details of Figma’s multiplayer system</a></h2><p>For the rest of this post, we will talk about the details of Figma&#39;s multiplayer algorithm and how we solved some of the edge cases we encountered.</p><h3 id="syncing-object-properties"><a href="#syncing-object-properties">Syncing object properties</a></h3><p>Figma’s multiplayer servers keep track of the latest value that any client has sent for a given property on a given object. This means that two clients changing unrelated properties on the same object won’t conflict, and two clients changing the same property on unrelated objects also won’t conflict. A conflict happens when two clients change the same property on the same object, in which case the document will just end up with the last value that was sent to the server. This approach is similar to a last-writer-wins register in CRDT literature except we don’t need a timestamp because the server can define the order of events.</p><figure><figcaption>An animation showing two clients sending updates without any conflicts</figcaption></figure><p> <br/>An important consequence of this is that changes are atomic at the property value boundary. The eventually consistent value for a given property is always a value sent by one of the clients. This is why simultaneous editing of the same text value doesn’t work in Figma. If the text value is B and someone changes it to AB at the same time as someone else changes it to BC, the end result will be either AB or BC but never ABC. That’s ok with us because Figma is a design tool, not a text editor, and this use case isn’t one we’re optimizing for.</p><p>The most complicated part of this is how to handle conflicts on the client when there’s a conflicting change. Property changes on the client are always applied immediately instead of waiting for acknowledgement from the server since we want Figma to feel as responsive as possible. However, if we do this and we also apply every change from the server as it comes in, conflicting changes will sometimes &#34;flicker&#34; when older acknowledged values temporarily overwrite newer unacknowledged ones. We want to avoid this flickering behavior.</p><p>Intuitively, we want to show the user our best prediction of what the eventually-consistent value will be. Since our change we just sent hasn’t yet been acknowledged by the server but all changes coming from the server have been, our change is our best prediction because it’s the most recent change we know about in last-to-the-server order. So we want to discard incoming changes from the server that conflict with unacknowledged property changes.</p><figure><figcaption>An animation showing how to avoid “flickering” during a conflict between two clients</figcaption></figure><h3 id="syncing-object-creation-and-removal"><a href="#syncing-object-creation-and-removal">Syncing object creation and removal</a></h3><p>Creating a new object and removing an existing object are both explicit actions in our protocol. Objects cannot automatically be brought into existence by writing a property to an unassigned object ID. Removing an object deletes all data about it from the server including all of its properties.</p><p>Object creation in Figma is most similar to a last-writer-wins set in CRDT literature, where whether an object is in the set or not is just another last-writer-wins boolean property on that object. A big difference from this model is that Figma doesn’t store any properties of deleted objects on the server. That data is instead stored in the undo buffer of the client that performed the delete. If that client wants to undo the delete, then it’s also responsible for restoring all properties of the deleted objects. This helps keep long-lived documents from continuing to grow in size as they are edited.</p><p>This system relies on clients being able to generate new object IDs that are guaranteed to be unique. This can be easily accomplished by assigning every client a unique client ID and including that client ID as part of newly-created object IDs. That way no two clients will ever generate the same object ID. Note that we can’t solve this by having the server assign IDs to newly-created objects because object creation needs to be able to work offline.</p><h3 id="syncing-trees-of-objects"><a href="#syncing-trees-of-objects">Syncing trees of objects</a></h3><p>Arranging objects in an eventually-consistent tree structure is the most complicated part of our multiplayer system. The complexity comes from what to do about reparenting operations (moving an object from one parent to another). When designing the tree structure, we had two main goals in mind:</p><ul><li>Reparenting an object shouldn’t conflict with changes to unrelated properties on those objects. If someone is changing the object’s color while someone else is reparenting the object, those two operations should both succeed.</li><li>Two concurrent reparenting operations for the same object shouldn’t ever result in two copies of that object in separate places in the tree.</li></ul><p>Many approaches represent reparenting as deleting the object and recreating it somewhere else with a new ID, but that doesn&#39;t work for us because concurrent edits would be dropped when the object&#39;s identity changes. The approach we settled on was to represent the parent-child relationship by storing a link to the parent as a property on the child. That way object identity is preserved. We also don’t need to deal with the situation where an object somehow ends up with multiple parents that we might have if, say, we instead had each parent store links to its children.</p><p>However, we now have a new problem. Without any other restrictions, these parent links are just directed edges on a graph. There’s nothing to ensure that they have no cycles and form a valid tree. An example of this is a concurrent edit where one client makes A a child of B while another client makes B a child of A. Then A and B are both each other’s parent, which forms a cycle.</p><p>Figma’s multiplayer servers reject parent property updates that would cause a cycle, so this issue can’t happen on the server. But it can still happen on the client. Clients can’t reject changes from the server because the server is the ultimate authority on what the document looks like. So a client could end up in a state where it has both sent the server an unacknowledged change to parent A under B and also received a change from the server that parents B under A. The client’s change will be rejected in the future by the server because it will form a cycle, but the client doesn’t know it yet.</p><figure><figcaption>An animation of a reparenting conflict</figcaption></figure><p>Figma’s solution is to temporarily parent these objects to each other and remove them from the tree until the server rejects the client’s change and the object is reparented where it belongs. This solution isn’t great because the object temporarily disappears, but it’s a simple solution to a very rare temporary problem so we didn’t feel the need to try something more complicated here such as breaking these temporary cycles on the client.</p><p>To construct a tree we also need a way of determining the order of the children for a given parent. Figma uses a technique called “fractional indexing” to do this. At a high level, an object’s position in its parent’s array of children is represented as a fraction between 0 and 1 exclusive. The order of an object’s children is determined by sorting them by their positions. You can insert an object between two other objects by setting its position to the average of the positions of the two other objects.</p><figure><figcaption>An animation of reordering using fractional indexing</figcaption></figure><p>We’ve already written <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/realtime-editing-of-ordered-sequences/#fractional-indexing">another article</a> that describes this technique in detail. The important part to mention here is that the parent link and this position must both be stored as a single property so they update atomically. It doesn’t make sense to continue to use the position from one parent when the parent is updated to point somewhere else.</p><h2 id="implementing-undo"><a href="#implementing-undo">Implementing undo</a></h2><p>Undo history has a natural definition for single-player mode, but undo in a multiplayer environment is inherently confusing. If other people have edited the same objects that you edited and then undo, what should happen? Should your earlier edits be applied over their later edits? What about redo?</p><p>We had a lot of trouble until we settled on a principle to help guide us: if you undo a lot, copy something, and redo back to the present (a common operation), the document should not change. This may seem obvious but the single-player implementation of redo means “put back what I did” which may end up overwriting what other people did next if you’re not careful. This is why in Figma an undo operation modifies redo history at the time of the undo, and likewise a redo operation modifies undo history at the time of the redo.</p><figure><figcaption>An animation showing undo and redo history modification</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-big-takeaways"><a href="#the-big-takeaways">The big takeaways</a></h2><p>We&#39;ve covered a lot! This is the post we wished we could have read when we were first starting our research. It&#39;s one thing to learn about CRDTs in the abstract, but it&#39;s a different thing to find out how those ideas work in practice in a real production system.</p><p>Some of our main takeaways:</p><ul><li>CRDT literature can be relevant even if you&#39;re not creating a decentralized system</li><li>Multiplayer for a visual editor like ours wasn&#39;t as intimidating as we thought</li><li>Taking time to research and prototype in the beginning really paid off</li></ul><p>If you made it this far, you should now have enough information to make your own collaborative tree data structure. And even if your problem space isn&#39;t exactly like ours, I hope this post shows how CRDT research can be a great source of inspiration.</p><p>Do you love thinking about collaborative editing, distributed systems, or building scalable services? <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">We’re hiring</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bringing new life to Figma’s brand</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/bringing-new-life-to-figmas-brand/</link>
      <description>From typography to colors to illustration, the Figma brand has evolved.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A brand refresh is no small task. Especially when you’re a company that’s rooted in design—there’s an added pressure to get it right. For us to get it right, collaboration was a major theme. In fact, collaboration was the colorful thread that tied the whole process together. From the pushing-the-envelope brainstorms that involved our cross-functional teams, to the methodology behind the new illustrations, to the way we used Figma itself to bring our ideas to life. </p><p>Here’s how we landed on Figma’s new look and feel.</p><h2 id="evolving-figma-s-brand-language"><a href="#evolving-figma-s-brand-language">Evolving Figma’s brand language</a></h2><p>I joined Figma about a year ago with the goal to evolve the brand. Of course, I was familiar with Figma, but as I started dissecting the brand language under this lens, I realized there was a lot of great work that already existed. We didn’t need to start from scratch, we just needed to give Figma a longer runway than it currently had. The foundational brand language already had strong pillars conceptually and value-wise, but when they were established, Figma was a new and smaller company. We needed an expansive brand language that would match how much the company has grown. For example, we have a blog now. If a designer is working on a visual for the blog, what rules should the image follow? We took the limited brand guide that existed and added new pages and chapters. </p><p>For that reason, what you see in the refresh won’t feel like it’s out of left field. It’ll look and feel like it’s still orbiting the same sun because we took inspiration from what already existed and gave it new wings. We’re taking those original ideas and hitting different angles and points and dialing up certain things. Like the shapes, for example. They’ve always been a part of Figma’s brand, but with the refresh, we found new places they could live and new ways they could be used that still made sense. </p><h2 id="establishing-figma-s-personality"><a href="#establishing-figma-s-personality">Establishing Figma’s personality</a></h2><p>Before we designed anything, we started with a lot of research to nail down our strategy. In this process, it helped to think of Figma the brand as a living entity to better bring it to life in our minds. If Figma were a person, how does it walk and talk, and breathe and live? It might wear different clothes every day, but it still has a distinct style. Over the course of weeks, we put together a list of four guidepost personality words, but we included a few detail descriptors to clarify what we mean when we say that Figma is bold, for example.  </p><ul><li><strong>Curious</strong> — Clever, playful, imaginative. This is your friend with the far-out ideas. They always want to be learning more and considering the things that might not be obvious.</li><li><strong>Vibrant</strong> — Dynamic, confident, alive. Figma loves nerding out on certain topics and is proud of it.</li><li><strong>Honest</strong> — Inclusive, empathetic, approachable. We’re never afraid to admit that we don’t know everything, but together we can figure it out.</li><li><strong>Bold</strong> — Powerful, unexpected, non-conforming. We don’t live in the shoulds, we do what is right and true to us.</li></ul><p>We needed a brand that could flex between being reserved and also playful. One that can go from consumers to enterprise, and we felt the words above got us there.</p><h2 id="shapes-that-show-off-the-process"><a href="#shapes-that-show-off-the-process">Shapes that show off the process</a></h2><p>Some people might think we just made a bunch of fun new shapes, but there’s a clear methodology behind how they interact or collaborate with each other. We like to think about the shapes as people. People talking, working together, sometimes arguing, or just existing. The illustrations show that collaboration. Depending on how you position them, lots of harmonious compositions can be created. Of course, just like people, some shapes work well with others, while others do not. </p><p>There are different levels of illustration using the shapes depending on what the moment calls for. If it’s a place where someone is learning and needs absolute clarity, there are no abstract shapes. We include only the illustrations that are simple and straight-forward. </p><p>We want design to be more accessible to people, so a lot of our shapes are very simple. They might come together to form something complicated, but they distill down into basic shapes. In the illustrations, we sometimes show that process — how the shape is built. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8564c617572ea295263a6ef5a8d442eee83c980b-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8564c617572ea295263a6ef5a8d442eee83c980b-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8564c617572ea295263a6ef5a8d442eee83c980b-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8564c617572ea295263a6ef5a8d442eee83c980b-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8564c617572ea295263a6ef5a8d442eee83c980b-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>We also wanted the illustrations to feel like they’re still in process. In design, there can be a tendency to share only when it’s complete and perfect. But we wanted to highlight the work that goes into making — it’s often messy, imperfect, changing all the time just like people are. We felt that this realness, this aliveness helped dial up Figma’s vibrancy. You’ll see in the illustrations that at least one element is being manipulated or edited. Nothing feels quite like it’s perfect or complete. We wanted to encourage people to highlight their mess and share how they create. Maybe that way, someone else can learn from your process. </p><h2 id="a-typography-with-a-few-quirks"><a href="#a-typography-with-a-few-quirks">A typography with a few quirks</a></h2><p>In the search for a new brand typeface, a designer on our team came across one called Whyte from Swiss foundry <a href="https://www.abcdinamo.com/front">Dinamo</a>. At first glance, Whyte looks pretty normal, and then you look closer and you start to notice some oddities. Whyte actually comes in two different versions—standard and inktrap. We fell in love with the inktrap version because it references ink traps in design history. Historically, when people were using metal plates to manually print, ink traps were cut in to create a place for the ink to pool. At smaller sizes, it’s difficult to see, but when you blow the letters up, you can clearly see the notches. We loved it because that characteristic adds an illustrative element to the type itself and we actually wanted to highlight this part of the type’s design that is usually invisible. Whyte spoke to what we wanted to achieve — a seamless flex between nonconforming and reserved. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40748b8a27d4f6377c7efffe9c66f6f64fe4153c-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40748b8a27d4f6377c7efffe9c66f6f64fe4153c-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40748b8a27d4f6377c7efffe9c66f6f64fe4153c-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40748b8a27d4f6377c7efffe9c66f6f64fe4153c-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40748b8a27d4f6377c7efffe9c66f6f64fe4153c-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="using-figma-to-refresh-figma"><a href="#using-figma-to-refresh-figma">Using Figma to refresh Figma</a></h2><p>We worked exclusively in Figma for the refresh, which was a stretch to our creative muscles since we grew up doing this type of work in Photoshop and Illustrator. We had to come up with new ways to do things. But because we were already thinking creatively, it led us to some celebratory moments where we took an idea even further because of something Figma allowed us to do. Collaboration was a huge part of that. This wasn’t a project where we could or should divide and conquer. We needed to work together, and often, that meant simultaneously. That’s something we could only do in Figma. Whether it was through the process itself, or the illustrations we were creating, we wanted to find ways to demonstrate Figma’s power. For that reason, we hope that the refresh is a testament to what Figma can do.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/247ad473fc2889e8a29bc3391e042807a60e0a21-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/247ad473fc2889e8a29bc3391e042807a60e0a21-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/247ad473fc2889e8a29bc3391e042807a60e0a21-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/247ad473fc2889e8a29bc3391e042807a60e0a21-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/247ad473fc2889e8a29bc3391e042807a60e0a21-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>See the refresh in action.

      <title>Customer journey mapping with Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/customer-journey-mapping-with-figma/</link>
      <description>Learn how to create interactive customer journey maps with Figma</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For many designers, Figma is the tool of choice for creating digital interfaces from web sites to mobile apps. However, Figma is also incredibly useful for user experience research. In fact, the first project I ever completed in Figma was a customer journey map. </p><p>My company, <a href="https://www.lextech.com">Lextech</a> is based in Chicago, Ill., and has a distributed worldwide workforce of talented technology leaders, engineers, and experience designers. Nearly all of our designers are cross-functional, so they’re comfortable doing research and design. </p><p>A lot of our focus is spent on improving Fortune 500 customer and employee experiences by analyzing critical workflows in life sciences, aviation, and finance. How do pilots prepare for a flight? How do patients interact with health care professionals? How can financial service representatives better engage customers at a bank?</p><p>In many cases, the best way to understand a workflow and collaborate on finding solutions is to create a journey map. The years our design team has spent researching, interviewing, and building those maps taught us a lot about building great customer journey maps – and also how to leverage Figma’s features to deliver it effectively to others.</p><p>A single customer journey map isn’t always the best way to explain a process. If a process is not linear or has many branches or dependencies, you might choose a more traditional two-dimensional user flow diagram. Or if the process is already well documented via other visual means, a customer journey map might not be as valuable. </p><h2 id="why-map"><a href="#why-map">Why map?</a></h2><p>When researched correctly and designed elegantly, customer journey maps are incredibly helpful in creating a shared understanding of a customer process, such as shopping for a car or buying a product from a web site. The customer journey map serves as a visual storytelling aid that clearly explains each step in that process, and often, a level of emotion or pain that the customer faces during each step.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?rect=0,0,1280,779&amp;w=670&amp;h=408&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f227564c66ebdce6f9f1912890a505b2fc8e322-1280x780.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1280w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Example of how to capture in a customer journey map</figcaption></figure><p>By looking at the same map, people with different viewpoints can easily digest the research that went into building it, and identify places where that process can be improved.</p><h2 id="how-figma-makes-it-easy-to-build-journey-maps"><a href="#how-figma-makes-it-easy-to-build-journey-maps">How Figma makes it easy to build journey maps</a></h2><p>We’ve created numerous journey maps in Figma over the past two years, and in that time, we’ve learned a lot about how Figma can improve both our research and design processes. Here’s how our user experience researchers and visual designers have used Figma’s unique features to turn ordinary customer journey maps into extraordinary ones.</p><h4 id="a-journey-map-component-library"><a href="#a-journey-map-component-library">A journey map component library</a></h4><p>By creating your own team library of journey map components and styles, you can bring a level of consistency to your design and make it easy to build out new maps quickly. When style changes need to be made, it’s as simple as updating a component. We’ve created a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/TIgdMsi93xMZzSH9ynF5pY/CX-Journey-Map-Template-For-Public/duplicate">Figma sample file and component library</a> that includes some components you might want to consider for your journey maps. You can also check out Figma’s <a href="https://www.figma.com/templates/customer-journey-mapping/">customer journey map template</a>.</p><h4 id="tidy-up-command"><a href="#tidy-up-command">Tidy Up command</a></h4><p>The <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/189-smart-selection#tidy">Tidy Up</a> feature has multiple benefits. It can be used to easily modify the spacing between map steps. It can also be used to insert and/or reorder steps without significant reworking of the map.</p><figure></figure><h4 id="real-time-collaboration"><a href="#real-time-collaboration">Real-time collaboration</a></h4><p>In addition to the obvious benefit of having multiple designers work on the journey map at the same time, our team has also experimented with using Figma to take interview notes directly in the tool. This approach keeps all our interviews and notes in one central location, rather than in multiple tools.</p><h4 id="version-history"><a href="#version-history">Version history</a></h4><p>Before we deliver a version of our journey map for client review, we manually timestamp a version in our history file, just in case we need to refer to it later on in the project. Sometimes, it’s helpful to show a client how the map evolved over time as we learned more about the customer.</p><p>We make it a habit to share rough versions of our customer journey maps with actual customers. That allows us to see if they agree with our research findings and whether there are any crucial steps we may have overlooked. The <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/44-comments">comment tool</a> is a great way to request and collect that feedback to ensure a single source of truth.   </p><p>For example, we recently shared a journey map with a user group that frequently travels by air, to ask them how their personal experiences differed from the journey we documented. Their feedback helped us uncover new areas to explore and where we could guide future research activities.</p><p>Our practice at Lextech is to duplicate the Figma file and then share the map as a single-screen prototype, then invite one or more users into the file and add comments asynchronously. One benefit of this approach is that we are able to respond in Figma to ask follow-up questions in the comment thread.</p><p>Other times, when reviewing the map on a conference call or in person, we’ll have a designer type in feedback from all participants via direct comments into the file. In both cases, the exact placement of these comments ensures that when they’re reviewed later, we’ll know exactly where in the journey that feedback was given.</p><p>In some cases, we’ll create multiple copies of the same Figma file, so that feedback isn’t “poisoned” by previous comments. This ensures that each set of new eyes sees an unbiased view of the journey map, plus, it also helps us organize feedback by source. For instance, it’s sometimes helpful to see whether journey map feedback from customers matches that from the client, to see what differences may exist.</p><h4 id="make-your-journey-map-interactive"><a href="#make-your-journey-map-interactive">Make your journey map interactive</a></h4><p>Even if you only plan to share your customer journey map as a printed document, consider adding navigational hotspots. In our sample file, we not only created a printed version with all the phases combined, but also one with a main navigation menu and links to each phase. </p><p>During one project, we had so many great customer quotes that we couldn’t fit them all in the print version of the map. In the digital version, we offered viewers a way to tap the map to read those extra quotes.</p><p>In the sample interactive journey map, if you tap on one of the happy or sad faces, you’ll get a popover that explains the grading scale a bit more. This helps reduce the amount of data you actually need to place on the screen, to make the key content more obvious.</p><p>In the end, the best customer journey maps are not created once and forgotten, but are continually reviewed and revised – just like a digital product. As your experience research teams learn more about customers, you might find yourself adding new steps into the journey, or revising existing ones to be more accurate. Thinking of your journey map as an iterative learning tool is the best way to stay continuously connected to your customers.

      <title>Designing for top feature requests, like Smart Animate</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-smart-animate-and-advanced-transitions/</link>
      <description>Introducing Smart Animate and Drag, new prototyping features that will open the door to new transition possibilities in Figma.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we’re introducing new prototyping features that will open the door to new transition possibilities in Figma. They’ll help bring more of your interaction design ideas to life:</p><ul><li>Smart Animate, a new transition type that automatically animates similar objects and improves existing transitions</li><li>Drag, a new interaction type that lets users control a transition with a drag of their finger</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Id4INKEwb8">Watch this product tutorial</a> to get all the details and learn how to get started, or check out this <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/365-smart-animate">help article</a>.</p><p>Features to help achieve advanced transitions like Smart Animate and Drag have been on our minds for a while. They’ve been on our customers’ minds for even longer. If you’re a fellow designer or someone who works closely with design teams, you’re probably all too familiar with the challenges of designing for a highly requested customer feature, one where users may have pre-existing expectations for how it might work. <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/announcing-smart-animate-and-advanced-transitions/#find-the-figma-way-or-your-way">Click ahead</a> to dig into the features and see real examples of Smart Animate in action. Or continue reading to see how we designed Smart Animate… </p><p>As we kicked off design discovery for our first release of Smart Animate, we began to look for answers starting from a familiar place—our users. </p><h2 id="understand-users-who-are-experiencing-pain"><a href="#understand-users-who-are-experiencing-pain">Understand users who are experiencing pain</a></h2><p>When working on a hard design problem, talking to users is always a great start and you don’t have to be a big company to set up systematic ways to do qualitative user research. One of the ways we continuously gather feedback is through in-product NPS surveys. (Surprise! We do read the comments and take action.) Our support team replies to many responses directly, but we also categorize the NPS comments into meaningful groupings. This makes it easy to keep a pulse on specific topics and can serve as a starting point for user feedback when we’re ready to kickstart design for a new feature.</p><p>Here are some things we heard about prototyping in Figma...</p><div><blockquote><p>Speaking of animations, I would love simple things like dropdown lists, buttons hovers, varied and smooth appearance of pop-ups, switching tabs, and so on. It is not about complex animation…&#34;  </p><p>&#34;When I am designing screens where animation plays a big part in the experience, we need other tools to show what we want from our developers. E.g. a click shows an advanced transition from one screen to another. I would like to not use another tool for my creations.&#34;  </p><p>&#34;I was wondering if you plan to add more prototype transitions? It would be nice to have an auto-animate as well as a drag/slide transition.  </p></blockquote></div><p>The value of the NPS surveys does not lie in the score. For us, it’s in having an open feedback channel where we can hear from customers who are experiencing “pain”. We’re able to talk to them directly to get ideas on what features they’re looking for and understand what they like and don’t like about how they animate prototypes today inside and outside of Figma.</p><p>Fun fact: Many of these NPS survey respondents became our first beta customers. Special shoutout and thank you to all of them!</p><h2 id="zoom-out-to-uncover-patterns-across-use-cases"><a href="#zoom-out-to-uncover-patterns-across-use-cases">Zoom out to uncover patterns across use cases</a></h2><p>Because a feature like Smart Animate needs to support a variety of use cases, we can’t just design Smart Animate with one specific use case in mind. Otherwise, it’ll be too limiting and not useful for the majority of our users. To make sure that what we design can scale for a multitude of use cases, we had to zoom out and search for common design patterns. </p><p>We gathered all the animation examples we could find through our conversations with customers. We also did our own research into interactive interfaces we use in our daily lives. Then we explored how someone would prototype this in Figma and what challenges they would face when doing so. </p><p>This process led us to two major patterns that you’ll see in today’s first release of Smart Animate.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Pattern #1: An object appears, disappears, or changes while the user stays on the same screen</strong>You probably see this pattern everyday, like when you hover over a video and the playbar appears, when you hover over a navigation item and a dropdown expands, or when you swipe an object away and new content emerges from underneath.</p><p><strong>Pattern #2: Several UI elements stay fixed while the majority of the content on the user’s screen changes</strong>You’ll find this common pattern in a tabbed navigation. This slightly more complex animation appears when you drag content left or right and the tab bar indicator moves in the opposite direction.</p><p>Upleveling beyond individual use cases allowed us to focus on common denominators. Pinning down these two patterns helped us keep the feature scope focused while still addressing many of our customers’ use cases.</p><h2 id="find-the-figma-way-or-your-way"><a href="#find-the-figma-way-or-your-way">Find the Figma way (or your way)</a></h2><p>We’re not the only ones trying to solve these design challenges for our customers. However, we wanted our implementation of the solution to ‘feel’ like Figma. That meant making sure Smart Animate and Drag felt well-integrated with existing prototyping features. Sometimes, building new features requires a re-examination of what’s currently there. </p><p>First at the most fundamental level, we wanted the auto-animation of layers to work out-of-the-box as best as possible. So we revisited the basics, like layer naming. We didn’t want to completely reinvent the wheel, but this seemingly small update took countless hours to get right. I’ll spare you all the details, but essentially we updated how we automatically name and rename objects on creation or duplication, so layers that match up based on hierarchy, naming, and order will auto-animate. Additionally, in cases where something wouldn’t work, we wanted to make debugging of that situation a lot easier! That’s why you’ll get visual feedback on hover and selection to quickly check if layers match up correctly. Now when you hover over the layer you’re trying to animate, you’ll see every matching counterpart on other frames.</p><figure></figure><p>The other thing we wanted to make sure we got right is enabling users to combine the new Smart Animate transition with existing transitions. For transitions you already use today like Push, Move, or Slide, you’ll now see an additional setting called “Smart Animate Matching Layers”. This automatically detects matching layers between two screens and animates them separately from the other objects. This little checkbox enables you to build more complex animations, faster, while minimizing the number of duplicative layers you previously needed to create to express such an animation. </p><p>For us, designing new features also means making sure the new additions work seamlessly alongside existing features and doesn’t add unnecessary product complexity. It’s not just about building more new stuff; it’s also about making sure the stuff that’s already there still works great and continues to support new capabilities. </p><h2 id="prototype-examples-to-help-you-get-started"><a href="#prototype-examples-to-help-you-get-started">Prototype examples to help you get started</a></h2><p>Now to help inspire ideas and give you a few real examples, our team got together to create a bunch of new animated prototypes you can view and duplicate.

      <title>An update on plugin security</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/an-update-on-plugin-security/</link>
      <description>Learn about Figma&#39;s response to the security vulnerabilities that were reported in a 3rd-party library that we use for plugin security</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We recently <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-plugins/">launched Figma plugins</a>, the next phase of our platform efforts. As those of you who read our <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/">engineering blog post</a> know, we did a lot of research to figure out how to safely run 3rd-party code on figma.com. We eventually settled on a technology called the <a href="https://github.com/agoric/realms-shim/">Realms shim</a> to do this.</p><p>A little over two weeks ago, several independent vulnerabilities were recently discovered with the Realms shim that could have allowed code inside the sandbox to escape. We promptly fixed the vulnerabilities, and after auditing all published Figma plugins we have no evidence that the vulnerabilities were ever exploited by a Figma plugin. We then went further and made a fundamental change to our technology stack to help prevent this type of vulnerability from happening again in the future. Please read the remainder of this post for more details.</p><h2 id="background"><a href="#background">Background</a></h2><p>Before we talk about the vulnerabilities, it’s useful to have background on the security principles of Figma plugins.</p><p>Figma seeks to ensure that plugins <strong>can</strong>:</p><ul><li>Only be run by an explicit user action</li><li>Show UI in a single plugin-specific dialog</li><li>Read any data in your Figma document (e.g. a “find layer by name” plugin)</li><li>Modify any data in your Figma document (e.g. a “rename selected layers” plugin)</li><li>Communicate with any server over the internet (e.g. an “import from service X” plugin)</li></ul><p>Figma seeks to ensure that plugins <strong>can’t</strong>:</p><ul><li>Run by themselves</li><li>Get information about the project or team that owns the file</li><li>Access anything when they aren’t running</li><li>Access data from any files other than the file they were run in</li><li>Change Figma’s UI outside of the plugin UI dialog</li></ul><p>Figma&#39;s <a href="https://www.figma.com/organization/">Organization tier</a> has an additional security feature: administrators can configure a whitelist of plugins that are allowed inside the organization. This can be used to prevent untrusted plugins from being run in any file in that organization.</p><h2 id="figma-s-response"><a href="#figma-s-response">Figma’s response</a></h2><p>There were two rounds of vulnerability disclosures, one published as a public GitHub issue and the rest published as a private GitHub security advisory. Please refer to <a href="https://agoric.com/realms-shim-security-updates/">this blog post</a>. Had these vulnerabilities been exploited, the restrictions that Figma puts on plugins (described above) could have been bypassed.</p><p>Agoric, the team that makes the Realms shim, promptly notified us once the first vulnerability was disclosed and worked closely with us and with other companies that use the Realms shim to make sure the fixes were rolled out responsibly to minimize risk. All fixes have now finished rolling out and all details about the vulnerabilities have now been made public.</p><p>To ensure the security of our users, the main actions we took were to:  </p><ul><li>Disable publishing of new plugin code until the incident was fully resolved</li><li>Apply the patch to the known public vulnerability as soon as possible</li><li>Coordinate with Agoric and other affected parties about a public disclosure timeline</li><li>Make a technology change (described in the next section) that avoided the privately-disclosed vulnerabilities</li></ul><p>First, we prevented new plugins from being published to the community hub. We can do that by simply halting plugin reviews, since all new Figma plugins have to be manually reviewed and approved by us before they appear in the community hub for people to install. It&#39;s worth noting that our manual review process is about plugin user experience. We do not rely on human reviews to audit newly-published plugins for security as audits can produce false negatives. We instead use a sandbox to enforce a security boundary.</p><p>We also completely disabled publishing updates to existing plugins. This ensures that if a plugin developer with existing plugins was aware of a vulnerability, they could not exploit it. This was especially important as plugin code in Figma is live, which means updates to existing plugins instantly propagate to all open clients.  </p><p>The first vulnerability was published as a public GitHub issue, and therefore needed to be patched immediately. Fortunately, Agoric moved fast and had a fix on the same day. We applied the fix to Figma’s copy of the Realms shim and it went out with the next deploy.</p><p>The remaining vulnerabilities were disclosed in a private GitHub security advisory that only a few affected parties had access to. We were able to deploy a solution to those the following week. However, we waited before talking about the vulnerability publicly. With security advisories, the standard practice is to set a public disclosure date that gives enough time for affected parties to apply the patch while also acting as a deadline to make sure the vulnerability is patched promptly.</p><p>As such, we worked with Agoric to ensure that these issues remained private until after we had fully rolled out our fixes. We also did an audit of published plugin code and discovered no evidence that these vulnerabilities had ever been exploited by a Figma plugin.</p><h2 id="a-technology-change"><a href="#a-technology-change">A technology change</a></h2><p>The biggest change we made while responding to this incident was to change the way we run JavaScript code in plugins. We no longer use the Realms shim at all. We now use <a href="https://bellard.org/quickjs/">QuickJS</a>, a JavaScript VM written in C and cross-compiled to WebAssembly. This was our backup plan in case the Realms shim approach didn&#39;t work out. We were able to activate our backup plan very quickly thanks to a swappable architecture.</p><p>All vulnerabilities that were discovered with the Realms shim during this incident are no longer possible with our new implementation. This specific class of issues involve the Realms shim confusing an object from outside the sandbox with an object from inside the sandbox or vice versa. This is possible because the Realms shim uses the same JavaScript VM for all code both inside and outside the sandbox. Now that we&#39;re using a JavaScript VM compiled to WebAssembly, it&#39;s not possible to confuse objects from outside with objects from inside because the object representations are too different.</p><p>Why did we originally pick the Realms shim for Figma plugins? The Realms shim provides great performance and makes debugging Figma plugins really easy with minimal work on Figma&#39;s part. Code running inside the Realms shim still uses the browser&#39;s JavaScript VM so it runs just as fast as normal JavaScript. And the browser&#39;s built-in debugger can debug plugins in the Realms shim with the same rich development experience that all web developers are used to.</p><p>Why have we decided to keep using our backup plan, even though all vulnerabilities in the Realms shim have been fixed? We&#39;re actually very happy with the fact that we can switch back and forth between a Realms-based security model and a VM-based security model, but it comes at a cost. It is disruptive to us, and more importantly, disruptive to our developers. For now, it feels like the right call is to stick with the VM-based approach, which is somewhat slower for certain plugins, but intrinsically more secure. As Realms matures and evolves, we will always be able to switch back when the time is right.</p><h2 id="the-timeline"><a href="#the-timeline">The timeline</a></h2><p>Saturday, Sept 14th:    - The first vulnerability was disclosed on a GitHub issue    - Figma stopped approving new plugins </p><p>Monday, Sept 16th:    - Figma began working on the new WebAssembly JavaScript runtime    - A GitHub security advisory thread containing the remaining    vulnerabilities was started    </p><p>Tuesday, Sept 17th:    - Figma deployed the patch for the first vulnerability  </p><p>Wednesday, Sept 18th:    - Figma disabled publishing updates to existing plugins  </p><p>Wednesday, Sept 25th:    - Figma shipped the new WebAssembly JavaScript runtime    - Figma re-enabled plugin publishing    - Figma did an audit of published plugin code and discovered no evidence that these vulnerabilities had been exploited by a Figma plugin  </p><p>Wednesday, October 2nd:    - Agoric made all vulnerabilities public    - This post was published</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How a designer makes background patterns to push her creativity</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-a-designer-makes-background-patterns-to-push-her-creativity/</link>
      <description>How designer Namika Hamasaki became a pattern maker through a daily design challenge</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We came across Namika Hamasaki&#39;s work on her Dribbble <a href="https://dribbble.com/haiji505">portfolio</a> while collecting inspiration from daily UI challenges. Designers are attracted to daily UI challenges because they provide a creative exercise without the constraints of client or management expectations. While the idea and practice of daily UI challenges aren’t new, they often focus on common UI elements like sign up forms or mobile apps. So when we discovered Namika’s daily pattern challenge, it stood out as unique. Her approach around creating patterns was unusual too. She uses atypical color palettes and geometric shapes to create patterns with a distinct look and feel. We reached out to learn more about Namika and her process of creating patterns in Figma. And, keep reading to watch a video that shows how Namika brings her patterns to life. Here is what she had to say, as well as a video of her work in action:</p><figure></figure><h2 id="look-for-daily-inspiration"><a href="#look-for-daily-inspiration">Look for daily inspiration</a></h2><p>I love making patterns. So much so, that recently, I challenged myself to create a new pattern every day. While the definition of pattern is “a repeated decorative design,” none of my daily designs look the same. Because of that, people often ask me how I find inspiration, especially when I’m creating something new every day. But really, it’s not that difficult. I tell them to look around. There’s inspiration around every corner of life. If you keep your eyes open, you’ll soon notice unique details in food, <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6118484-Daily-Pattern-020">architecture</a>, <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6028782-Daily-Pattern-010-Furniture">furniture</a>, <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/5994983-Daily-Pattern-004-Pebble">nature</a>, on <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/6105585-Daily-Pattern-018-Landscape">your walk to work</a> — inspiration is everywhere. Once you start picking up on those little details, it’s easy to translate them into whatever you’re working on, which for me, is patterns. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ec1a45d6977f246b35a67fa012c28f7be1c658c-1340x400.png?w=670&amp;h=200&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ec1a45d6977f246b35a67fa012c28f7be1c658c-1340x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ec1a45d6977f246b35a67fa012c28f7be1c658c-1340x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ec1a45d6977f246b35a67fa012c28f7be1c658c-1340x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ec1a45d6977f246b35a67fa012c28f7be1c658c-1340x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9ec1a45d6977f246b35a67fa012c28f7be1c658c-1340x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>I come across so many ideas that I want to make sure I keep track of all of them. Whenever something catches my eye, whether it’s shapes or colors or composition, I take a photograph to reference later as I’m sitting down to design. This habit also ensures I’ve got a library of starting points so that I’m never facing the dreaded blank page. </p><h2 id="create-your-color-palette"><a href="#create-your-color-palette">Create your color palette</a></h2><p>This pattern challenge was a great excuse to try new color combinations I was interested in but hadn’t had the chance to use in other work. At work, I&#39;m often restricted to brand color palettes, so for this challenge, I decided to get far outside of the box with my color choices. I’ll often look to photographs for ideas, and once I find an image that inspires me, I use this <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/731841207668879837/Image-Palette/">Figma image palette plugin</a> to extract colors from my photos and generate a color palette. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d61adc3e963c574cc9d8910a7271c46be4816a16-1340x856.png?w=670&amp;h=428&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d61adc3e963c574cc9d8910a7271c46be4816a16-1340x856.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d61adc3e963c574cc9d8910a7271c46be4816a16-1340x856.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d61adc3e963c574cc9d8910a7271c46be4816a16-1340x856.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d61adc3e963c574cc9d8910a7271c46be4816a16-1340x856.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d61adc3e963c574cc9d8910a7271c46be4816a16-1340x856.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="make-a-grid"><a href="#make-a-grid">Make a grid</a></h2><p>Once my color palette is figured out, I move onto the next step in my process, which is to set up my grid. This is especially important when you’re working with patterns because you want to make sure your pattern repeats correctly and that you can organize your pattern elements easily. With Figma, I can quickly set up my preferred grid <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-layout-grids-in-figma/">using Layout grid</a>. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e4fc045431b3559efed28a3c7f693e6379c66fd1-669x428.png?rect=0,0,668,428&amp;w=670&amp;h=429&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e4fc045431b3559efed28a3c7f693e6379c66fd1-669x428.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e4fc045431b3559efed28a3c7f693e6379c66fd1-669x428.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e4fc045431b3559efed28a3c7f693e6379c66fd1-669x428.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 668w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="play-around-with-shapes"><a href="#play-around-with-shapes">Play around with shapes</a></h2><p>Now it’s time to have some fun! When I first started the daily pattern challenge, I was drawing my patterns by hand but switched to digital when I became interested in composing patterns using basic geometric shapes. By the end of my pattern designing process, some of the patterns look quite complicated, but they started out as simple shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles that I strategically placed on my grid. Though I start with the basics, I play around with the shapes to see how different approaches yield different visual results. </p><p>For example, I might make a circle and then rotate it by 45 degrees to see how that feels. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?rect=0,0,1199,537&amp;w=670&amp;h=300&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d9608f147aaba1c2222bb1350130c82dd04a4365-1200x537.gif?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1199w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Or maybe I’ll get a little more adventurous and play with rotating each semi-circle by a different angle.

      <title>An ode to OpenType: Fall in love with the secret world of fonts</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/opentype-font-features/</link>
      <description>In Figma you can now turn on additional ligatures, customize the style of digits, switch to alternative letterforms, and make use of adjustments available in many of today’s fonts.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Starting today, Figma will support OpenType features of all the fonts you use: local fonts, Google Fonts, and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-organization/#shared-fonts-simplifies-onboarding">fonts shared inside organizations</a>. This will allow you to turn on additional ligatures, customize the style of digits, switch to alternative letterforms, and make use of adjustments available in many of today’s fonts — through a user interface that will make discovering them as much fun as using them.</p><p>If you’re in a hurry, you can jump to the <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/opentype-font-features/#introducing-opentype-features-in-figma">description of the new functionality</a> in Figma. But if you’d prefer a deeper introduction to the world of OpenType, read on for the tale of one designer’s love affair with it.</p><h2 id="the-mysterious-double-life-of-warnock-pro"><a href="#the-mysterious-double-life-of-warnock-pro">The mysterious double life of Warnock Pro</a></h2><p>I remember exactly when and where I was when I discovered fonts have secrets. It happened many years ago, during one beautiful Amsterdam spring, in a small room at the Vrije Universiteit. I was working on my doctoral thesis, but things weren’t going very well. So, I did what I often do when the creative side of my brain becomes restless: I turned to typography.</p><p>I explored the university’s directory of fonts, and dove into the PDF instruction manual of Warnock Pro, one of my favorites. I’d used it before and thought I knew it well, but that day I learned it had been living a mysterious double life. The PDF explained Warnock Pro was more than it appeared: True connoisseurs of the font could move past its basic look and customize the <em>character</em> of its characters.</p><p>The options went beyond — far beyond — the standard bold and italic. The first thing I noticed were new number styles, named “old-style figures” and “tabular figures.” These were digits of different shapes and positions, meant to blend better than Warnock Pro’s default digits when used within text, or inside tables:</p><figure></figure><p>In addition to lowercase and uppercase, there was also a different, in-between style called “small caps” — meant “to introduce the first few words at the beginning of a story, or to highlight key words within text”:</p><figure></figure><p>I also learned that many of the letters came with hidden alternative versions, which — as the PDF explained — “have an ending flourish and could be used at the end of a word or phrase as a design embellishment”:</p><figure></figure><p>There was a section called “ordinals,” explaining that Warnock Pro came equipped with beautiful fractions, and what in time would become one of my favorite glyphs ever: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numero_sign">numero</a>:</p><figure></figure><p>There were also “stylistic alternates,” slightly different versions of a few characters:</p><figure></figure><p>And, right next door, “ornaments,” a way to turn the aforementioned letters into all sorts of gorgeous symbols:</p><figure></figure><p>The list seemed endless, and I felt overwhelmed; the typeface I thought I knew had so much more to offer than I’d realized. The swashes, the ornaments, the extra digits — I still didn’t quite understand what many of these were <em>for,</em> but I wanted to use them anyway. </p><p>After a little digging, there came another shock: Warnock Pro’s secrets were accessible in some design tools I was already using! The options were bundled under an obscure technical term called “OpenType features,” hidden inside submenus, filled with checkmarks attached to scary-sounding names. It was no wonder I’d never stumbled upon them before. </p><p>In the weeks to follow I became intoxicated with OpenType. I discovered that a few other fonts also contained these features, and I filled my thesis to the brim with them. </p><p>I was like a cook discovering the world’s spices for the first time. Why had no one told me about the existence of typographic paprika, coriander, cumin, and thyme? I’d been working with plain old salt and pepper, when Warnock Pro and other fonts had an endless number of more interesting seasonings. </p><p>Predictably, I went overboard, applying the spices bluntly and indiscriminately. I added swashes to my chapter titles, peppered in a few different types of digits, and even snuck in an ornament or two. To top it all, I added an extra section to my thesis titled “A note on typography.” Even there, I set the first two words in small caps, and wrote out the year in old-style digits.</p><p>But clumsy as it all was, it also felt profound: I wanted to share what I’d learned with the world. This was, as far as I can remember, my first public declaration of love for typography — and OpenType features were what led me there.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670&amp;h=369&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afa877a49395cd5fe99c3fa8933619743d058a22-1340x738.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="the-adolescent-years-with-opentype"><a href="#the-adolescent-years-with-opentype">The adolescent years with OpenType</a></h2><p>Over the next few years, I made sure to open every PDF that came with a font, and inspect all the OpenType secrets hiding inside.</p><p>As time passed, more and more fonts came equipped with special seasoning options. And, in time, online type specimen pages replaced PDFs as the method for communicating them (here’s an example from a font I like a lot, although <a href="https://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/cms/fonts/marcin-typewriter?page=3">I cannot quite explain why</a>). </p><p>Through these specimen pages, I learned that not all fonts were made equal. Some came with just a singular option that changed only one character. Other times, a font would have dozens of OpenType features, each affecting the entire character set. In those cases, enabling the feature meant watching a font transform in front of my eyes, morphing into what felt like an entirely new typeface.</p><p>Months turned into years, and my knowledge of OpenType accumulated. I came to learn the meaning of specific technical terms, like “tabular numbers” (numbers meant to be put in tables) or “discretionary ligatures” (as in: to be used at your discretion). After even more time, I started understanding the meaning of <em>features themselves</em>: rather than enabling them simply because I could, I paid closer attention to what problems they were supposed to solve.</p><p>One example: Just a few years ago, when I was working at Medium, we spent time figuring out how to choose the right digits for all the articles on the platform. In body text, we tried to make them as unexciting as possible, flowing well with sentences around them. For the rare pull quotes, however, we decided to do the opposite, going for headline-like digits, and a flamboyant ampersand — all hiding inside OpenType features of a font named Kievit:</p><figure></figure><p>Around the same time, poster designers I worked with taught me about another important OpenType feature. It turned out many fonts came with a set of slightly adjusted and re-aligned symbols and punctuation, to be used when writing exclusively in all caps, crucial in making everything feel better and more cohesive together:</p><figure></figure><p>And even recently at Figma, the <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-new-finger-tips/">keyboard shortcuts panel</a> I helped build used some OpenType features of Inter, to make it easier for the users to distinguish letterforms that otherwise could look too similar:</p><figure></figure><p>Over and over again, whether I used typography in service of print, user interfaces, or graphic design, it continued to surprise me how often small differences like these mattered — how often the fonts and typography choices felt <em>almost</em> there, but just a letterform or two away from the entire project coming together.</p><p>OpenType features frequently helped find the right letterforms and save the day. From a distance, many of them appeared trivial and disposable — but just like seasoning, they became something no typographic dish could really live without. Sometimes one feature was as simple as a pinch of salt on watermelon, or nutmeg added to sautéed kale: undetectable as its own flavor, but in combination with the right ingredient, arriving at something enriching, deep, magical. The other times, it was something huge, weird, and suspect that worked surprisingly well — like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/05/well/eat/farmers-market-shopping-with-the-chef-tom-colicchio.html">chamomile and fish</a>, or pepperoni pizza with honey.</p><h2 id="introducing-opentype-features-in-figma"><a href="#introducing-opentype-features-in-figma">Introducing OpenType features in Figma</a></h2><p>Given my history with OpenType features, it’s not surprising that supporting OpenType features was my first Figma project. I proposed the idea even before officially joining, as a guest during one of the company’s Maker Weeks. (Lucky for me, the Figma team also agreed it was important to make OpenType features more accessible to our customers).</p><p>It felt important to me. The features held a special place in my heart, found at that treasured intersection of “playfulness” and “usability.” They traveled with me throughout my design career – I used OpenType features when teaching typography workshops at Google, fought for them at Medium, and enabled them in government projects at Code for America. I wanted others to discover and experience them, too – and to make that process as easy and friendly as possible.</p><p>Today, I’m happy to announce Figma will support OpenType features in any font you use. Click on the three dots in the Type section, and you will see a new panel that gives you access to your font’s secrets:</p><figure></figure><p>We wanted to remove some of the challenges of going through PDFs and specimen websites, but without dumbing things down. It took us some time to arrive at the right balance. Here&#39;s what makes our implementation unique:    </p><ul><li><strong>Panel name.</strong> We do not call the panel “OpenType features,” since that’s such a highly technical term (not to mention it could be confusing, as OpenType format and OpenType features are two different things).</li><li><strong>Grouping and labels.</strong> Things are grouped in ways relevant to how people use Figma (for example, we moved case-sensitive forms up, and scientific inferiors down), and where we could, we chose to use friendly and understandable labels instead of jargon. (As an example, “discretionary ligatures” became “rare ligatures.”)</li><li><strong>Preview.</strong> We also wanted to find a good balance between showing and telling.

Just like I discovered more and more features over the years, I hope you’ll carve out your own corner of the OpenType universe, and assemble your perfect OpenType spice rack. To get you inspired, I collected my personal favorites below. I hope this “best of” list will have something for you whether you’re a graphic designer, a developer, a product person, or simply a typography geek like I am.</p><p>Let’s start with some of my favorite OpenType features – those that teach about typographical legacy, revealing historical letterforms:</p><figure></figure><p>Other features will introduce impressive swashes…</p><figure></figure><p>…or modern and old-school ligatures (including some surprising combinations, for example historical ligatures in a contemporary racing font! 😮):</p><figure></figure><p>OpenType features will be there for programmers…</p><figure></figure><p>…people dealing with numbers…</p><figure></figure><p>…graphic designers…</p><figure></figure><p>…and, of course, user-interface designers (like the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/sf-symbols/overview/">OpenType symbol customization recently added to Apple’s San Francisco fonts</a>):</p><figure></figure><p>Sometimes an OpenType feature can be a tiny adjustment, an almost-imperceptible difference that finally makes something work…</p><figure></figure><p>…an alternative take on a letterform that could be a breath of fresh air…</p><figure></figure><p>…support when dealing with multiple scripts coexisting…</p><figure></figure><p>…an ampersand that will make your day &amp; change your life…</p><figure></figure><p>…a party hat on an otherwise hard-working font…</p><figure></figure><p>…or — like in the case of a font called Avant Garde Gothic — a complete attire ready for all sorts of different parties. (Avant Garde&#39;s embrace of OpenType features is still to me, one of the most fun I’ve seen.)</p><figure></figure><p>In my personal typographical education, learning about OpenType features was a big step somewhere on the line from “I have a favorite font” to “one day I myself will design a typeface.” By making these features more discoverable and accessible in a design tool, I hope this might help propel you in turn on your personal typographical journey.</p><p>Perhaps Figma’s OpenType features will lead you to discover new sides of already familiar fonts. Perhaps they will help solve design challenges that felt unsolvable before. Or, at the very least, maybe they’ll allow you to have a little bit more typographical fun in your life.</p><p>And now, please excuse me as I head to my kitchen, and discover once again how much more I still have to learn about <em>actual</em> spices. Whether I will sneak in a quick session to explore the OpenType features of the font I just bought this morning — there is really no way of knowing.</p><p><em>Let us know about OpenType features you like in your favorite fonts!

      <title>Design critiques at Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/design-critiques-at-figma/</link>
      <description>Learn 6 unique methods for design critique used by the Figma design team, along with some tips and best practices for running them effectively.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Design critiques are a key part of just about every design culture, and one of the few consistent rituals design teams share. Done well, they can leverage the unique superpowers of your team members to raise the collective quality of each individual’s work. Critiques should leave you feeling inspired, challenged, and empowered. However, in practice, it doesn’t always pan out that way. A poorly managed critique can cause your team to feel discouraged, overwhelmed, or completely lost. Over the past year, we’ve made a lot of changes to the way we do critiques at Figma to try and avoid those pitfalls.</p><div><blockquote><p>Our driving philosophy is the belief that critiques should be motivating, not intimidating. Helpful, not discouraging. They should feel fun and be something designers look forward to. Does your team feel this way? If not, there’s an opportunity to turn them around and make them better.</p></blockquote></div><p>We often forget how much of a privilege it is to truly collaborate with talented peers. Recurring design critiques are an essential part of fostering elevated collaboration between team members. We lose sight of the potential of the meeting if they aren’t run well, or if the environment doesn’t feel safe. Getting them right is a critical part of your team’s design culture and identity, and makes a large impact in recruiting and retaining talent!</p><p>In this article, I’ll share how we use critiques at Figma, and how we worked together as a team to turn them into meetings we all enjoy, rather than fear.</p><h2 id="critiquing-critiques"><a href="#critiquing-critiques">Critiquing critiques</a></h2><p>I had been helping facilitate critiques at Figma for about a year when the team decided to get together and chat about what was working and what wasn’t. We set out to “critique critiques”, if you will (🤦‍♂️). Turns out we had quite a large list of problems:  </p><ul><li>The rooms were getting overcrowded</li><li>Feedback was too shallow</li><li>Problems were too complex for a short time frame</li><li>Feedback was not actionable</li><li>There were a lot of unhelpful “group think” and “+1s”</li><li>People were too “nice” rather than “honest”</li><li>Overall, they weren’t unblocking people or helping them move forward</li></ul><p>We collected all of this feedback in a Figma file and organized it into themes to help us make sense of it all.</p><figure><figcaption>We use Figma for everything; including how to “critique critiques”</figcaption></figure><p>Then something interesting happened. During the meeting, people started proposing one idea after another. The energy was light and fun, yet productive. This was ironically the exact feeling we wanted to replicate during critiques themselves!</p><p>What was it about this context that allowed people to loosen up and get creative? Perhaps the stakes were lower? Or no one person felt they personally were getting critiqued? Whatever it was, we were clearly working well together, and it felt great. By identifying the positive flow of the room as it was working, and acknowledging it, we knew our target.</p><p>Recognizing we wouldn’t solve everything in one discussion and that this would be an ongoing process, we created a “#design-crit-crit” channel in Slack to keep iterating together. Especially as our team grows, and as the types of problems we work on change, we wanted to make sure our process is always evolving with the company.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?rect=1,0,2027,1295&amp;w=670&amp;h=428&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da70942b82e3aff8098733a89d2a2667b4c91c97-2029x1295.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Ongoing suggestions in the #design-crit-crit channel</figcaption></figure><h2 id="goals"><a href="#goals">Goals</a></h2><p>As in any good design process, we first had to align on the goals of critique. Only then could we understand and measure if our meetings were actually achieving what we needed. We decided on the following:  </p><ol><li><strong>Unblocking problems &amp; generating ideas:</strong> Many times designers feel stuck on a problem after staring at it for too long, and find it helpful to leverage the broader team to move forward confidently. Other times you’re just getting started, and want to collect any ideas that your team may have already thought of.</li><li><strong>Elevating quality:</strong> Everything from visual design, to interaction details, or overall product direction.</li><li><strong>Encouraging consistency:</strong> We wanted to make sure we were leveraging existing patterns where possible, or flagging when there’s a need for a new one.</li><li><strong>Sharing context:</strong> Design teams are small enough to be in the unique position of having good context for what’s going on in the company. This allows people to identify overlaps and connections between projects that people in other roles might not have as much access to.</li></ol><p>Noticeably missing from this is: “Making major product decisions” or “Determining product roadmaps.” Design critiques are not the forum for that; teams should have separate roadmapping processes to determine direction. Critiques need to remain a safe space for exploration and feedback, independent from roadmap decision making and free from stress.</p><p>Ultimately, critiques exist to help the designer/presenter — the person looking for support. In that way, it’s really up to them to utilize the best approach to accomplish that. The rest of the design team simply needs to commit to being present and ready to help.</p><h2 id="_6-critique-methods"><a href="#_6-critique-methods">6 critique methods</a></h2><p>With those goals in mind, we put together six different critique methods, each with their own strengths and purposes. They are designed to take place either in a 1-hour meeting (usually 2 topics, 20-30 minutes each) or in smaller ad hoc meetings, depending on the method. With the exception of the “Paper Print-Out,” any of these should work great for remote teams as well.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?rect=1,0,2170,1496&amp;w=670&amp;h=462&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/21f919178e670df56ca2ed8fc69ff4004d0bf665-2171x1496.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="_1-standard"><a href="#_1-standard">1.

You’re ok with some discussion, and ideally, have specific feedback you’re looking for.</p><p><strong>Step 0: Set-up</strong></p><p>Before or as people are walking in, set up sticky notes and pens at each chair to encourage people to write down ideas throughout the meeting.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Sharing context &amp; internalizing feedback (~10-15m)</strong></p><p>Start the meeting by explaining the context of the project (if people aren’t already familiar with it). Why is it important? What are the goals? The project goals are the foundation of the project, and if people miss that part, their feedback will be misdirected. Decide if you want people to interrupt with questions, or wait until you’re done sharing, and let them know which you prefer. Include a slide dedicated to “Here’s the feedback I am looking for,” and conversely, “Here’s what I’m NOT looking for” to keep the discussion focused. Remind them to write down their thoughts as you’re going through the content. </p><p>Rather than present on a big screen, we often send everyone a Figma link and have them jump into <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-feature-highlight-observation-mode/">Observation Mode</a>. We find it much easier to see details this way, it works great for remote participants, is more reliable connectivity-wise, and better for high frame-rates than most screen-sharing software. You run the small risk of people wandering in the file rather than observing, but we’ve found that can also sometimes be a good thing if someone missed something but didn’t want to stop the full group for it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Clarifying questions (~2-5m)</strong></p><p>After you finish presenting, take a few minutes to allow anyone to jump in with clarifying questions. This is important because if one person is confused, it is likely others are as well. You want questions clarified before folks jump in with feedback to ensure everyone is on the same page.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Receiving feedback (10m+)</strong></p><p>We have two very different approaches to receiving feedback from the room. We’ve branded them to make them easier for the facilitator/presenter to request which form they prefer to receive feedback in:  </p><ul><li>Round-The-Room (RTR 🎡) — Go one at a time around the room, and give everyone a chance to voice their feedback. Try to keep it to two minutes per person. No “interruptions” from others — if they have a pressing thought, encourage them to write it down for their turn. It’s important to go one at a time and give space for the person speaking to help folks who may not normally feel comfortable speaking up in groups. Having a structured format to receive feedback like this enables us to be more inclusive of different people and preferences. Allow people to “pass” if they have nothing to add, or if they’d like to think more and provide feedback later.</li><li>Popcorn (🍿) — Freeform discussion. It’s called Popcorn because comments pop up from all over the place unpredictably. This is more improvisational and helpful for flowing conversation where people can jump in with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3042080/yes-and-5-more-lessons-in-improv-ing-collaboration-and-creativity-from-second-city">“Yes, and...”</a> We often use Popcorn if we’re short on time and preface it with, “Any one have any critical things you feel the need to share?” Then we’ll document any other comments later. However, please note that this method can be dangerous for inclusion as it can reward the “loudest voice.” To combat this, I’d encourage the group to call on people who haven’t spoken (if they’re comfortable with that), or moderate the conversation a bit if it’s getting lopsided.</li></ul><p>As you’re receiving feedback, try not to get defensive and justify everything. It’s best to model good behavior by simply thanking people for their feedback. You don’t need to respond immediately to everyone’s points. It’s ok to take time to consider what they’re after and get back to them later.</p><h4 id=""><a href="#"></a></h4><p>Don’t forget to thank everyone, and let people know how best to send you feedback if they think of anything else. Should they send it via Slack? In a notes document somewhere? In the Figma file? Are you free to meet with them individually? If so, when? You could also put the work on them to find time with you, which can filter out people who felt strongly enough to do that. More often I prefer to make it as easy for people to contribute as their ideas are usually quite helpful.</p><h2 id="_2-jams-workshops"><a href="#_2-jams-workshops">2.

Maybe you’re looking to soak in as much as you can from other people about what they may have already thought about or explored in the past. Maybe you just want a kick-start to be as divergent and exploratory as possible before starting to narrow in. Your design team brings together so many different perspectives and skills that involving them early can often inspire entirely new concepts, and help avoid tunnel-vision. </p><p><strong>How:</strong> There are lots of methods out there for brainstorming. If you’re using paper, personally I love the <a href="https://www.iamnotmypixels.com/how-to-use-crazy-8s-to-generate-design-ideas/">Crazy 8</a>’s method. Our favorite way of doing these, however, is inside of Figma itself. In particular, one recent fun example was when one of our design interns, <a href="https://andrewshen.net/">Andrew Shen</a>, got a bunch of us in a room to research his summer project, “Comments in Figma.” </p><p>All Andrew had to do was drop us a Figma file with a few prompting questions for us to jam on. Things like, “What are the biggest problems with comments today?” “What commenting experiences do we like?” “Any ideas on how they should behave?” “Should they be more like email or like Slack?” </p><p>Then we were off to the races — we went heads down for 30 minutes and started dropping in references, snippets of texts, and anything else we could to get our ideas across. This quickly became much deeper than just a survey or a poll because you could see others’ ideas in real-time, and start to riff off of them together. After going heads down, we went around the room and discussed each other’s ideas, adding any clarification where needed. In just a single hour, Andrew had leveraged the collective brainpower of six people, and had tons of material to work from when starting to sketch out some ideas.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670&amp;h=360&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6882f2ed2fea29ab6a409498f0bc25e423f8229-1210x650.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1210w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Andrew’s Figma file for us didn’t require much prep or even facilitation — just a few empty frames with questions in them and we were off to the races.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_3-pair-design"><a href="#_3-pair-design">3.

It’s hard to get a big room thinking about everything all at once, so organizing participants into small groups is much more productive</p><p>Perhaps our most popular alternative method so far, pair designing has become a staple in our process at Figma. So much so that for a little while, once a week we dedicated one of the critiques to strictly using this method. We’d start each meeting by dividing people up into groups of no more than three people to tackle problems. </p><p>We’ve since moved away from requiring this once a week because it didn’t feel right to force people to use a method if they weren’t ready for it. Instead, we’ve started encouraging people to plan these meetings ad hoc. Now, people simply shout out in the design channel on Slack, “Hey, anyone free to pair?” — then they schedule a separate time together. </p><p>Another way to encourage frequent pair designing is by assigning a “co-pilot” to any lead designer working a project. At a start up like Figma, we’re a small team so there aren’t enough designers to have multiple people on the same problem full-time. We found that by assigning a partner even just part-time, it can make a big difference in feeling less alone while solving a problem. It hasn’t been perfect or consistent; for many projects we forget to assign a co-pilot or people simply get too busy. But as we grow, we hope to formalize this further.</p><p>It’s worth noting that pair designing is not a new concept. Engineers have been <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming">pair programming</a> for years to help debug problems and catch mistakes. Going back even further, as far back as 10-220 CE, Rabbis used to urge students to acquire study partners under a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chavrusa">Havruta</a>; an approach to Talmudic study where small groups analyze and debate text together:</p><div><blockquote><p>The Havruta relationship gives each student a platform to clarify and explain his position to a partner; then the two go on to question, defend, convince, amend, fine-tune, and even arrive at new conclusions through rigorous intellectual collaboration.</p></blockquote></div><p>Professor Nathaniel Deutsch gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0uAlUaQxeA">pretty cool lecture about the benefits of practicing in pairs</a> from this historical context if you’re curious to learn more about it. </p><p>And if you’d like to continue discussing pair design in general, I’d recommend reaching out to <a href="https://twitter.com/Soengle/status/1152239694454784005">Stephanie Engle</a> who’s been <a href="https://twitter.com/Soengle/status/1156974715589632001">thinking a lot about this</a> as she’s found pair sessions particularly helpful during her time working at Cruise and at Facebook.</p><h2 id="_4-silent-critiques"><a href="#_4-silent-critiques">4.

But bear with us. We first got the idea to try this after Niko, one of our designers, read the <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/the-silent-meeting-manifesto-v1-189e9e3487eb">Silent Meetings Manifesto</a>. In it, the author, David Gasca, laments his frustrations for typical corporate meetings, and offers a unique alternative:</p><div><blockquote><p>&#39;Silent Meetings&#39; are meetings where most of the time is spent thinking and discussing [via writing] the topics at hand. Functionally, they are based around a &#39;Table Read&#39; that everyone at the meeting reads silently, comments in and then discusses.</p></blockquote></div><p>The basic idea is that verbal communication in a group setting only allows for one line of conversation at a time. You have a speaker, and a bunch of listeners. By not relying on speaking, a “Silent Meeting” can instead offer multiple conversation threads simultaneously, allowing for a greater volume of feedback to be received in a shorter period of time. </p><p>For the givers, it allows the inclusive opportunity to more deeply internalize the work, and write thoughtful responses by being able to move at their own pace. For the receiver, it can be exhilarating and exhausting, but also very rewarding. Niko, for example, works remotely from Germany and often finds himself needing half a day to process the avalanche of feedback. And although it can feel overwhelming at first, it can spark so many new ideas over time.</p><p>Silent critiques do require more preparation work as they effectively need to work asynchronously; the audience needs to be able to gather all the context necessary inside the document to offer feedback. Another reason this works particularly well for remote designers, is that they often have time and interest for exercises that get the most out of their limited interactions with headquarters.</p><p>These Silent critiques can also be done completely asynchronously by sending out a prompt in a Slack channel. But we found that the main advantage of scheduling a set time or doing in person is to ensure people actually take the time to review the work.</p><figure><figcaption>Timelapse of a recent Silent critique we ran at Figma</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_5-paper-print-out-critiques"><a href="#_5-paper-print-out-critiques">5.

Crazy, right? Sometimes I think we forget how valuable it was then to get the chance to work with physical materials. We’re so used to staring at screens all day that we assume meetings have to run this way too. Actually encouraging people to get up and move around has a ton of benefits. Ideas may flow more freely, and the change in context can be helpful for not feeling so limited by pixels.</p><p>If you went to design school like I did, you might have had the profoundly memorable experience where professors would hang up all of the students work on foam core or cork walls and teach everyone how to critique it together. Sometimes they’d take a big red pen and annotate all over it. The class would surround the work, one at a time, and talk through what was working and what wasn’t. In my nearly 10 years designing products since then, I can only remember a small handful of times the design teams I worked on tried this method. Instead, we most often pointed at a screen on one side of the room, some of the time sitting nearly 20 feet (~6 meters) away from it!</p><p>Jenny, Rasmus, and Marcin, three of our product designers at Figma, have been particularly big proponents of getting us out of our chairs and back to the basics. The meeting can be run the same way as a “standard critique,” except we’re all gathering around the print outs, and attaching sticky notes as feedback. </p><p>Given that this method doesn’t work well for remote attendees, we combat this by assigning a note taker, recording the meeting, and taking photos. If the attendee can join in real-time, we&#39;ll often have a complementary Figma file (which doesn’t take much extra effort to make since you already needed to make one for printing), which lets them have their own “digital wall” if they’d like to try and follow along and add comments that way. If you really wanted to, you could even have the note taker try and transcribe their digital notes into physical ones to keep them together.</p><p>We end up doing this no more than once a month simply because of the overhead, and the reality of needing to put this feedback back in digitally. But once in a while, it’s a real treat to change up our day-to-day and goes a long way in opening up the conversation.</p><p><strong>Bonus:</strong> A great side-effect of this is method is that it doubles as an amazing and lightweight way to share context or spark discussions with people from other functions in the office. If you’re able to, consider leaving the work up in the room even after the meeting, or even better if it’s on foam core that you can move it out to a more visible space in the office. The next time you see someone standing there, talk to them and ask them what they’re thinking! This fosters random cross-contamination, increases the context, and can increase the chance of serendipitous moments.</p><h2 id="_6-fyi"><a href="#_6-fyi">6.

Think ahead of time which ones will be most effective for the problem at hand. <em>Stuck on a problem or a particular UI puzzle? Consider a “Jam     session.” Kicking off a new project? Try out a “Workshop.” Reviewing a bunch of options? Try a “Standing critique.” Working on something particularly complex? Try “Pair design” to get deeper into the problem.</em></li><li><strong>Schedule topics early:</strong> Schedule critiques ahead of time on Monday mornings, and update your calendar events to reflect the topics. This helps create mini-deadlines for designers, and also helps plan ahead for which guests you feel are most important to attend.</li><li><strong>Use smaller rooms:</strong> We’ve found smaller rooms create more cozy environments. Out of conference room space? Just huddle around someone’s computer or form a circle of chairs. Find a coffee shop. Avoid large rooms that incite a “corporate board room” feeling.</li><li><strong>Buy a timer and keep diligent time:</strong> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000J5OFW0/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?psc=1&amp;pd_rd_i=B000J5OFW0&amp;pd_rd_w=0b5rk&amp;pf_rd_p=8a8f3917-7900-4ce8-ad90-adf0d53c0985&amp;pd_rd_wg=c6VLg&amp;pf_rd_r=50BK5XE91J2HHEQ8ZBH9&amp;pd_rd_r=d2331a98-e955-4605-a044-367b40ec08d9&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFGQUhUOUpSRDlFSDgmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAzMTk1MDVRM1VKNlNCWUVVN0UmZW5jcnlwdGVkQWRJZD1BMDMxNzk2OTI3VzNPMTgxNjgzSVAmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWwmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl">We use this simple 60m timer</a>. Try it out to make sure you are prompt with timing for each topic. As a facilitator, do your best to take note of how long topics are taking, to plan better for future topics. As you’d expect, topics always take at least 10 minutes more than people think they will. We&#39;ve recently started only allowing a maximum of two topics per one hour critique because of this.</li><li><strong>Take notes:</strong> We’ve tried different ways of including people who can’t attend (be it time-zones, vacation, sick leave, or anything else). For example, we tried automatic <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004794983-Automatically-Transcribe-Cloud-Recordings-">transcription features on our recordings with Zoom</a>, but that turned out to be too much unfiltered content to consume. Our best results have come from pairing this recording with an assigned note taker in the room summarize the notes to hit the right spot between exhaustive but digestible.</li><li><strong>Think about what you need from the room:</strong> Time is precious, respect others&#39; time by planning 30 minutes beforehand to decide what you want help with. If you’re collecting feedback inside of Figma, be sure to leave ample space around your file, and perhaps a few sticky notes if you’d like people to annotate on the canvas.</li><li><strong>Consider HOW you deliver feedback:</strong> There are all kinds of frameworks for giving valuable feedback from <a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/">radical candor</a>, to the <a href="https://blog.ed.ted.com/2017/11/09/how-to-give-effective-feedback-on-a-talk/">playing cards method</a>, to this <a href="https://twitter.com/mgoldst/status/634446580297375744">critique chart</a>. Niko created a <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/zN2miw6msG4VVTIGHDaDqm/7-Types-of-Crit-Feedback?node-id=5%3A6&amp;scaling=scale-down">nice guide to remind ourselves how feedback can take so many different forms</a>.</li><li><strong>Be vulnerable:</strong> There are lots of ways to improve psychological safety and trust on teams, which is critical if you want your team to feel comfortable giving and receiving feedback. Adam Grant has a great podcast called <a href="https://www.ted.com/podcasts/worklife">WorkLife</a>, and I recommend listening to <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily-shows-secret-to-creativity/id1346314086?i=1000405268582">the episode about The Daily Show</a> that talks about how Trevor Noah sets an example of vulnerability by sharing embarrassing stories in the beginning of each meeting to set the tone of “It’s ok to mess up.” Jon Bell also offers a fun concept with <a href="https://medium.com/@jonbell/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d">The McDonald’s Theory</a>, which you could use to help break the ice if you’re noticing a particularly shy room.</li><li><strong>Remember to critique OUTSIDE of weekly meetings:</strong> You don’t need to wait for once or twice a week to receive feedback. Reach out to your team and schedule “pair design” sessions, or “offline critiques” to make sure you’re never waiting when you’re ready for feedback.</li><li><strong>Experiment and iterate:</strong> Feel comfortable experimenting and iterating constantly. Just as design is never done, you should treat design processes the same way. By framing improvements as experiments, your team may be more open to change.

      <title>How Microsoft built plugins to improve their workflow</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-microsoft-built-plugins-to-improve-their-workflow/</link>
      <description>Discover how Microsoft customizes their processes with Figma Plugins to more seamlessly integrate their Fluent design system into their workflow and help designers be more efficient.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since the introduction of its Fluent design system, Microsoft has been on a mission to improve usability, consistency, and accessibility across all their products. But driving adoption across multiple product lines, organizations, and teams comes with its fair share of complexities. Tooling is more important than ever. As Eugene Gavriloff, Design Tools Team Lead, explains, “We’re constantly thinking about how to create better design tools and services that help people make great products.” And that is where Figma plugins come into play. </p><p>Plugins can serve as little power-ups to a designer’s process. For large teams, they can bring more efficiency to your workflow and help eliminate tedious tasks. But sometimes, you may need a private plugin tailored specifically to your team&#39;s needs, like bringing in relevant data, importing translations, or automating tedious work.  </p><p>For Microsoft, the opportunity to customize their processes with Figma Plugins meant they could more seamlessly integrate the Fluent design system into their workflow and help designers be more efficient. As <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-plugins-jackie-chui-microsoft/">Jackie Chui</a>, UX designer, puts it, “The more tools we integrate into our Fluent design system, the more useful our system becomes.” Let’s see what they’ve built…</p><h2 id="bring-custom-design-assets-into-figma"><a href="#bring-custom-design-assets-into-figma">Bring custom design assets into Figma</a></h2><p>Every designer knows that dummy content can fail to capture design intent; lorem ipsum doesn&#39;t always cut it. And at Microsoft dropping in generic content can lead to issues, even if used in a mock or prototype. So Eugene created a custom plugin called <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/731627216655469013/Content-Reel/">Content Reel</a> which helps Microsoft designers find specific content for their layouts.</p><figure></figure><p>While this plugin is available to the community, Microsoft has an internal version just for their teams. For example, Microsoft’s version of Content Reel pulls in approved text strings, avatars, and icons into their designs. Not only does this make the designer’s life easier, but it also removes the process of finding or seeking approval on specific content. </p><p>Interested in building your own Content Reel plugin? We imagine every company can have its own version of Content Reel that pulls in custom content, approved by their organization. </p><h2 id="switch-between-your-own-libraries-easily"><a href="#switch-between-your-own-libraries-easily">Switch between your own libraries easily</a></h2><p>For companies with multiple products, it’s a common practice to have unique libraries and styles for each product. At Microsoft, they have hundreds of libraries in Figma. At this scale, adapting designs to multiple product styles can be a manual, thankless process. Thus Jackie set out to solve this challenge. He created Themer, which allows Microsoft designers to quickly switch between their multiple product themes like Work, Outlook, and others.</p><figure></figure><p>If you’re looking to create your own version of Themer, first check out the publicly available <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/731176732337510831/Themer/">Themer plugin</a> built by our very own Design Advocate, Tom Lowry.  Tom’s Themer plugin allows you to easily swap between published styles from your libraries.</p><p>Ever mindful of their workflows, designers recognized how much time they spent on repetitive tasks. To free up time for creative problem solving, the Microsoft team also built a suite of plugins to help each other – and any design team – trade the daily grind for an efficient state of zen.</p><p>For Jackie, his passion for plugins preceded plugins themselves. A natural tinkerer, he’s been exploring the Figma API ever since the launch of <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-platform/">Figma platform</a> more than a year ago and loves building tools that empower designers to focus on what they do best—creating beautiful experiences. “Figma has become the primary design tool in Microsoft,” Jackie says, “so it only makes sense for me to start building on the platform that helps my team&#39;s workflow and expand outward from there.” Here are a few of Jackie’s plugins available to the Figma community:</p><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/735072959812183643/Find-and-Replace/"><strong>Find and Replace does</strong></a> just what it says; it searches for texts on your page and replaces them just like a text editor.</p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/740097744539225981/Paste-to-Fill/"><strong>Paste to Fill</strong></a> enables you to copy an image and paste it as a fill on your selected layers. You can also paste in an image URL to load its image as a layer fill.</p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/740127005583346577/Button-Resizer/"><strong>Button Resizer</strong></a> allows you to easily resize your button to fit its label width.</p><figure></figure><p>Another plugin enthusiast is Microsoft designer <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-plugins-tiffany-chen-microsoft/">Tiffany Chen</a>. She sits on the Modern Input and Accessibility team where she is focused on creating more awareness around making product experiences more inclusive. She is on a mission to reverse how designers approach accessibility at Microsoft. She explains, “We tend to think of accessibility as an afterthought—something that gets tacked on at the end of the product development process, but that results in a lot of serious implications.” </p><p>Tiffany has built a handful of accessibility tools that empower her fellow designers to bring designing accessibility to the forefront. Her vision is to build an entire suite of accessibility plugins and make them available to the public. Here are the first of Tiffany’s accessibility plugins:</p><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/731310036968334777/Focus-Orderer/"><strong>Focus Orderer</strong></a> automates a lot of the (very manual) design process for annotating for accessibility purposes. It enables you to quickly annotate your designs’ focus / tab order flow, so the flow of focused, interactable objects is meaningful.</p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/733159460536249875/Color-Contrast-Checker/"><strong>Color Contrast Checker</strong></a> checks the color contrast ratio of all visible text in a frame and provides feedback on whether it meets WCAG’s AA and/or AAA level compliance. It also provides color sliders that allow users to adjust the colors and understand how the corresponding contrast ratio changes in real-time.</p><figure></figure><p>This is just the beginning for the Microsoft team. In addition to building out the functionality of Content Reel and publishing more accessibility plugins, the team plans to tap into telemetry data and integrate it into their design processes, like a private plugin that captures usage data of Fluent design system components. </p><p>Creating a Figma plugin is as easy as building a webpage.

      <title>Keeping your data in Figma safe and secure: SOC 2 Type 2, SSO, and more</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/keeping-your-data-in-figma-safe-and-secure/</link>
      <description>At Figma, security is part of everything we do. Learn more about our recent security improvements.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Update January 28, 2020</strong></p><p>When we first wrote this post, we had achieved our SOC 2 Type 1 certification and were in the process of pursuing SOC 2 Type 2. </p><p>Today, we’re excited to share that Figma has successfully completed our SOC 2 Type 2 certification.</p><p>You may be wondering, what’s the difference?</p><p>You can think of SOC 2 Type 1 as a snapshot in time report. While valuable, SOC 2 Type 2 provides additional assurance of data security, because it requires an audit of how internal controls are working over time. Figma also secured a SOC 3 report, which summarizes the SOC 2 Type 2 report, and can be <a href="https://static.figma.com/uploads/ad389cff083e419f07f6f08c7947ec9347c7e716">downloaded here</a>. </p><p>We are committed to protecting our customers’ data and design IP, and will continue to invest in our platform security. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="WNkK9W0w-M3R" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>At Figma, we focus on building new features that our customers love to use, like Smart Selection, GIFs in prototypes, plugins, and many more. But we are just as invested in what happens behind the scenes that keeps your data and design IP safe. </p><p>The Infrastructure team&#39;s mission is to build a platform that is powerful, fast, and secure. That way we can support faster innovation and snappier user experience. To achieve this mission, the safety and security of users&#39; data is paramount for us; it is the cornerstone for the trust you place in us when you store your design IP with Figma.</p><p>To accomplish this, security is part of everything we do. It’s top of mind in how we work, treat customer data, and develop our product. Here are a few recent security improvements we’ve made to Figma: </p><h2 id="we-got-soc-2-type-1-certified"><a href="#we-got-soc-2-type-1-certified">We got SOC 2 Type 1 certified</a></h2><p>We’re pleased to announce that we’ve successfully completed our SOC 2 Type 1 certification! In case you’re new to SaaS security, here’s why this is important to you. SOC 2 is the standard for security compliance for software companies in the United States. Its guidelines and policies are designed to help businesses like Figma protect customer data that’s stored in the cloud. </p><p>In order for companies to be SOC 2 certified, they must undergo an audit of their infrastructure, software, HR processes, and policies around handling customer data to ensure they have all the necessary security procedures and controls in place. Getting SOC 2 Type 1 certification is only the first step. We are currently pursuing SOC 2 Type 2 certification, where we continue to validate and demonstrate our security operations over time. Stay tuned in the latter part of 2019 for more SOC 2 updates. </p><h2 id="we-re-ready-for-our-european-customers"><a href="#we-re-ready-for-our-european-customers">We’re ready for our European customers</a></h2><p>Whether you’re already headquartered in Europe or looking to expand internationally, Figma is ready for you. As Figma’s customer base continues to grow quickly throughout Europe, we must meet the security and compliance requirements in the European Union and beyond. Figma complies with data protection requirements and is certified under both the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.</p><h2 id="security-is-top-priority-for-every-new-feature"><a href="#security-is-top-priority-for-every-new-feature">Security is top priority for every new feature</a></h2><p>Since the <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-plugins/">launch of Figma Plugins</a>, it’s been incredibly exciting to see our customers build plugins on our platform. But opening up our platform meant we had to be thoughtful about what we give developers access to, so we can uphold our standards around security, stability, and performance. </p><p>Rudi Chen, one of the software engineers behind our plugins platform, recently wrote a <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/">great in-depth article</a> on our engineering approach. Security was the top priority, perhaps even at the expense of additional platform capabilities. For example, we made sure Figma Plugins could only access a single design file and never a user’s entire account; one plugin also cannot access another plugin’s data. The team also made the decision to not allow a Figma Plugin to change the Figma UI, leading to potential user misdirection (and making the user vulnerable to phishing attacks). </p><p>Without spoiling more of <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/">Rudi’s post</a>, I highly encourage you to dive in and read about what our team learned and the technical risks we took in our development journey.</p><h2 id="saml-figma"><a href="#saml-figma">SAML + Figma = 👍</a></h2><p>Lastly, we know your organization requires a certain level of enterprise security. Integrations with your preferred SAML SSO provider not only makes logging into Figma easier, but it enables you to securely deploy Figma to your entire organization and control all user access. We now integrate with OneLogin, along with previously-supported Okta and Microsoft Azure Active Directory. </p><p>Looking for more good reads?- Peruse all the details regarding our <a href="https://www.figma.com/security/">security</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/privacy/">privacy</a> policies- Check out the latest product updates on our <a href="https://www.figma.com/whats-new/">What’s New page</a>- <a href="https://www.figma.com/organization/">Contact sales</a> for a 1:1 chat about Figma Organization</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Plugins to help you design with real content</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/plugins-to-help-you-design-with-real-content/</link>
      <description>Save time and effort while creating more realistic mockups using real data with this collection of useful plugins.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At one point or another, we&#39;ve all reached for &#39;Lorem Ipsum&#39; text as placeholder content in a design (there is a plugin for that!), but sometimes having real (or more realistic) data can help stress test a design or provide a more accurate depiction of what your UI will actually look like—especially when the data is your own! Content can be anything from names, phone numbers and addresses to user-avatars and other imagery. Adding or updating content across a complex design can also be time-consuming if you have to manually populate dozens of text boxes across your document. Paste-no-more! In this article, we&#39;ll cover some of the most useful data population plugins that will help you design with real content and save time to boot!</p><h2 id="google-sheets-sync"><a href="#google-sheets-sync">Google Sheets Sync</a></h2><p>Creator: <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidWilliames">David Williames</a></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/735770583268406934/Google-Sheets-Sync/">Google Sheets Sync</a> does exactly what you think—it lets you sync data in a spreadsheet to elements in your design. The setup is easy: create a Google Sheet with a shareable link, and make a column for every type of data that you want. Each column should have a unique header (ex: Name, Address, Country). In Figma, name your layers with a # followed by the column header from the sheet (ex: #Name, #Address, #Country). Then launch the plugin, enter your shareable URL, and hit the &#34;Fetch &amp; sync&#34; button. And voila—your entire design is populated in seconds. Google Sheets Sync is also really handy because you can still manage your data with all of the benefits and features of a spreadsheet; making it a breeze to leverage formulas or make updates down the road. As an added bonus, you can also include a URL with images in your columns; so if you want to populate a shape with an image fill, just name the layer the same as you would for a text layer and the plugin will take care of the rest.</p><h2 id="unsplash"><a href="#unsplash">Unsplash</a></h2><p>Creator: <a href="https://twitter.com/LiamMartens9512">Liam Martens</a>, in collaboration with <a href="https://twitter.com/kirillz">Kirill Zakharov</a> at <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a></p><figure></figure><p>It&#39;s hard to think of a better place to find beautiful photography on the web—<a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/738454987945972471/">Unsplash</a> has over a million high resolution images (free for personal and commercial use) from some of the world’s most generous photographers. Need some amazing imagery for your project? Simply launch the plugin then choose from a predefined category, a randomly selected image, or search the collection for that perfect image. By default, the plugin will insert a high resolution photo onto the canvas. You can also insert photos as image fills by pre-selecting all of the elements you wish to apply the fill to.</p><h2 id="data-lab"><a href="#data-lab">Data Lab</a></h2><p>Creator: <a href="https://twitter.com/pavelkuligin93">Pavel Kuligin</a></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/740286071386014712/Data-Lab/">Data Lab</a> is a plugin that lets you populate textual content using simple variables that you can combine into a single string and customize formatting. It comes with formatting for numbers, names, dates, telephone numbers, emails and lists (that use comma-separated values). For example, if you wanted a name, followed by an email address, separated by a middle-dot, you could input the following: <code>{NAME} · {EMAIL}</code>. Data Lab is dead simple to use and looks to have an exciting roadmap with more features down the road.</p><h2 id="content-reel"><a href="#content-reel">Content Reel</a></h2><p>Creator: <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/org/588096576863690753/">Microsoft</a></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/731627216655469013/Content-Reel/">Content Reel</a> is another option that enables you to quickly insert text-based content into your designs. Out of the box, it’s loaded with names, phone numbers, US addresses, numbers, emails, URLs, companies, usernames, and countries. One of the coolest features of the plugin is that many of the data types are customizable via a drag-and-drop UI. Want to change how an address is formatted? Simply enable the attributes you want to include, and drag them into the desired order. You can even control the placement of the commas. Content Reel also gives you easy access to the Segoe MDL2 icon library (but make sure you install the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/style/segoe-ui-symbol-font#how-do-i-get-this-font">Segoe icon-font</a> to use them). The developers also plan to support image-based content for things like user-profile images in a future release. As an added bonus, one of the features I like most about this plugin is the compact mode which allows you collapse the UI into a small panel that you can leave open as you’re designing.</p><h2 id="mapsicle"><a href="#mapsicle">Mapsicle</a></h2><p>Creator: <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisarvinsf">Chris Arvin</a></p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/736458162635847353/Mapsicle/">Mapsicle</a> is a feature-packed plugin that allows you to add <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> maps right into your design. To use it, simply select an element, launch Mapsicle, configure the map to your liking, and hit the &#34;Create map&#34; button to add it as an image fill to the element. To make the most of this plugin, you will want to have an <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/access-token/">access token from Mapbox</a>, especially if you have defined your own map themes within Mapbox. In addition to being able to use your own themes, the plugin comes with support for default themes like Light, Dark, Satellite, Streets, and more. For each map, you can also control the zoom level as well as the camera pitch and rotation. Chris has also added some really handy features that allow you to update the size of an existing map without having to reset it each time. For example, you insert your map on a mobile design, and then move onto designing a tablet version—there is an option to &#34;Refresh selected map&#34; which will maintain the same zoom level and update it for the larger dimensions. One added tip—try nesting a map inside a smaller frame. In your prototyping settings you can configure the frame&#39;s overflow behavior to &#34;Horizontal &amp; Vertical Scrolling&#34; to give users the ability to pan across the map in both directions inside your prototypes.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="uOfiBWAOmDAj" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We hope that these handy data population plugins help speed up your workflow and enhance the level of accuracy and realism in your mockups. Being able to use your actual data is a great way to stress test your design. It is also a great use-case for private plugins! Have sensitive data? Using your own internal API to deliver actual data in your app? Users on the Figma Organization plan have the ability to author and publish their own private plugins that are specific to their company. With a single click, you can also distribute it to everyone by installing it for all users in your organization.

      <title>How to build a plugin system on the web and also sleep well at night</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/</link>
      <description>The solution we found helps us run Figma plugins in a safe way — i.e. not eval(UNTRUSTED_CODE).</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Editor&#39;s Note: Since we published this blog post, we decided to change our sandbox implementation to an alternative approach: compiling a JavaScript VM written in C to WebAssembly. As you&#39;ll see in the blog post below, it was one of several ideas we originally weighed.</em></p><p><em>We decided to implement this alternative after a security vulnerability in the Realms shim (which our original approach uses) was privately disclosed to us. The security vulnerability was promptly fixed by the Realms shim team before the vulnerability was made public and we have no evidence it was ever exploited. Read more about the vulnerability and our approach to fixing it <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/an-update-on-plugin-security/">here</a>.</em></p><p>At Figma, we recently tackled one of our biggest engineering challenges yet: supporting plugins. Our plugins API enables third-party developers to run code directly inside our browser-based design tool, so teams can adapt Figma to their own workflows. They can enable <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/732603254453395948/Stark/">accessibility checkers</a> to measure contrast, <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/733062974250826253/Translate/">translation apps</a> to convert language, <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/738454987945972471/Unsplash/">importers</a> to populate designs with content, and anything else their heart desires.</p><p>We knew we needed to design this plugin functionality carefully. Throughout the history of software, there have been many instances where third-party extensions negatively affected a platform. In some cases, they slowed the tool to a crawl. In other cases, the plugins broke whenever new versions of the platform were released. To the extent that we could control it, we wanted users to have a better plugin experience with Figma.</p><p>Furthermore, we wanted to make sure plugins would be safe for users to run, so we knew we wouldn’t want to simply <code>eval(PLUGIN_CODE)</code>. That is the quintessential definition of insecure! Yet, eval is essentially what running a plugin boils down to.</p><p>To add to the challenge, Figma is built on a very unconventional stack with constraints that previous tools haven’t had. Our design editor is powered by <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/">WebGL</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/">WebAssembly</a>, with some of the user interface implemented in Typescript &amp; React. Multiple people can be <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/multiplayer-editing-in-figma/">editing a file at the same time</a>. We are powered by browser technologies, but also limited by them.</p><p>This blog post will walk you through our pursuit for the perfect plugin solution. Ultimately, our efforts boiled down to one question: How do you run plugins with security, stability, and performance? Here’s a brief overview of our many non-trivial constraints:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dadc8e3f372dd3f2708519e6f79e942a355a6ab-2296x1498.png?w=670&amp;h=437&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dadc8e3f372dd3f2708519e6f79e942a355a6ab-2296x1498.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dadc8e3f372dd3f2708519e6f79e942a355a6ab-2296x1498.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dadc8e3f372dd3f2708519e6f79e942a355a6ab-2296x1498.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dadc8e3f372dd3f2708519e6f79e942a355a6ab-2296x1498.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dadc8e3f372dd3f2708519e6f79e942a355a6ab-2296x1498.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>We considered dozens of different approaches branching into all sorts of different paths. We had weeks of discussing, prototyping and brainstorming. This blog post will focus on just three of those attempts that formed the most central path in our exploration.</p><p>For me, it has been the most satisfying exercise in first principles thinking. I had fun leveraging all the computer science fundamentals I learned in the classroom (the ones I never thought I’d ever use in the real world). If that idea excites you too, <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">we’re hiring</a>!</p><h2 id="attempt-1-the-sandbox-approach"><a href="#attempt-1-the-sandbox-approach">Attempt #1: The  sandbox approach</a></h2><p>During our first few weeks of research, we found many interesting attempts at third-party code sandboxing. Some used techniques such as code-to-code transformation. However, most had not been validated in a production application and as such, carried some risk.</p><p>In the end, for our first attempt, we went for the closest thing to a standard sandboxing solution: the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> tag. It’s used in applications that need to run third-party code, such as CodePen.</p><p>The <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is not your everyday HTML tag. To understand why <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s are secure, it’s necessary to think about what properties they need to guarantee. An <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is typically used to embed one website into another website. For example, in the screenshot below, you can see that yelp.com is embedding google.com/maps to provide map functionality.</p><figure></figure><p>Here, you wouldn’t want Yelp to be able to read what’s inside a Google website just by virtue of embedding it. There could be private user information in there. Similarly, you wouldn’t want Google to be able to read what’s inside a Yelp website just by virtue of having been embedded.</p><p>This means communication to and from the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is heavily restricted by browsers. When an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> has a different origin than its container (e.g. yelp.com v.s. google.com), they are completely isolated. Then, the only way to communicate with the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is via message-passing. These messages are, for all intents and purposes, plain strings. Upon receipt, each website is free to take action on those message, or ignore them.</p><p>They’re so isolated, in fact, that the HTML spec allow browsers to implement <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s as separate processes, <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/oop-iframes">if they chose to</a>.</p><p>Now that we know how <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s work, we can implement plugins by creating a new <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> every time a plugin runs, and sticking the plugin’s code inside the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. The plugin can do anything it wants inside the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>. However, it won’t be able to interact with Figma documents except through explicit, whitelisted messages. The <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> is also a given a null origin, which means that any attempt to make a request to figma.com will be denied by the browser’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS">cross-origin resource sharing policies</a>. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fc301e8b64dca86544a67d114c164ccb680770ad-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fc301e8b64dca86544a67d114c164ccb680770ad-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fc301e8b64dca86544a67d114c164ccb680770ad-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fc301e8b64dca86544a67d114c164ccb680770ad-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fc301e8b64dca86544a67d114c164ccb680770ad-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Effectively, the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> acts as a sandbox for the plugin. Furthermore, the security properties of the sandbox are guaranteed by browser vendors, who have spent years searching for and fixing any vulnerability in the sandbox.</p><p>An actual plugin using this sandbox model would use an API that we add into the sandbox and look roughly like this:</p><div><pre><code><span>const</span><span> scene </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>await</span><span> figma</span><span>.</span><span>loadScene</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>// gets data from the main thread</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>await</span><span> figma</span><span>.</span><span>updateScene</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>// flush changes back, to the main thread</span></code></pre></div><p>The key thing is that plugins initialize by calling loadScene (which sends a message to Figma to get a copy of the document) and finish by calling updateScene (which sends the changes made by the plugin back to Figma). Note that:  </p><ul><li>We get a copy of the document instead of using message passing for every read and write to a property. Message-passing has overhead on the order of 0.1ms per round-trip, which would only allow for ~1000 messages per second.</li><li>We don’t make plugins use postMessage directly, since it would be cumbersome to work with.</li></ul><p>We went with this approach and built it for about a month. We even invited some alpha testers. However, it soon became clear that there were two major flaws with this approach.</p><h3 id="problem-1-async-await-is-not-user-friendly"><a href="#problem-1-async-await-is-not-user-friendly">Problem #1: async/await is not user friendly</a></h3><p>The first feedback we got is that people were having trouble with having to use async/await. In this approach, it is unavoidable. Message-passing is fundamentally an asynchronous operation, and there’s no way in JavaScript to make a synchronous, blocking call to an asynchronous operation. At the very least, you need the <code>await</code> keyword which also requires marking all calling functions <code>async</code>. All things considered, async/await is still a fairly new JavaScript feature that requires some non-trivial understanding of concurrency. This is a problem, because we expect many of our plugin developers to be designers who may be comfortable with JavaScript, but may not have formal CS education.</p><p>Now, if it were only necessary to use <code>await</code> once at the beginning of the plugin and once at the end, it wouldn’t be so bad. We would just tell developers to always use <code>await</code> with <code>loadScene</code> and <code>updateScene</code> even if they don’t quite understand what it does.</p><p>The problem is that some API calls require a lot of complex logic to run. Changing a single property on a layer sometimes cause multiple layers to update. For example, resizing a frame can recursively apply constraints to its children.</p><p>These behaviors are often complex and nuanced algorithms. It would be a bad idea to re-implement them again for plugins. That logic is also in our compiled WebAssembly binary, so it’s not easy to reuse. And if we don’t run that logic inside the plugin sandbox, plugins will be reading stale data.</p><p>So while this is manageable:</p><div><pre><code><span>await</span><span> figma</span><span>.</span><span>loadScene</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>

For example, on Microsoft’s design systems file (which we spent a month optimizing last year), it took 14 seconds just to serialize the document and send it to the plugin, <em>before the plugin could even run</em>. Given that most plugins are going to involve quick actions like “swap two items in my selection”, this would make plugins unusable.</p><p><em>Loading the data incrementally or lazily also isn’t really an option, because: </em></p><ol><li>It would involve months of re-architecting the core product.</li><li>Any API that may need to wait on a piece of data that hasn’t arrived yet will now be asynchronous.</li></ol><p>In summary, because Figma documents can have really large amount of data with a lot of interdependencies, the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> wasn’t going to work for us.</p><h2 id="back-to-the-drawing-board-and-the-main-thread"><a href="#back-to-the-drawing-board-and-the-main-thread">Back to the drawing board, and the main thread</a></h2><p>With the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> approach having been ruled out, we had to backtrack in our research.</p><p>We went back to the drawing board and spent two long weeks discussing a variety of approaches. As the simple solution didn’t work out, we had to give serious consideration to more exotic ideas. There were many — too many to fill the margins of this blog post. </p><p><em>But most approaches had one or more major disqualifying flaws:</em></p><ul><li>Have an API that would be too difficult to use (e.g. accessing the document using a REST API or GraphQL like method)</li><li>Depends on browser features that browser vendors have removed or are trying to (e.g. synchronous xhr + service worker, shared buffers)</li><li>Requires significant research work or re-architecting of our application that could take months before we can even validate that it can work (e.g. load a copy of Figma in an iframe + sync via CRDTs, hack green threads into JavaScript with generators by cross-compiling)</li></ul><p>At the end of the day, we concluded that we had to find a way to create a model where plugins can directly manipulate the document. Writing a plugin should feel like a designer automating their actions. So we knew we’d have to allow plugins to run on the main thread.</p><h3 id="implications-of-running-on-the-main-thread"><a href="#implications-of-running-on-the-main-thread">Implications of running on the main thread</a></h3><p>Before we dive into Attempt #2, we need to take a step back and re-examine what it means to allow plugins to run on the main thread. After all, we didn’t consider it at first because we knew that it could be dangerous. Running on the main thread sounds an awful lot like <code>eval(UNSAFE_CODE)</code>.</p><p><em>The benefits of running on the main thread are that plugins can:</em></p><ol><li>Directly edit the document rather than a copy of it, eliminating loading time issues.</li><li>Run our complex component updating and constraints logic without needing to have two copies of that code.</li><li>Make synchronous API calls in situations where you’d expect a synchronous API. There would be no confusion with loading or flushing updates.</li><li>Be written in a more intuitive way: plugins are just automating actions that the user would otherwise do manually using our UI.</li></ol><p><em>However, now we have these problems:</em></p><ol><li>Plugins can hang, and there is no way to interrupt a plugin.</li><li>Plugins can make network requests as figma.com.</li><li>Plugins can access and modify global state. This includes modifying our UI, creating dependencies on internal application state outside the API, or doing downright malicious things like changing the value of <code>({}).__proto__</code>  which poisons every new and existing JavaScript object.</li></ol><p>We decided that we could drop the requirement for (1). When plugins freeze, it affects the perceived stability of Figma. However, our plugin model works such that they are only ever run on explicit user action. By changing the UI when a plugin runs, freezes would always be attributed to the plugin. It also means that it is not possible for a plugin to “break” a document.</p><h3 id="what-does-it-mean-for-to-be-dangerous"><a href="#what-does-it-mean-for-to-be-dangerous">What does it mean for  to be dangerous?</a></h3><p>To deal with the issue of plugins being able to make network requests and access global state, we must first understand exactly what it means that “eval arbitrary JavaScript code is dangerous”.</p><p>If a variant of JavaScript, let’s call it SimpleScript, had only the ability to do arithmetic such  <code>7 * 24 * 60 * 60</code>, it would be quite safe to <code>eval</code>.</p><p>You can add some features to SimpleScript like variable assignment and if statements to make it more like a programming language, and it would still be very safe. At the end of the day, it still essentially boils down to doing arithmetic. Add function evaluation, and now you have lambda calculus and Turing completeness.</p><p>In other words, JavaScript doesn’t <em>have</em> to be dangerous. In its most reductionist form, it’s merely an extended way of doing arithmetics. What <em>is</em> dangerous is when it has access to input &amp; output. This includes network access, DOM access, etc. It’s <strong>Browser APIs</strong> that are dangerous.</p><p>And APIs are all global variables. So hide the global variables!</p><h3 id="hiding-the-global-variables"><a href="#hiding-the-global-variables">Hiding the global variables</a></h3><p>Now, hiding the global variables sounds good in theory, but it’s difficult to create secure implementations by merely “hiding” them. You might consider, for example, removing all properties on the <code>window</code> object, or setting them to <code>null</code>, but the code could still get access to global values such as <code>({}).constructor</code>. It would be very challenging to find all the possible ways in which some global value might leak.</p><p>Rather, we need some stronger form of sandboxing where those global values never existed in the first place.</p><div><blockquote><p>In other words, JavaScript doesn’t have to be dangerous. </p></blockquote></div><p>Consider the previous example of a hypothetical SimpleScript that only supports arithmetic. It’s a straightforward CS 101 exercise to write an arithmetic evaluation program. In any reasonable implementation of this program, SimpleScript would simply be unable to do anything other than arithmetic.</p><p>Now, expand SimpleScript to support more language features until it becomes JavaScript, and this program is called an <strong>interpreter</strong>, which is how JavaScript, a dynamic interpreted language, is run.</p><h2 id="attempt-2-compile-a-javascript-interpreter-to"><a href="#attempt-2-compile-a-javascript-interpreter-to">Attempt #2: Compile a JavaScript interpreter to WebAssembly</a></h2><p>Implementing JavaScript is too much work for a small startup like ours. Instead, to validate this approach, we took <a href="https://github.com/svaarala/duktape">Duktape</a>, a lightweight JavaScript interpreter written in C++ and compiled it to WebAssembly.</p><p>To confirm that it works, we ran <a href="https://github.com/tc39/test262/tree/es5-tests">test262</a> on it, the standard JavaScript test suite. It passes all ES5 tests except for a few unimportant test failures. To run plugin code with Duktape, we would call the <code>eval</code> function of <em>the compiled interpreter</em>.</p><p><em>What are the properties of this approach?</em> </p><ul><li>This interpreter runs in the main thread, which means we can create a main-thread based API.</li><li>It’s secure in a way that’s easy to reason about. Duktape does not support any browser APIs — and that’s a feature! Furthermore, it runs as WebAssembly which itself is a sandboxed environment that has no access to browser APIs. In other words, plugin code can communicate with the outside world only through explicit whitelisted APIs by default.</li><li>It’s slower than regular JavaScript since this interpreter is not a JIT, but that’s ok.</li><li>It requires the browser to compile a medium-size WASM binary, which has some cost.</li><li>Browser debugging tools don’t work by default, but we spent a day implementing a console for the interpreter to validate that it’d be at least possible to debug plugins.</li><li>Duktape only supports ES5, but it’s already common practice in the web community to cross-compile newer JavaScript versions using tools such as <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>.</li></ul><p>(Aside: a few months later, Fabrice Bellard released <a href="https://bellard.org/quickjs/">QuickJS</a> which supports ES6 natively.)</p><p>Now, compiling a JavaScript interpreter! Depending on your inclinations or aesthetics as a programmer, you might either think:</p><p>THIS IS AWESOME! 🤩 </p><p>or</p><p>…really? A JavaScript engine in a browser that <em>already has a JavaScript engine?</em> 🤨. What next, an operating system in a browser?</p><p>And some amount of suspicion is healthy! It is best to avoid re-implementing the browser unless we absolutely have to. We already spent a lot of effort <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/">implementing an entire rendering system</a>. It was necessary for performance and cross-browser support and are glad we did it, but we still try to not re-invent the wheel.</p><p><strong>This is not the approach we ended up going with.</strong> There’s an even better approach. However, it was important to cover as a step towards understanding our final sandboxing model which is more complicated.</p><h2 id="attempt-3-realms"><a href="#attempt-3-realms">Attempt #3: Realms</a></h2><p>While we had a promising approach compiling a JS interpreter, there was one more tool to look at. We found a technology called the <a href="https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms">Realms shim</a> created by the folks at <a href="https://agoric.com">Agoric</a>.</p><p>This technology describes creating a sandbox and supporting plugins as a potential use case. A promising description! The Realms API looks roughly like this:</p><div><pre><code><span>let</span><span> g </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>window</span><span>;</span><span> </span><span>// outer global</span><span>

One aspect of the sandbox is to hide the globals. The core of how this shim does that looks roughly like this:</p><div><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>simplifiedEval</span><span>(</span><span>scopeProxy</span><span>,</span><span> userCode</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>This is a simplified version for presentation purposes; there are a few more nuances in the real version. However, it showcases key pieces of the puzzle: the <code>with</code> statement and the Proxy object.</p><p>The <code>with (obj)</code> statement creates a scope where variable lookups can be resolved using the properties of <code>obj</code>. In this example, we can resolve the variables <code>PI</code>, <code>cos</code> and <code>sin</code> as properties of the <code>Math</code> object. On the other hand, <code>console</code> is not a property of <code>Math</code> and gets resolved from the global scope.</p><div><pre><code><span>with</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>Math</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></div><p><strong>Proxy objects</strong> are the most dynamic form of JavaScript objects.</p><ul><li>The most basic JavaScript object returns a value on a property access <code>obj.x</code>.</li><li>The more advanced JavaScript object can have <code>getter</code> properties that returns the result of evaluating a function. The access <code>obj.x</code> calls the getter for <code>x</code>.</li><li>Proxies by running a function <code>get</code> to evaluate any property accesses.</li></ul><p>The proxy below (also simplified for presentation purposes) will return <code>undefined</code> when trying to access <strong>any</strong> property on it, other than the ones in the object <code>whitelist</code>.</p><div><pre><code><span>const</span><span> scopeProxy </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>Proxy</span><span>(</span><span>whitelist</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

It is created by respected members of the web community.</p><p>However, using Realms isn’t the end of the story, since it’s simply a sandbox in which plugins wouldn’t be able to do anything. We still need to implement APIs that the plugin can use. Those APIs will need to be secure too, as most plugins do need to be able to show some UI and make network requests to be useful (e.g. populate a design with data from Google Sheets).</p><p>Consider, for example, that the sandbox does not contain a <code>console</code> object by default.

Plugins can create an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> (which we show inside the Figma editor as a modal) and put any arbitrary HTML and Javascript in it.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78c70ac651eeca4776af923c21e58fff99de0206-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78c70ac651eeca4776af923c21e58fff99de0206-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78c70ac651eeca4776af923c21e58fff99de0206-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78c70ac651eeca4776af923c21e58fff99de0206-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78c70ac651eeca4776af923c21e58fff99de0206-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The difference with our original attempt at using <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>s is that now, the plugin is made of two components:</p><ul><li>The part that can access the Figma document and runs on the main thread, inside a Realms sandbox.</li><li>The part that can access browser APIs and runs inside an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>.</li></ul><p>These two parts of can communicate with each other via message passing. This architecture makes using browser APIs a little more tedious than if we could run both parts in the same environment. However, it is the best we are able to do given current browser technologies, and it has not prevented developers from creating amazing plugins in the two months since we opened the beta.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2><p>We may have taken a winding journey to get here, but ultimately we were excited to find a viable solution for implementing plugins in Figma. The Realm shim allowed us to isolate third-party code while still letting it run in a familiar browser-like environment.</p><p>While this is the best solution for us, it may not be the right approach for every company or platform. If you need to isolate third-party code, it’s worth evaluating if you have the same performance and API ergonomic concerns as we did. If not, isolating code via iframes may be sufficient, and simple is always good. We would have liked to stay simple!</p><p>Ultimately we cared deeply about the final user experience — both that users of plugins would find them stable and reliable, <em>and</em> that developers with basic Javascript knowledge would be able to build them. Fulfilling those accessibility and quality values made all the time we spent trying to get this right worth it.</p><p>One of the most exciting things about working on the engineering team for a browser-based design tool is that we encounter a lot of uncharted territory, and we get to create new ways of handling technical challenges like this.

      <description>Tackle accessibility challenges color contrast and keyboard navigation as part of your design process in Figma with 4 useful plugins.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Failing to thoroughly address accessibility in your design means a large demographic of users may be excluded from being able to use your product. Just specifying the right colors so that text has enough contrast, or providing a way for users to navigate your site with a keyboard can make all the difference in enabling them to use your product too. <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a> (Web Content AccessibilityGuidelines) publishes and maintains standards for creating accessible on-screen experiences and is a great resource to learn more. To meet these needs while working in Figma, there is a growing collection of accessibility-focused plugins to help you tackle these challenges in your own designs. In this weeks plugin-round up, we&#39;ll take a closer look at some helpful plugins to help you make your designs better for everyone.</p><p>Let&#39;s start with color contrast. An important part of choosing the right color parings between text and the surfaces/backgrounds they reside on, is ensuring there is enough contrast so that the text is legible and readable by users with varying levels of vision. These plugins will help you identify if particular color combinations meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast">WCAG AA or AAA</a> standards. Each of these has their own unique features and user-interface, so feel free try them both to see which one works best for you.</p><h2 id="able"><a href="#able">Able</a></h2><p>Creator: <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/user/582151016051772491/">Sondre Kvam</a></p><figure></figure><p>Able is plugin designed to check color contrast—it will analyze the color of any two objects that you have selected. One feature that I like most about this plugin is that it updates as you change your selection. The plugin also takes your colors and gives you a text/background preview and an option that enables you to simulate what those colors will look like through the lens of different types of color blindnesses. And, you can swap the colors between the text and background color. As a bonus, in the menu to select a type of color blindness to simulate, you’ll see a data point by each that indicates what percentage of the population is affected by each type of color deficiency.</p><h2 id="contrast-checker"><a href="#contrast-checker">Contrast Checker</a></h2><p>Creator: <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/user/582151016051772491/">Stark</a></p><figure></figure><p>If you&#39;re coming from Sketch, you may already recognize this one. Stark displays the contrast ratio for any two objects that you select. It also gives you a contextual preview depending on whether or not one of your layers is a text layer or not. The plugin also displays a breakdown of your selected colors at both AA/AA+ and AAA/AAA+ ratings to show different levels of contrast ratios and a rating for if the font size used is over 18pts.</p><h2 id="color-blind"><a href="#color-blind">Color Blind</a></h2><p>Creator: <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/user/680883307046421033/">Sam Mason de Caires</a>, UX Engineer at Cloudflare </p><figure></figure><p>Color Blind is a plugin designed to help you understand how your colors will look from the perspective of different types of color blindness. One of the unique things about this plugin is that it doesn&#39;t just give you a preview of the colors you have chosen, but actually generates visuals on canvas based on whatever elements you have selected. The plugin will create duplicates of your design and change the colors to reflect each type of vision in an appropriately named group.</p><h2 id="focus-orderer"><a href="#focus-orderer">Focus Orderer</a></h2><p>Creator: Tiffany Chen, UX designer at Microsoft</p><figure></figure><p>Shifting gears from colors, let’s move on to Focus Orderer. Focus Ordered lets designers annotate their designs to indicate where and what order the browser should change the focus to. With this plugin, you can select an element and use the plugin to create a focal point. If you need to change the order of the focus, you can do it all in the plugin UI by dragging to change their order and Focus Orderer will take care of renumbering them all on canvas. You can also use the plugin to test and tab through all the elements as well. This is a great way to treat accessibility as a first-class citizen during your design to implementation process.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="CNKuEWrR2j3s" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>We hope that these accessibility plugins find a place in your Figma workflow. Stay tuned next week for another round up of useful plugins, and if you missed last weeks, be sure to check out our post on <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/five-utility-plugins-to-speed-up-your-workflow/">5 helpful utility plugins.</a></p><p>P.S: If you&#39;re thinking of developing your own plugin, be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/intro/">Plugin API documentation</a> to learn how to get started. There is also an online Slack community of plugin developers to connect with, too! If developing your own plugin feels intimidating, remember you can launch the console in Figma and try a few commands to get a feel for how it works. If you&#39;ve ever used Javascript to interact with the DOM on a website, interacting with the Figma canvas works almost the same.</p><figure></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to wireframe</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-wireframe/</link>
      <description>Learn when to create a wireframe, what goes into them, and how they can help you communicate and iterate on ideas with your team.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wireframes are one of the simplest tools you can use to convey a big idea. But the value of a wireframe goes much further than simply getting your idea down on paper or <a href="https://www.figma.com/wireframe-tool/">down in Figma</a>. In this post, we’ll look at what defines a wireframe, what a good wireframe does and does not include, when a wireframe is most helpful, and how you can easily get started wireframing.</p><h2 id="what-is-a-wireframe"><a href="#what-is-a-wireframe">What is a wireframe</a></h2><p>A wireframe is a simple visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website or digital product. Think of it as the blueprint for your final design. You’re providing enough detail so that everyone knows the shape of the wall, but you’re not getting so deep into it that you’re giving exact details on the type of brick the walls should be made of (that comes later). Though wireframes are most often created by designers, they need to be basic enough so that everyone from other designers, stakeholders, devs, and users can understand the ideas. </p><p>Wireframes are not the time to set anything in stone. In fact, the opposite. The power of wireframes is that they provide an opportunity to gather more information through usability research and stakeholder input. Because wireframes are so simple, people can more easily focus on functionality and the user experience rather than getting hung up on colors and other aesthetic elements. </p><h2 id="types-of-wireframes"><a href="#types-of-wireframes">Types of wireframes</a></h2><p>In a traditional design process, wireframes come after on-the-fly hand-drawn sketches and right before high-fidelity mockups or prototypes. There are two levels of wireframing, low fidelity and high fidelity — though you can go straight from a low fidelity wireframe to a prototype and skip high fidelity wireframing as a distinct step.</p><h3 id="low-fidelity-wireframing"><a href="#low-fidelity-wireframing">Low fidelity wireframing</a></h3><p>Low fidelity is the most basic type of wireframing. It’s so simplistic, that paper and pen will still suffice as a way to represent your ideas, however, creating your wireframes in Figma will allow you to easily share them and make sure your team has access to your latest thinking as you iterate. Low fidelity wireframes are done in grayscale with a focus on layout and high-level interactions. UI elements and content are represented by basic shapes like squares, triangles, circles, and lines.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f0ec70acead2ddd5c5c52f876fa0713bae07d003-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Low fidelifty wireframes utilize basical shapes to communicate page structure and layout.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="high-fidelity-wireframing"><a href="#high-fidelity-wireframing">High fidelity wireframing</a></h3><p>High fidelity wireframing takes what you put together in the low fidelity stage and sprinkles in more of the detailed elements. High fidelity wireframes include visual markers and branding signifiers like colors, graphics, and font style. UI elements look realistic and might even include textures and shadows. At this stage, a designer might also choose to add in images and copy. This <a href="https://www.figma.com/templates/wireframe-kits/">wireframing kit</a> will get you started with all the basics you need to create great looking high fidelity wireframes.</p><p>To duplicate the above file, <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/GBCGqs11KNeUyPksQzEMw0hr/Wireframing/duplicate">click here</a>. </p><h2 id="best-practices-for-creating-wireframes"><a href="#best-practices-for-creating-wireframes">Best practices for creating wireframes</a></h2><p>There are no hard and fast rules for what you need to include in your wireframe and what you must leave out, but there are some best practices to help you get the most out of your work. </p><h3 id="keep-aesthetic-elements-simple"><a href="#keep-aesthetic-elements-simple">Keep aesthetic elements simple</a></h3><p>Colors should be grayscale: white, black, and the grays in between.</p><h3 id="use-two-fonts-max"><a href="#use-two-fonts-max">Use two fonts max</a></h3><p>At this stage you are using typography to communicate the hierarchy of information. Limit yourself to two fonts to make the hierarchy clear. Change the font size and use bold and italic as needed to differentiate and call attention to different pieces of information in your wireframe. </p><h3 id="represent-graphics-and-images-with-boxes"><a href="#represent-graphics-and-images-with-boxes">Represent graphics and images with boxes</a></h3><p>Keep the focus on the layout by using simple symbols that relay the future placement of graphics and images. Call out video placements with a triangle as a play button on applicable boxes. Image placement can be represented as squares or rectangles with Xs through them.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b97a498c569597f2afeb3d1800e59e7c9746c85a-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b97a498c569597f2afeb3d1800e59e7c9746c85a-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b97a498c569597f2afeb3d1800e59e7c9746c85a-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b97a498c569597f2afeb3d1800e59e7c9746c85a-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b97a498c569597f2afeb3d1800e59e7c9746c85a-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b97a498c569597f2afeb3d1800e59e7c9746c85a-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>How to represent videos and images in a wireframe.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="consider-screen-size"><a href="#consider-screen-size">Consider screen size</a></h3><p>Wireframes should be equally creative and technical. Consider the many different places, stages, and ways your design might be used. Three questions that might drastically influence your wireframe or versions of your wireframe include:</p><p><strong>Supported devices</strong> — Your design adapts to support desktop and mobile. You’ll want to wireframe how the design changes in each instance. </p><p><strong>Screen orientation</strong> — Depending on if you’re looking at the design in portrait or landscape, some things might need to shift and resize.</p><p><strong>Context of use</strong> — If a specific feature in your product is more geared to desktop use, consider cutting it from the mobile version upfront. Reducing the design to match how people will actually use it saves a lot of time and money.</p><h2 id="when-to-use-a-wireframe"><a href="#when-to-use-a-wireframe">When to use a wireframe</a></h2><p>There’s almost no wrong time to use a wireframe, but there are some instances when they can be extra helpful. Whether you’re trying to explain your idea to someone, get all the stakeholders on the same page, force a group decision, or validate your plan, a wireframe presents a simple visual representation that everyone can point to. </p><p><strong>Get stakeholders to focus</strong> — Because the magic of a wireframe lies in the simplicity, your clients, colleagues, and execs won’t get hung up on downstream details like colors and images. Instead, they’ll be forced to zero in on important structural elements. </p><p><strong>Catch problems early</strong> — Though they don’t present the actual functionality of a page, wireframes allow you to map out how all the elements will look and interact once the design is put into a working prototype. It’s way easier to re-work part of a wireframe than it is to rebuild a prototype or web application. </p><p><strong>Cut down on revision time</strong> — Related to catching problems early, putting an idea in front of the team or a client in a wireframe gives everyone the opportunity to chime in at a time when it’s relatively easy to adjust and revise. By getting collective feedback early, you’ll cut down on revision time later. </p><p><strong>Decide content prioritization</strong> — Wireframes naturally reveal space constraints and the hierarchy of elements on the page, without relying on the content itself. Seeing the elements laid out anonymously will help everyone decide if the right weight is given to the most important content. </p><p><strong>Test usability with users</strong> — When you’re testing out a new idea with someone, they don’t need to see every little detail for you to determine if the idea is going to work. Wireframes give you just enough to work with so that you can validate your approach or pinpoint where adjustments are needed.</p><h2 id="wireframing-in-figma"><a href="#wireframing-in-figma">Wireframing in Figma</a></h2><p>Some designers like to continue sketching wireframes by hand using a blank sheet of computer paper, or dot grid journals. For those that want to jump into designing on-screen, Figma has a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/GBCGqs11KNeUyPksQzEMw0hr/Wireframing/duplicate">wireframe template</a> to get you started. Figma is browser-based, so sharing your wireframes is as easy as sharing a link. Your team can leave comments right on the file so you can easily get feedback and field questions. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3124414e1870effdaf19b2ffeb35a0bcc2f937e6-1500x732.png?w=670&amp;h=327&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3124414e1870effdaf19b2ffeb35a0bcc2f937e6-1500x732.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3124414e1870effdaf19b2ffeb35a0bcc2f937e6-1500x732.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3124414e1870effdaf19b2ffeb35a0bcc2f937e6-1500x732.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3124414e1870effdaf19b2ffeb35a0bcc2f937e6-1500x732.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3124414e1870effdaf19b2ffeb35a0bcc2f937e6-1500x732.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Your wireframe is the blueprint for what happens next in the process. Once it’s in a good place, add in the content and copy and keep building from there. Eventually, what started as a line drawing will become a fully functioning product.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>5 utility plugins to speed up your workflow</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/five-utility-plugins-to-speed-up-your-workflow/</link>
      <description>Check out these new plugins and see how you can start working more efficiently.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Following last week&#39;s <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-plugins/">launch of plugins</a>, we have seen an overwhelming influx of amazing submissions from plugin developers around the world. They have been created to help improve workflows ranging from asset and data population to addressing accessibility requirements. There have also been a great number of, what I like to refer to as, &#34;utility plugins&#34; created. These plugins execute useful actions that accelerate repetitive tasks. In this post I&#39;ll showcase some of the most interesting and useful plugins in this category, and demonstrate how you can use them in your workflow. Also, be sure to check in next week for another round up!</p><h2 id="viewports"><a href="#viewports">Viewports</a></h2><p>Creator: <a href="https://twitter.com/rojcyk">Denis Rojcyk</a>, Digital Product Designer, <a href="https://www.kiwi.com">kiwi.com</a>  </p><figure></figure><p><a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/732240841094697441/Viewports/">Viewports</a> is a really useful plugin for changing the size of your frame to various common device sizes. You&#39;ll need to setup <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/54-constraints">constraints</a> on your elements first, then you can launch Viewports and use it to see how your mockup will look in the selected frame size. One of the most useful aspects to this plugin, is that for each frame size, it shows you the estimated global marketshare of of users browsing content from a specific device. This is really helpful to understand how prevalent certain viewport sizes are. Word on the street is Denis is expanding this to include desktop devices in a future release. Good news, you&#39;ll have those features when they ship since there is no need to update your plugins in Figma!</p><h2 id="component-cloner"><a href="#component-cloner">Component Cloner</a></h2><p>Creator: <a href="https://github.com/katekaho">Kate Miller</a>, Computer Science student UC Santa Cruz  </p><figure></figure><p>Have you ever wanted to make a copy of a master component that is not an instance? Or make a copy of a master component and all of its instances? <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/736564662640346811/Component-Cloner/">Component Cloner</a> has you covered. This plugin will make a copy of any master component and instances that you have selected. It&#39;s been a great time saver in my own work. Take this use case: You have an icon component, and want to see what it looks like with a number of color overrides. Or perhaps you are building an icon sprite.

Perhaps you also need to sort those items alphabetically or reverse their order? <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/739048247603902878/Nisa-Text-Splitter/">Nisa Text Splitter</a> will remove the tediousness of this process. Simply input or paste your text into a new text box and launch Nisa Text Splitter. Then you can use it to split the text into a separate text box at each line break. Following that, you can use the plugin (or <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/189-smart-selection">Smart Selections</a>) re-order them. In the event you want to merge multiple text boxes into one, there is also a join function to accomplish this.</p><h2 id="find-and-replace"><a href="#find-and-replace">Find and Replace</a></h2><p>Creator: <a href="https://twitter.com/jackiechuichui">Jackie Chui</a>, UX Designer at Microsoft  </p><figure></figure><p>Next we&#39;ll take a look at <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/plugin/735072959812183643/Find-and-Replace/">Find and Replace</a>; Jackie has been extending Figma before Figma Plugins were even a thing. What started off as a browser extension has now been developed into a fully featured plugin. As you may have guessed, it enables you to find text across your document, and replace it. This plugin does however have a few additional tricks up its sleeve: in addition to replacing text strings on canvas you can also find and replace layers by name. Both operations support case-sensitivity and allow you to indicate where in the string you want to make the substitution: anywhere in the text, the beginning, the end, or only strings that match exactly. There is no shortage of use cases where this will come in handy, and the copywriters on your team will love it!</p><h2 id="similayer"><a href="#similayer">Similayer</a></h2><p>Creator: David Williames, Senior Product Designer for the Australia Post app  </p><figure></figure><p>You may already be familiar with some of David&#39;s work on Sketch plugins, and he has now already released <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/user/319620268789179331/">6 for Figma!</a> There is no shortages of use-cases for Similayer—this plugin will make a selection from whatever parameters you select. If you have ever used Figma&#39;s native &#34;Select all with same ____&#34; functions from the Edit menu, you can already get a sense of how this plugin works. Simply select an element, launch Similayer, and add the parameters you want to find a match for. For example: you could use this to find all elements with the same border radius, or all elements with the same fill, stroke, border radius, and drop shadow! This plugin will save you MANY clicks the next time you need to edit a bunch of similar layers.</p><h2 id="bonus-tip"><a href="#bonus-tip">Bonus tip:</a></h2><p>You can press <code>⌘ + /</code> (Mac) or <code>*ctrl + /*</code> (Windows) to open and shift focus to the menu search.

Alternatively, to run the previous plugin you can use the shortcut <code>⌘ + ⌥ + P</code> (Mac) or <code>Ctrl + Alt + P</code> (Windows).</p><figure></figure><p>We hope that these time-saving plugins find a place in your Figma workflow.

      <description>How the new open source typeface used by GitHub and Mozilla came to be</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It takes a lot of work to invent a typeface. Figma designer <a href="https://twitter.com/rsms">Rasmus Andersson</a> learned that first hand while creating <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> — a font meant to make it easier to read text on computer screens.</p><p>Rasmus came up with the idea for Inter in his work on Figma. We&#39;d used Roboto (designed by <a href="https://christianrobertson.com/">Christian Robertson</a> for Google) as our main font for years, and we were running up against its limitations. It was originally built to work as both a display typeface (for things like titles) and text typeface (for longer blocks like paragraphs). But it was difficult to read Roboto when it was small (small text makes up much of the typography in Figma&#39;s UI).</p><p>Rasmus and the design team did a month-long research project to find a better-suiting option, but Roboto still came out on top and we stuck with it for several years.</p><p>This experience got Rasmus thinking about text-heavy UIs and typefaces. He decided to try making his own font, designed solely for computer user interfaces, and offer it for free to the world. He released the first set of glyphs for Inter in August 2017, and he&#39;s been iterating on it continuously ever since.</p><p>We sat down with Rasmus to get more back story on Inter and find out what goes into creating a brand new typeface.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3d65925ea0806bb7a3960913340a2f2661f67532-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="how-much-experience-did-you-have-with-creating"><a href="#how-much-experience-did-you-have-with-creating">How much experience did you have with creating typefaces before Inter?</a></h2><p>Very little. I&#39;d never made a text typeface before. I&#39;d made a couple of hobby typefaces in my own time and a few display typefaces at Spotify. [Editor&#39;s note: Rasmus was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/pda/2010/aug/11/spotify-facebook-rasmus-andersson">first designer at Spotify</a> in 2006]. But none of those were close to the scale of this project.</p><p>When I started this, I didn&#39;t understand how much work it was going to be. If I wanted to do it properly, I figured it was probably going to take a year or something like that.</p><p>It turns out it&#39;s probably more of a five, 10 year project to do it fully.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68e321fc3d7e111ac1b63401c548ccda148f6c89-2919x1015.png?w=670&amp;h=233&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68e321fc3d7e111ac1b63401c548ccda148f6c89-2919x1015.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68e321fc3d7e111ac1b63401c548ccda148f6c89-2919x1015.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68e321fc3d7e111ac1b63401c548ccda148f6c89-2919x1015.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68e321fc3d7e111ac1b63401c548ccda148f6c89-2919x1015.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/68e321fc3d7e111ac1b63401c548ccda148f6c89-2919x1015.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="how-long-did-it-take-you-to-get-to-the-core-set"><a href="#how-long-did-it-take-you-to-get-to-the-core-set">How long did it take you to get to the core set of glyphs?</a></h2><p>How do you define &#39;core set of glyphs&#39;? There are more than 150 different written scripts in the world — at least those that are well-recognized. Only a small portion of them are Latin-based, like what English is. Where capital A looks like A and stuff like that.</p><p>Then, there&#39;s the Greek alphabet which is similar to Latin as well as Cyrillic. Then we have Arabic and Hangul which are very different from Latin typography. Spacing is different, capital letters, lowercase letters, there are so many differences in the fundamental design of things. </p><p>You can probably spend a human lifetime making one typeface family encompassing all of these scripts. </p><h2 id="where-did-you-decide-to-start"><a href="#where-did-you-decide-to-start">Where did you decide to start?</a></h2><p>Because I&#39;m a Latin script kind of person (it&#39;s what I&#39;m familiar with), I focused on that.

The Cyrillic characters and a lot of the Greek characters came from Roboto for a long time. The typeface is dual licensed for this reason. I didn&#39;t anticipate this being so effective, but I found it was a great way to get started.

With a text typeface, you spend most of the time on spacing, pacing, stem thickness and stuff like that, much, much more so than on designing the actual glyphs. You also spend a lot of time on how the characters relate to one another.</p><p>With display type, you usually spend much more time taking care of shaping curves and making the glyphs feel really spot on. Thickness, positioning, stem angles. Details that affect rasterization. Things like that.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="it-also-sounds-like-you-could-go-crazy-because"><a href="#it-also-sounds-like-you-could-go-crazy-because">It also sounds like you could go crazy because you could tweak for infinity. You tweak one thing and it interrupts the rhythm with something else.</a></h2><p>I spent almost three years on this project, and I feel it like I could easily spend three more years. Almost every week I do something on it, even if it&#39;s just 5 minutes replying to a question somewhere.</p><figure><figcaption>Replay of the glyphs “Rag” in every public release of Inter</figcaption></figure><h2 id="who-asks-you-questions-about-inter"><a href="#who-asks-you-questions-about-inter">Who asks you questions about Inter?</a></h2><p>People around the world. I get a lot of emails, tweets, questions about it and stuff like that. There&#39;s always feedback — on how people are using it, what is missing, what could be better.</p><p>For instance, I have redrawn, not all of them, but quite a few of the Cyrillic characters. I&#39;m not a native Cyrillic script person, so I feel that I am struggling a bit with that.</p><p>Someone from Russia found an issue and said, &#34;This particular glyph, it looks totally wrong to me. I&#39;m not used to seeing that.&#34; I asked, &#34;What is the recipe for making it right?&#34; And he&#39;s like, &#34;I don&#39;t really know, but that doesn&#39;t look right.&#34;</p><p>Typography has a lot of these interesting situations in it where a lot of the characters that we&#39;re used to seeing have no definitive shape. A capital T is usually two rectangles together. Right? But, what about a lowercase a? What about an S? There&#39;s not one S that&#39;s identical to another S in a typeface. There are practically infinite variations on these shapes.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c89c9a63c10bdbc475d3ac94f66edd81e5d769cb-2048x192.png?rect=3,0,2042,192&amp;w=670&amp;h=63&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c89c9a63c10bdbc475d3ac94f66edd81e5d769cb-2048x192.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c89c9a63c10bdbc475d3ac94f66edd81e5d769cb-2048x192.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c89c9a63c10bdbc475d3ac94f66edd81e5d769cb-2048x192.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c89c9a63c10bdbc475d3ac94f66edd81e5d769cb-2048x192.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c89c9a63c10bdbc475d3ac94f66edd81e5d769cb-2048x192.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>I started out with <a href="https://robofont.com">RoboFont</a> which is this commercial software. It is a foundation that you expand with plugins, so in order to draw a rectangle in RoboFont, you need a rectangle plugin. It&#39;s a programming-forward platform where you do a lot of work by writing Python scripts.</p><p>For probably historical reasons, or maybe because of the Van Rossum brothers, most—if not all—tooling for typography is <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a>. There are exceptions, but all of the major font editors, they all provide plugin systems and scripting with Python. So, Python it is.</p><h2 id="you-think-that-s-just-because-someone-that-was-an"><a href="#you-think-that-s-just-because-someone-that-was-an">You think that&#39;s just because someone that was an earlier pioneer in creating typefaces on computers loved Python?</a></h2><p>Exactly. No, yeah, there&#39;s nothing inherent about Python that makes it good or bad for typography, whatever. </p><p>A little over a year ago I switched over to <a href="https://glyphsapp.com">Glyphs</a>, which is one of the other popular commercial applications. Again, it also has a plugin system based on Python. It offers great performance and one of the creators, Georg Seifert, seems to be a very nice person. He&#39;s been very responsive in terms of replying to my questions and sending beta builds to address an issue right away, which I think is incredible for being a two-person shop.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e96b5943805502a29f29954f847c167ed4199985-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e96b5943805502a29f29954f847c167ed4199985-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e96b5943805502a29f29954f847c167ed4199985-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e96b5943805502a29f29954f847c167ed4199985-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e96b5943805502a29f29954f847c167ed4199985-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e96b5943805502a29f29954f847c167ed4199985-2048x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Editing in Glyphs</figcaption></figure><h2 id="what-do-you-need-specifically-in-typography"><a href="#what-do-you-need-specifically-in-typography">What do you need specifically in typography designing software that you couldn&#39;t get in Illustrator or something?</a></h2><p>A lot of the work that goes into typography is not about drawing, at least with a text-oriented typeface. Instead, it&#39;s about mechanics, spacing and metadata—the variety of metrics that exist in a typeface which influence how text appears. So there&#39;s some percentage of drawing glyphs and then the rest is a lot of programming, kerning and making many small adjustments while constantly testing the font against various text samples.</p><p>There&#39;s a lot of composition involved, so components is a very common workflow. In these font tools, you say: &#34;This thing with the dots over it composes the A and the dots glyphs.&#34; Now, in the future when I make an adjustment to my A, it adjusts all of those characters that are based on A automatically. You can create these very efficient ways of iterating on the design through use of components.</p><h2 id="it-s-like-figma-components-basically"><a href="#it-s-like-figma-components-basically">It&#39;s like Figma components, basically.</a></h2><p>It is, it works very similarly to <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/66-components">Figma components</a>, actually.

Was that always the plan?</a></h2><p>No. When I started the project, there was a hope that if it was successful it could be used in Figma, but it was not the plan. It took quite a while for our design team to consider it.</p><h2 id="why-did-it-take-a-while"><a href="#why-did-it-take-a-while">Why did it take a while?</a></h2><p>Since I personally work at Figma and Inter is my side project—maybe this is a weird Swedish thing, but—I felt that I couldn&#39;t really propose Inter to be used in Figma at all. I hoped that it could be useful, but I didn&#39;t have much expectation and I certainly didn&#39;t push on it.</p><p>In late 2018, we had a project to do a <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/ui-refresh/">redesign of our UI</a>, and as part of it we evaluated typography in the tool. I kept quiet, but the rest of the team wound up suggesting it. When we tried it out it worked really well.</p><h2 id="what-worked-well-about-it"><a href="#what-worked-well-about-it">What worked well about it?</a></h2><p>A lot of the Figma UI is typography based. We organize information in the UI largely through spacing and typography, and we use text for elements that you might rarely interact with, like menus, or things that are particularly important concepts to understand, like the layers/asset panel labels.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/217c87406cf29045882a112608d8a18c15c82423-2048x1120.png?rect=0,0,2048,1119&amp;w=670&amp;h=366&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/217c87406cf29045882a112608d8a18c15c82423-2048x1120.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/217c87406cf29045882a112608d8a18c15c82423-2048x1120.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/217c87406cf29045882a112608d8a18c15c82423-2048x1120.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/217c87406cf29045882a112608d8a18c15c82423-2048x1120.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/217c87406cf29045882a112608d8a18c15c82423-2048x1120.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>We found Inter to be easier to read in our UI than the alternatives.

      <title>How to run a design sprint</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-run-a-design-sprint/</link>
      <description>Learn how to plan and facilitate the six phases of a design sprint.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The design sprint is one of the most relied upon yet formidable processes a designer goes through. Teams use design sprints for many different reasons like at the start of a new project, when time is on the line, to get a product or team unstuck, or to leverage new data or research. Some teams use design sprints as shortcuts to tackle big problems quickly, while other teams see design sprints as the most effective way to complete any project. The design sprint idea and methodology uses simple prototyping, user research, and user testing to solve complex problems. Since its inception, teams around the world have adopted, amended, expanded, and molded the original design sprint concept to meet their own needs.</p><p>In this post, we’ll look at how design sprints were first created, provide a detailed plan for planning a design sprint, and give you the how-to for running your sprint. </p><h2 id="what-is-a-design-sprint"><a href="#what-is-a-design-sprint">What is a design sprint</a></h2><p>A design sprint is a tried and true methodology for solving big problems through designing, prototyping, and user research and testing. The sprint is set to run for a definite period, usually five business days, so that teams are encouraged to quickly align under a shared vision with defined goals and deliverables. The design sprint follows six phases: Understand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, and Validate.</p><h2 id="google-design-sprint"><a href="#google-design-sprint">Google design sprint</a></h2><p>The design sprint methodology was developed at Google out of a need to build UX culture and design leadership across the organization. The core methodology is inspired by thinking and processes from traditional UX practice, IDEO, the Stanford dSchool, business strategy, and psychology. The modern framework is flexible so that teams in any organization can adapt it to meet their specific needs. </p><h2 id="plan-a-design-sprint"><a href="#plan-a-design-sprint">Plan a design sprint</a></h2><p>Preparing for a design sprint is just as important, if not more important, than the sprint itself. Don’t expect to get it all done in one day. For each day you’re planning to sprint, set aside a day for prep. Planning and preparing properly ensures you’ll get the most out of every moment once you start the sprint. </p><h3 id="write-a-brief"><a href="#write-a-brief">Write a brief</a></h3><p>The sprint brief will act as a guidepost for the team throughout the sprint. It should list your defined goals (the problem or problems you’re solving), deliverables, agenda, and methods. It should also provide the sprint team with background for the project and any user research that’s already available. You don’t want the team to waste any time looking for answers you already have, so be sure to include all relevant details in the sprint brief. </p><p>A design sprint is meant to tackle one big challenge at a time, so your brief should clearly reflect that. Anchor your sprint with one clear question to answer. Instead of “Make our homepage more shoppable,” a better framing is “Redesign a user flow to increase conversion.”</p><h3 id="gather-a-team"><a href="#gather-a-team">Gather a team</a></h3><p>Who should be in the room? Keep groups to five to seven people, and break larger teams into small groups that are all working on the same problem. More people creating and iterating means more ideas and multiple versions of a prototype. </p><p>Your design sprint team must include the people who are responsible for carrying out the work after the sprint. Design sprint teams typically include a UX designer, a user researcher, a product manager, a developer, and key members of leadership.</p><h3 id="create-an-agenda"><a href="#create-an-agenda">Create an agenda</a></h3><p>The simplest way to build your agenda is by following the six phases of methodology—Understand, Define, Sketch, Decide, Prototype, and Validate—but depending on your timeline and goals, you may need to modify to meet your needs. The design sprint team may already have a deep knowledge of the space and problem you’re working on, so you’d want to devote less time to the Understand phase and possibly reallocate the time to prototyping. </p><h3 id="build-visuals"><a href="#build-visuals">Build visuals</a></h3><p>The sprint brief is just one important visual. Whether you choose to put together a deck or another preferred visual, make sure you have all anticipated references at hand. That includes screenshots of current websites, inspiration sources, data, research summaries, and anything else the team might need to know or want to quickly reference throughout the sprint. </p><h3 id="compile-user-research"><a href="#compile-user-research">Compile user research</a></h3><p>Robust user research is what your design sprint team will rely on for clues on how to build a prototype. Without a few hints about what people want, the process could go off the rails fast. Exploratory research before the sprint can help guide new ideas and compiling existing data can help uncover how people are currently using the product, and the changes you might need to make to shape that behavior. This compiled data will help kick off the Understand phase. </p><h3 id="line-up-key-presenters"><a href="#line-up-key-presenters">Line up key presenters</a></h3><p>In addition to the compiled data, you may want to line up key speakers and external experts who can share a fresh perspective on the problem the team is working on. Google’s design sprint methodology calls these Lightning Talks since they’re meant to be a concise presentation lasting between 10-15 minutes. Helpful topics might include a summary of customer research from someone on the support team, competitive audits from an analyst, and a review of product performance from a product manager. You’ll need to reach out to and invite these presenters ahead of time, and be flexible if someone can’t join in person. An audio or video call is perfectly fine; any method that helps get the sprint team all the info they need.</p><h3 id="book-an-ideal-spot"><a href="#book-an-ideal-spot">Book an ideal spot</a></h3><p>A design sprint is all about creativity, so you want your meeting space to reflect that from the moment participants walk in. Find a spot with lots of light that you can make your own. That might mean moving furniture or taking over whiteboard walls. Don’t feel locked to the space for the duration of the sprint either. Break up the week with a field trip to a coffee shop or nearby park.</p><h3 id="line-up-an-ice-breaker"><a href="#line-up-an-ice-breaker">Line up an ice breaker</a></h3><p>An ice breaker is a great way to get everyone comfortable with each other and jumpstart creative thinking. If you don’t already have an idea for a warm up, a simple search will yield tons of options. </p><h3 id="collect-supplies"><a href="#collect-supplies">Collect supplies</a></h3><p>Have all the necessary supplies ready to go before day one of the sprint. You don’t want an awesome idea to get lost because someone didn’t have a pen. Start with the list below and add anything else that might help support your unique design sprint:</p><ul><li>1 Sharpie per person, plus a few more</li><li>1 pad of sticky notes per person</li><li>1 drawing pen per person</li><li>10 sheets of paper per person</li><li>1 roll of tape</li><li>1 pair of scissors</li><li>2 whiteboards or large sticky pads per team</li><li>1 set of colored whiteboard markers</li></ul><h3 id="set-expectations"><a href="#set-expectations">Set expectations</a></h3><p>A few days before the design sprint is set to start, prepare participants and set expectations. Reconfirm everyone who accepted the invitation will, in fact, be participating throughout the sprint. If people are dropping in here and there, the process isn’t nearly as effective. Share the agenda and schedule along with any other special requirements such as turning phones off.</p><h2 id="run-a-design-sprint"><a href="#run-a-design-sprint">Run a design sprint</a></h2><p>Again, a design sprint is what you make of it, and what you need to get out of it. Your sprint could last three days instead of five. It might devote just one morning to the Understand phase if participants already have a deep knowledge of the space and problem. Here we’ll cover every phase of the traditional design sprint methodology so you have the full gamut when it comes time to organize your design sprint. </p><h3 id="phase-1-understand"><a href="#phase-1-understand">Phase 1: Understand</a></h3><p>The Understand phase is where all design sprint participants create a shared knowledge base. That base comes from provided info in the brief, Lightning Talks, user interviews, and exercises like Experience Mapping where the team maps out step by step the experience a user has within a problem space or context, and How Might We which encourages the team to reframe pain points as opportunities. <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase1-understand">See Google’s entire compilation of Understand activities here</a>. </p><h3 id="phase-2-define"><a href="#phase-2-define">Phase 2: Define</a></h3><p>In the Define phase, the team uses everything they learned in the Understand phase to zero in on a specific focus for the sprint. They’ll also define goals, success metrics, and signals. One popular Define method is <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase2-define/golden-path">The Golden Path</a>, which requires participants to list out the possible user stories if the product already exists, or if the product does not exist yet, to sketch the ideal path through the new product. <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase2-define">See more Define methods here</a>.</p><h3 id="phase-3-sketch"><a href="#phase-3-sketch">Phase 3: Sketch</a></h3><p>In the Sketch phase, the sprint team individually generates as many ideas as possible. From there, the team works together to narrow down the ideas to one expanded <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase3-sketch/solution-sketch">Solution Sketch</a> per person. One popular exercise is Crazy 8’s, a fast sketching exercise that challenges people to sketch eight different ideas in eight minutes. Check out more of <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase3-sketch">Google’s suggested Sketch methods here</a>. You can also take this activity digital with Figma and have fun watching what everyone comes up with in multiplayer mode. This is also handy if you are running a design sprint with remote teammates.</p><h3 id="phase-4-decide"><a href="#phase-4-decide">Phase 4: Decide</a></h3><p>The Decide phase pushes the design sprint team to land on a final direction that everyone will work to frame up and build out during the rest of the sprint. Dot Vote is a simple exercise that gets to a decision quickly. Everyone gets three minutes to present their solution while the rest of the team can ask questions. Then, with all sketches hung up on the wall, each team member gets three total votes, represented by dot stickers. The sketch with the most stickers becomes the sprint focus. If you’ve already done your Sketch work in Figma, create a Figma component to use for dot votes. Here’s more <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase4-decide">Decide methods to try</a>.</p><h3 id="phase-5-prototype"><a href="#phase-5-prototype">Phase 5: Prototype</a></h3><p>In the Prototype phase, the sprint team works together to create a prototype of the concept. Full product prototypes take a lot of time, but here we’re focused on speed and creating a representation of the solution that’s just detailed enough to get a response from a potential user. This usually means mapping out the exact flow and including only the steps you want to test. You can easily create <a href="https://www.figma.com/prototyping-tool/">prototypes</a> in Figma by simply ordering frames on your screen or linking objects with connectors. If you’re looking for more ways to expand your prototyping skills, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/proto-gp-5-ways-to-level-up-your-prototyping-workflow/">check out these tips</a>. </p><h3 id="phase-6-validate"><a href="#phase-6-validate">Phase 6: Validate</a></h3><p>In the final phase, the sprint team will use their prototype to conduct user research. Crucial notes during this process include user feedback and stakeholder and technical feasibility reviews. The sprint will end with a validated concept or a concept that still needs improvements, but comes with helpful feedback notes. Validating is all about getting the prototype in front of users, but there are <a href="https://designsprintkit.withgoogle.com/methodology/phase6-validate">a few different approaches you can take</a>. </p><p>A design sprint is a kickoff to a larger project, so next steps after a sprint wraps should be clear from the beginning. Project or product managers should be able to provide clear action items to the team members responsible for seeing the project through. During the sprint, be sure to take ample notes and photos of the team’s work so that you can provide everyone with a complete summary of the process afterward.</p><p>Sprints are hard work! End the sprint with a mini celebration to help the team unwind after several days of intense effort. </p><p>For more support for collaboration, brainstorming, and prototyping, invite <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/">Figma</a> to your design sprint, too. Use Figma as an online collaborative whiteboard; discover, design, prototype, iterate, and comment all in one tool; and get early feedback quickly with the <a href="https://www.figma.com/templates/wireframe-kits/">Figma wireframing kit</a>.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="ob3yp7Nx0scq" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><h2 id="additional-resources"><a href="#additional-resources">Additional Resources:</a></h2><ul><li>GV&#39;s, <a href="https://www.gv.com/sprint/">The Design Sprint</a></li><li>IDEO&#39;s, <a href="https://www.ideo.com/blog/5-tips-for-running-a-successful-design-sprint">5 Tips for Running a Successful Design Sprint</a></li></ul></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Automate work. Bring in real data. Extend what’s possible with Figma Plugins.</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-plugins/</link>
      <description>We&#39;re excited to introduce plugins to the entire Figma community. Today, the gates are open for anyone to use plugins built by our community and build your own plugins tailored to your workflow.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m excited to introduce plugins to the entire Figma community, alongside hundreds of creators who’ve built and published plugins during <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/plugins-are-coming-to-figma/">our beta</a>. Today, the gates are open for anyone to use these <a href="https://www.figma.com/c/">plugins built by our community</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugin-docs/">build your own plugins</a> tailored to your workflow. </p><p>I’ve spent the majority of my professional career working on tools that allow other people to create things. Empowering other people to be creative is fun for me, and working on extensibility architectures is an even more fun version of that. </p><p>Plugins were always in our future at Figma, but we wanted to do things differently with our platform architecture. Plugins are critical components to a designer’s workflow that can serve as little power-ups and help extend Figma’s product functionality. However, as important as they are, design plugins to date have not yet met the call of duty. We saw two primary problems:</p><ol><li>Although designers rely on plugins, design plugins are not always reliable or secure. This is because they’re often built on not fully-supported APIs.</li><li>Designers are at the mercy of others to build plugins for them, unless they themselves know how to code. And getting engineering resources is never easy.</li></ol><p>Fortunately, I got to work with super talented engineers and powerhouse plugin developers from our community to help figure out these challenges. We wanted our plugins to be secure, stable, and performant, of course. But we also wanted Figma plugin programming to feel like web programming. Our internal motto is: “If you can code a webpage with basic HTML and JavaScript, you can build a Figma plugin.” </p><p>It turns out that there were a lot of technical challenges to make this happen (which we will cover in a later engineering blog post). We also had to figure out—for the first time in the design tooling space—what a plugin architecture looked like for a web-based platform. But in architecting our plugins platform in this manner, our hope was that these upfront investments would allow more plugin creators to build more creative, interesting plugins</p><div><blockquote><p>Figma plugins make it easy to advocate for myself and others by giving me the ability to create the design tools we need, rather than crossing our fingers and hoping someone else will make them for us.</p></blockquote><div><p>— Tiffany Chen, UX Designer at Microsoft</p></div></div><p>After just 6 weeks in beta, we now have over 40 public plugins available to the Figma community—with more added every day. You can browse all plugins right in the Figma product. Installing a plugin takes one click. In your design file, just right click to pull up all the available plugins.</p><figure></figure><p>For customers on the <a href="https://www.figma.com/organization/">Figma Organization</a> plan, you can also build and distribute private plugins to all the users at your company. Admins can even curate a list of plugins their users have access to and install plugins on their behalf.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e6fecbdfd7414b860abaf1123a82bbc02da6fcd2-1966x1286.png?rect=0,0,1966,1285&amp;w=670&amp;h=438&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e6fecbdfd7414b860abaf1123a82bbc02da6fcd2-1966x1286.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e6fecbdfd7414b860abaf1123a82bbc02da6fcd2-1966x1286.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e6fecbdfd7414b860abaf1123a82bbc02da6fcd2-1966x1286.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e6fecbdfd7414b860abaf1123a82bbc02da6fcd2-1966x1286.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e6fecbdfd7414b860abaf1123a82bbc02da6fcd2-1966x1286.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>So, let’s meet some of these plugins, shall we?

      <title>Behind the Plugins: Jackie Chui, UX Designer @ Microsoft</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-plugins-jackie-chui-microsoft/</link>
      <description>Meet Jackie, a Figma API user from the start and Plugins beta user. Check out the useful tools he has been building for Microsoft and the broader community.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Editor&#39;s Note: This article is part 5 of a 5-part series about the creators behind Figma plugins—coming to a Figma near you on August 1, 2019. <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugins-launch-event/">Tune in to watch our live announcement</a>.</em> </p><p>In our final “Behind the Plugins” interview, I’m sitting down with Jackie Chui, UX Designer at Microsoft working on the PowerApps design team. A natural tinkerer, Jackie has been exploring the Figma API ever since we launched <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-platform/">our platform</a> more than a year ago. You may even recognize him as the creator of a community for Figma users to share functionality built with our APIs. Needless to say, Jackie has become a valued partner in our plugins beta program. </p><p>Since joining our beta, he’s been busy building useful tools for Microsoft and the broader community. He’s created so many plugins that we even lost count. As Jackie put it, “I love designing and building tools to help designers work faster and smarter, and hopefully inspire others to do the same.” </p><p>Let’s meet the creator behind the plugins. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="ssOm8a1nl9NU" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><strong>Q: Why did you become a designer/developer?A:</strong> I remember as a kid I always loved building and inventing new things with my LEGOs. Later in life when I stumbled upon UX design, that same passion for building things was reignited. In my journey as a UX designer, I picked up some coding skills along the way, so I can actually build the products I design and see it all come together. </p><p><strong>Q: What do you do to get inspired?A:</strong> I look to what others are doing in the space and try to draw connections between elements of their work into my own projects.</p><p><strong>Q: What Figma plugins are you building?A:</strong> I’m most excited about the Find and Replace plugin I’ve built for the Figma community. </p><figure></figure><p>I’ve also built a Paste to Fill plugin,</p><figure></figure><p>a Button Resizer plugin,</p><figure></figure><p>...and so many more! </p><p><strong>Q: Was this your first time building a plugin? How did you get started?A:</strong> Yes, this is my first time building plugins for any system. It actually all started from the Microsoft OneWeek Hackathon in 2018. My team wanted to do something with building accessibility features into our design tools (we were already using Figma at that time). Since Figma is built on the web, I got curious and started to explore Figma’s platform. After discovering some functions which allowed me to simulate user actions programmatically, I got completely hooked. Every little new function I found opened up a world of possibilities for me. This is why I really appreciate how easy and stable the official API is today.</p><p><strong>Q: What piece of work are you most proud of?A:</strong> Ironically, Figma Plus. </p><p>Initially, I built my first hacky plugin in the form of Chrome extensions that only worked on the browser. After receiving a lot of positive feedback from the community, I realized there was a huge need for the plugin to work on Figma’s desktop app (because that’s where most users do their work). So I teamed up with <a href="https://twitter.com/mirkosantangelo">Mirko Santangelo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cdes">Ahmad Al Haddad</a>, who had also worked on a few plugins, to develop a platform that aggregates our knowledge of the Figma API. All three of us are over-achievers so what started as a small project eventually turned into a complete system with our own API, plugin store, and publishing process. So when Figma officially launched their plugins beta, of course the three of us wanted to be a part of it. </p><p><strong>Q: How do you see the design community evolving over the next 5 years?A:</strong>  Designers and developers will become closer in their workflows, especially as future design tools continue to bridge the gap that exists today. </p><p><strong>Q: Why are you building for the Figma community?A:</strong> Figma has become the primary design tool in Microsoft, so it only makes sense for me to start building on the platform that helps my team&#39;s workflow and expand outward from there. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="uZiQHu3T-Hmw" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>On August 1, Jackie’s plugins will be available to the Figma community. <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugins-launch-event/">Tune in to watch our announcement live</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Behind the Plugins: Matt DesLauriers, Generative Artist &amp; Creative Coder</title>

      <description>Meet Matt, the creator behind three new Figma plugins. See the plugins in action and find out about how he got into making generative art.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Editor&#39;s Note: This article is part 4 of a 5-part series about the creators behind Figma plugins—coming to a Figma near you on August 1, 2019. <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugins-launch-event/">Tune in to watch our live announcement</a>.</em> </p><p>Today’s interview is with generative artist and creative coder Matt DesLauriers. Given Matt’s many contributions to the broader design and art community, it’s no surprise that he has several Figma plugins in the works. </p><p>You may have seen some sneak peeks of Matt’s plugins on Twitter, like this animations plugin that opens up new possibilities:</p><figure></figure><p>And this image palette plugin that suggests color pairings:</p><figure></figure><p>And this parametric design generator: </p><figure></figure><p>Now let’s meet the creator behind the plugins. </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="I_RMO4vdAJpV" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><strong>Q: How did you first get into generative art?A:</strong> I&#39;ve been interested in both art and code since I was young. As a kid, I would spend more time modding, hacking, and re-designing games than actually playing them. I started to learn about generative art in 2014 while making small demos in the browser with JavaScript. Some of the demos would produce images that evolved and changed over time, always producing new and unique imagery. I was really fascinated by the concept of emergence, exploring how complex images and artworks can be produced from a simple set of rules and parameters fed into a computer.</p><p><strong>Q: What piece of work are you most proud of?A:</strong> One of my favourite projects was building <a href="https://vimeo.com/261406016">LUMOS</a>. Along with two friends (Jean-Michel Gariepy and Steven Mengin), we designed and built an interactive light sculpture that was put on public display in Toronto as part of Ontario Place Park&#39;s 2018 Winter Light Exhibition.</p><p><strong>Q: You do a lot of workshops and write a lot about creating art through code. Why is it important to you to bridge art and code?A:</strong> For me, combining code and art feels natural. It becomes a collaboration between me and the computer, where code is a tool—much like a brush or pen—that acts as a bridge between me and the machine. I can lay down instructions, rules, and parameters, and the computer can execute those millions of times in a second without ever tiring. This collaboration helps free my imagination from my own human limitations, and can also produce some surprising and unexpected results that can spawn ideas for new artworks (for example, an error in my code).</p><p><strong>Q: Why are you building plugins for the Figma community?A:</strong> I&#39;m hoping my plugins inspire designers to explore more code, and developers to explore more design. I like to build tools and software that make creative coding and generative art more accessible to coders and non-coders alike.</p><p><strong>Q: Do you have a favorite feature in Figma?A:</strong> It&#39;s the little things—like being able to put math expressions such as &#34;25 / 2&#34; into a Figma number field and have it evaluated.</p><p><strong>Q: What do you think the design industry needs more of?A:</strong> I’d like to see more open, hackable, and experimental tools. I’d also like to see the lines blurring between designers, coders, artists, and other creative fields.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="qGjEPfuDNTRo" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>On August 1, Matt’s plugins will be available to the Figma community. <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugins-launch-event/">Tune in to watch our announcement live</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Behind the Plugins: Yitong Zhang, Product Designer @ Coinbase</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-plugins-yitong-zhang-coinbase/</link>
      <description>Meet Yitong Zhang, Product Designer at Coinbase and Figma plugins beta customer. Find out what he is building with the Figma API.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Editor&#39;s Note: This article is part 3 of a 5-part series about the creators behind Figma plugins—coming to a Figma near you on August 1, 2019. <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugins-launch-event/">Tune in to watch our live announcement</a>.</em> </p><p>In today’s segment of “Behind the Plugins,” I’m sitting down with Yitong Zhang, Product Designer at Coinbase. Yitong joined Coinbase’s design team of 16 to help the digital currency platform create an open financial system for the world. Embarking on this big mission meant that Coinbase’s teams also had to open up their design process to be more inclusive of their partners.</p><p>“If we want better, more ethical, high impact outcomes, we (designers) need to get involved in the early stages of product development.” Yitong says.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="u46_r7wk-vKT" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><strong>Q: Why did you become a designer/developer?A:</strong> I first came into tech as a founder who did a bit of everything. Then my startup died, so I needed a job to pay rent. Being a designer is in some ways a bit like doing my favorite part of being a founder — imagining useful things into existence. It also helped that I already knew design tools from my days of doing fan art of my favorite animes.</p><p><strong>Q: What Figma plugin are you building?A:</strong> I’m working on an auto flow plugin. It&#39;s a plugin that connects any two objects with a line and makes drawing flows really quick and easy. </p><figure></figure><p><strong>Q: Why are you building for the Figma community?A:</strong> It&#39;s fun and the API is really good. Also, I think Figma is the future, so building for anything else seems like a waste of time.</p><p><strong>Q: What’s something work-related you’re most proud of?A:</strong> It sounds cheesy, but I&#39;m proud of the process we&#39;ve built here at Coinbase, moving design from a place of executing on PRDs to an equal partner in creating our strategy.</p><p><strong>Q: What do you think the design industry needs more of?A:</strong> We need more designers to be involved in the definition of the problems we are asked to solve. No matter how hard you try, no good product has come out of a bad problem statement.<br/>If we want better, more ethical, more impact outcomes, we (designers) need to get involved in the early stages of product development.</p><p><strong>Q: How do you see the design community evolving over the next 5 years?A:</strong> For product designers, we&#39;ll have less pixel pushing, and more system building and strategy definition. Brand design will become more important and separate from product design as tech companies realize that brand is a very powerful competitive moat.</p><p><strong>Q: How do you stay inspired?A:</strong> I try to get inspired from fields that are as far away from my own as possible. Lately, I&#39;ve been working on a lot of systems-level design work, so looking into architecture has been fun.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="gx4f0ztw5_4u" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>On August 1, Yitong’s plugin will be available to the Figma community. <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugins-launch-event/">Tune in to watch our announcement live</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Behind the Plugins: Tiffany Chen, UX Designer @ Microsoft</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/behind-the-plugins-tiffany-chen-microsoft/</link>
      <description>Meet Tiffany Chen, UX Designer at Microsoft and Figma plugins beta customer. Learn what she has been building for the Figma community and why.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Editor&#39;s Note: This article is part 2 of a 5-part series about the creators behind Figma plugins—coming to a Figma near you on August 1, 2019. </em></p><p>Today, I’m sitting down with Tiffany Chen, a UX designer on Microsoft’s modern input and accessibility team. Tiffany joined Microsoft after graduating from Brown University in 2018 to be at the intersection of accessibility, inclusivity, education, design, and technology. This is the first time she’s built a design plugin! </p><p>With Microsoft’s focus on accessibility both internally and externally, Tiffany hopes to help create more awareness around making product experiences more inclusive. She believes to do so, “we need to also lower the barrier to entry for people who want to become designers.”</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="ir8FnYeKnX2L" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><strong>Q: What Figma plugin are you building?A:</strong> Accessibility-focused order annotator plugin; it automates a lot of the (very manual) design process for annotating for accessibility purposes.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Q: Why are you building for the Figma community?A:</strong> Multiple reasons:</p><ol><li>The new plugin system and Figma APIs have been a breeze to use. In building for the Figma community, I spend much more time on making things rather than debugging or trying to get stuff set up.</li><li>Design tools just don’t have every single feature a designer would want. Figma plugins make it easy to advocate for myself and others by giving me the ability to create the design tools we need, rather than crossing our fingers and hoping someone else will make them for us.</li><li>The Figma community is super supportive and fun!</li></ol><p><strong>Q: What do you hope to achieve by contributing to the design community?A:</strong> I love helping other people start their own non-traditional design journey! It’s always very exciting to me when someone reaches out asking how they can become a designer when they’re currently in a psychology,  anthropology,  international relations, or computer science role. I think the design community will always need more of that diversity in perspectives, knowledge, and experience. For example, since my background is in computer science, my evaluation and implementation of designs tend to sit on the cusp of feasibility and novelty. </p><p><strong>Q: What design project are you most proud of?A:</strong> I embarked on a project where I asked people odd questions like, “What lies were you told as a child?” The idea was to prompt them to tell me stories about their lives. After getting the responses, I illustrated their stories and turned them into an <a href="https://tiffanyc.me/storiesbook/">art-dev website</a> using layering and parallax. This project is what really started getting me excited about combining my technical and creative sides.</p><p><strong>Q: What company or designer do you look up to or aspire to?A:</strong> The principles behind B Corporation are super interesting to me. Basically, every decision that a B Corp certified company makes has to factor in the impact that the decision will have on its workers, customers, suppliers, and the environment. Some famous B Corps include Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s, Kickstarter, and Patagonia.</p><p><strong>Q: What do you think the design industry needs more of?A:</strong> I&#39;d love to see increased accessibility in the design space—not just greater awareness of what it means to make products and experiences that are inclusive to all, but also decreased barriers to entry for people who want to become designers. I think we’re making great progress on the latter front now that so many resources are posted online. Tools like Figma that are both simple AND powerful are the things that I think will exponentially accelerate this progress!</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="YK0BAbTXXIHB" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>On August 1, Tiffany’s plugin will be available to the Figma community.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Meet Sam Mason de Caires, UX Engineer at Cloudflare and Figma plugins beta customer and learn about what he has been creating with the plugins API.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Editor&#39;s Note: This article is part 1 of a 5-part series about the creators behind Figma plugins.</em></p><p>Plugins are coming to Figma. This would not have happened without the Figma community. </p><p>A little over a month ago, we onboarded our first customers to the plugins beta. We were humbled by the incredible response from the community and completely amazed by what we saw when our customers got their hands on our new plugin APIs.</p><p>From data visualizations, to content imports, to accessibility tools, we can’t wait to share what our beta customers have built. But first, let’s go behind the plugins and meet some of our very first creators. </p><p>In this series, we discuss what inspires them, how they see the design community evolving,and of course, get a sneak peek into the plugins they’ve been working on. </p><p>Let’s meet our first creator.</p><p>Already having built four plugins for Figma’s community, Sam Mason de Caires, a UX Engineer at Cloudflare says he is most excited about Figma’s plugin API because, “it enables designers to automate tedious tasks so they can then work on the meaningful parts of their process, like designing.” </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="yr2R0NfpVAGC" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><strong>Q: Why did you become a designer/developer?A:</strong> I’ve always enjoyed the idea of being able to build something out of nothing and seeing people around the world use your creation. That&#39;s what led me down the path of becoming a developer. At the same time, I’ve always enjoyed design and recognized that there is a lot of crossover between design and development. In my current role at Cloudflare, my skills as a developer have allowed me to meaningfully contribute to design projects.</p><p><strong>Q: What Figma plugins are you building?A:</strong> I have built a few translation plugins, a data replacement plugin, a theme UI generator, and a graph plugin and a color reference plugin for colorblindness. Here’s a sneak peek at one of the color reference plugin:</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Q: Why are you building for the Figma community?A:</strong> I find the idea of a design tool with an API to be an interesting one. Things that are often tedious and done by hand can easily be automated if we have access to the underlying code of the tool, therefore giving designers more time to work on the meaningful parts of their process, like designing. </p><p><strong>Q: How do you see the design community evolving over the next 5 years?A:</strong> I think there will be big enhancements in generative design. So rather than individually designing each possible state, you will instead be able to pass in data that describes what you want and the tools will be able to generate all the possible variations. Then you, as a designer, would decide the best facets of each one to make the fully formed final output. I would urge anyone who wants to learn more to read <a href="https://mrmrs.cc/writing/chaos-design/">Adam Morse’s post on Chaos Design</a>. He has done some incredibly deep thinking on the topics of design tooling and what the evolution of design might look like.</p><p><strong>Q: How do you see yourself contributing to the community long term?A:</strong> For a long time I didn&#39;t think my skills as a developer would have been able to help the community much, but I&#39;m now realizing that I can help make tools that help designers work faster and with more confidence. I would like to continue contributing more of those tools and processes to the community.</p><p><strong>Q: What designer and/or company do you look up to?A:</strong> I’m a huge fan of Stripe and the designers and engineers there. Not just for their beautiful aesthetics and great UI, but the fact that they made a payment processing service a really cool and desirable product. They also seem to want to help people outside of their immediate product by creating businesses like Stripe Press.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="RHJX9tshlqnI" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>On August 1, Sam’s plugins will be available to the Figma community. <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugins-launch-event/">Tune in to watch our announcement live</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>A step-by-step guide to using Figma for retrospectives</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/a-step-by-step-guide-to-using-figma-for-retrospectives/</link>
      <description>Retrospectives can be an easy, lightweight way to introduce your team to a new tool.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If your team has adopted either the <a href="https://www.guru99.com/agile-vs-scrum.html">agile or scrum methodologies</a> for software development, you probably do a lot of retrospectives. They allow for the team to come together at the end of a project or sprint and evaluate how things went by writing on a whiteboard (or post-its).</p><p>There are a few drawbacks to this approach. It can be a bit intimidating to stand up and write in front of an audience. Furthermore, not everyone in the room can read each other&#39;s hand-writing, and usually only a few people at a time can fit in front of the board.</p><p>That&#39;s why I recommend using Figma for retrospectives instead. Because Figma is multiplayer, everyone can jump in the file at the same time and see each other&#39;s text easily. Figma&#39;s collaborative features (like commenting) ensure every person in the room can contribute. Lastly, if you&#39;re hoping to convince your team to switch to Figma, retrospectives are a lightweight way to introduce them to the tool and pique their curiosity.</p><p>To get you started, I put together this step-by-step guide (<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/14PT2TH5chrTQu5KnFpXH6/Team-Retrospective-Template/duplicate">with an accompanying template</a>) on how to use Figma for retrospectives.</p><h2 id="file-sharing-and-permissions-for-retrospectives"><a href="#file-sharing-and-permissions-for-retrospectives">File sharing and permissions for retrospectives</a></h2><p>Step one in a retrospective: Create a Figma file for everyone to jump into together (or <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/14PT2TH5chrTQu5KnFpXH6/Team-Retrospective-Template/duplicate">duplicate the template</a> I created). Sharing a file is easy — once inside it, simply navigate to the top menu bar and locate the large blue “Share” button on the right. You can then choose to invite each person by email address, or simply create and share a public link. Just make sure the file is editable for anyone with that link first!</p><figure></figure><h2 id="frames-for-retrospective-categories"><a href="#frames-for-retrospective-categories">Frames for retrospective categories</a></h2><p>Just as you might divide a whiteboard into sections for a retrospective, you can divide the Figma canvas by using <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/36-frame-tool">frames</a>. In the <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/14PT2TH5chrTQu5KnFpXH6/Team-Retrospective-Template/duplicate">linked template</a>, there are three frames, one for each retrospective category:</p><ol><li>What should we continue doing</li><li>What should we stop doing</li><li>What should we start doing</li></ol><p>In each of the frames, I&#39;ve added <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/54-constraints">constraints</a> to the various child elements, such as the header and the backgrounds. Constraints in Figma allow you to specify how elements inside behave when the frame is stretched or shrunk. So now if you resize the retrospective frames (to give people more room to type, for example), everything inside them will automatically adjust.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="sticky-note-components-for-retrospective-feedback"><a href="#sticky-note-components-for-retrospective-feedback">Sticky note components for retrospective feedback</a></h2><p>When people jump into your Figma file, you&#39;ll notice colorful multiplayer cursors appear. For those who are new to our collaborative tool, it can be fun and exciting to watch them moving around. </p><p>I’ve included a few “sticky note” <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/66-components">components</a> that make it easy for people to quickly add their comment or suggestion to a category frame. To duplicate the sticky note master component, either select it and press Command + D, or hold Option/Alt while dragging.</p><p>Figma components allow for <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/306-using-instances#override">overrides</a>, so people can change elements inside the sticky note instances (such as text, color, and effects) without breaking the component. Thus, each editor can adjust their notes to make them feel like their own.</p><p>If you have remote folks on your team, using Figma for the retrospective can help people feel more included and involved. You don&#39;t have to point a computer camera at the whiteboard and hope for the best — everyone can see what is happening on screen. (They can even <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-feature-highlight-observation-mode/">click others&#39; avatars</a> to follow along.)</p><figure></figure><h2 id="making-it-work-for-you"><a href="#making-it-work-for-you">Making it work for you</a></h2><p>This retrospective template is meant to be a starting point for you and your team. If you want to make the file feel like more of your own, here are a few ideas:</p><h3 id="_1-add-your-company-s-logo-and-brand-color"><a href="#_1-add-your-company-s-logo-and-brand-color">1. Add your company’s logo and brand color</a></h3><p>In <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/14PT2TH5chrTQu5KnFpXH6/Team-Retrospective-Template/duplicate">the template</a>, I’ve included a component you can use as a way to include your company’s logo in the retrospective. This can be a nice touch if you choose to export the frames after the meeting. In the <a href="https://help.figma.com/category/221-styles">Styles</a> panel on the right, you’ll also see a style, ready to be customized with your company’s brand color(s).</p><figure></figure><h3 id="_2-create-new-components"><a href="#_2-create-new-components">2. Create new components</a></h3><p>Teams will often “+1” an item to communicate agreement or indicate that they’d like to discuss it further. If members of your team do this, I recommend creating a new component for it! Just as with the sticky note component, they can create copies, and adjust the size and color of their own instances.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7b91b30ed956c5af7ca16c77cdbbec65a32b3f01-927x536.png?rect=0,0,927,535&amp;w=670&amp;h=387&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7b91b30ed956c5af7ca16c77cdbbec65a32b3f01-927x536.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7b91b30ed956c5af7ca16c77cdbbec65a32b3f01-927x536.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7b91b30ed956c5af7ca16c77cdbbec65a32b3f01-927x536.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7b91b30ed956c5af7ca16c77cdbbec65a32b3f01-927x536.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 927w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="_3-create-different-cover-pages"><a href="#_3-create-different-cover-pages">3.

      <title>Product design portfolio tips from a Figma recruiter</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/product-design-portfolio-tips-from-a-figma-recruiter/</link>
      <description>To avoid common portfolio pitfalls, put yourself in the shoes of your target audience.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As someone that reviews portfolios constantly, I have respect for the challenge. It can be difficult to step outside your own perspective and craft your story in a way that’s compelling to others. You have to return to old projects and describe their narrative and meaning in fresh, compelling ways. You must also put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into the arrangement of your work so it’s presented clearly. Crafting a portfolio is no small feat, but if you do it right, you’ll reap major dividends in the job search process.</p><p>I see a lot of portfolios in my work as a design recruiter here at Figma. Applicants often make the same mistakes again and again — from including far too much text in project highlights, to overcomplicating animations on their landing page.</p><p>I recommend you build your portfolio the same way you would tackle any design challenge: Start by putting yourself in the shoes of your target audience. </p><h2 id="know-your-audience-and-your-goal"><a href="#know-your-audience-and-your-goal">Know your audience and your goal</a></h2><p>Typically in the product design industry, the person who reviews your portfolio and decides whether to interview you will be:</p><ul><li>A design manager</li><li>A creative director</li><li>A head of design</li><li>A VP of design</li></ul><p>Leaders like this are very busy. They’re often running between meetings, phone calls, and interviews, so unfortunately sometimes they have limited time to review portfolios (we’re talking minutes, or even seconds). They’re trying to quickly parse a lot of information in that short period of time:</p><ul><li>What type of design you do</li><li>Where your talents and passions lie</li><li>Whether you have the right experience for this particular role</li><li>How you tackle design challenges</li><li>Your overall design abilities</li></ul><p>Assume they’re dealing with limited time, and won’t always be able to dig through pages of content.  Instead, you need to highlight the most pertinent information for the particular role you’re applying for. In this post, I’ll teach you how to do that as effectively as possible, both with your portfolio’s landing page and with your individual projects.</p><h2 id="landing-page"><a href="#landing-page">Landing page</a></h2><h3 id="make-previews-of-projects-easy-to-parse"><a href="#make-previews-of-projects-easy-to-parse">Make previews of projects easy to parse</a></h3><p>The key to the perfect landing page is to structure each project thumbnail in a cohesive way.</p><p>For example, if you’ve done recent projects for a range of top-tier companies and want to show off their logos, make sure each logo thumbnail is the same size. If instead you want your landing page to represent the actual work you did for different projects, then make sure the screenshots are styled similarly (like with the same color background and dropshadow). Whatever your approach, I recommend labeling each project with key details (like the company name, your role in the project, and the medium you worked in) in a consistent, parsable format.</p><p>There’s nothing that makes me happier than opening a portfolio and seeing 8 equally sized, thoughtfully crafted rectangles. After all, recruiters have to skim hundreds of portfolios for hours at a time. We’re a lot more likely go through every project in a portfolio if the landing page has an aesthetically pleasing system to it. It takes less mental energy to comprehend it!</p><p>Of course, all good rules are meant to be broken. If you have a really creative way of laying out project that indicates which one matters most, go for it! Just make sure the thumbnail differences are the result of thoughtful layout decisions, not haphazard design.</p><h3 id="get-to-the-good-stuff"><a href="#get-to-the-good-stuff">Get to the good stuff</a></h3><p>How many <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6rHeD5x2tI">clicks</a> does it take to get to your work? Landing page with “about you” content? Click. Work icon in upper right-hand corner? Click. Projects laid out so you have to pick one? Click. </p><p>Your target audience can’t go hunting for information. Your landing page should give them an overview of your design projects, so they’re only one click away from your work.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0cba01681dfa0628fc3a44389ec3ae82db21807c-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0cba01681dfa0628fc3a44389ec3ae82db21807c-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0cba01681dfa0628fc3a44389ec3ae82db21807c-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0cba01681dfa0628fc3a44389ec3ae82db21807c-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0cba01681dfa0628fc3a44389ec3ae82db21807c-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Like the above example, you should structure each project thumbnail in a cohesive way with relevant information.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="projects"><a href="#projects">Projects</a></h2><h3 id="what-to-pick"><a href="#what-to-pick">What to pick</a></h3><p>Of course, you can’t build the perfect landing page if you haven’t picked your projects yet! I suggest tailoring your project choices based on your career goals. </p><p>Are you interested in mobile, web, or virtual reality design jobs? Make that clear by highlighting your experience in that area. Are you dying to quit the e-commerce industry and want to move into fintech, healthcare, or something else? Choose previous work accordingly. </p><p>“Tailor your projects” may seem like obvious advice, but applicants often struggle with this. They try to capture the entire breadth of their design career in one portfolio. They assume people will take the time to go through everything  — but hiring managers often can’t.</p><p>Here’s a few other challenges you may face in picking projects, with a few tips for overcoming them:</p><p><strong>1. You worked at top tier brands...a long time ago.</strong>Don’t stock your portfolio with projects from the mid nineties — even if that <em>is</em> the time in your career you worked at Apple. Instead, rely on your resume to show the breadth of brands you worked at, and let your portfolio shine a light on your contemporary work. Of course, if you designed the famous iPod silhouette campaign in the early 2000s, please do highlight that. But don’t feel the need to stick in work that doesn’t represent you as a designer anymore just to show off the brand names.</p><p><strong>2.  You don’t have the experience for the sector you want to focus on.</strong>If all of your work is in mobile but you dream of designing for the web, you may struggle with tailoring your portfolio. I recommend doing a few side projects to develop web-first content, instead of submitting your mobile-only portfolio and hoping for the best. </p><p>Of course, it’s not just mobile → web where this challenge can spring up. Print designers often want to go into UX/UI design. Visual designers dream of UX research roles. Engineers hope to double-down on front-end ideation. Design is an ever-changing field!</p><p><strong>3. Your best work is not in the right medium or industry.</strong>Let’s say you have design projects in a range of fields, but your best stuff isn’t in the right vertical for the job you’re applying for. You kicked some serious ass on a recent mobile project, but you want a web-based design job.</p><p>Consider creating a mockup of how that same design would’ve looked and functioned on the web, then include both the original and the mockup in your portfolio. As long as you have enough other web-based projects to indicate your experience, we’ll consider you as a candidate.</p><p><strong>4. You actually want a generalist role</strong>If you’re interested in becoming an early designer at an early stage startup or joining a smaller company where you have to wear a lot of hats, ignore my previous advice! In the case of generalist roles, you should demonstrate the breadth of experience you have with clearly labeled projects. Make it obvious what medium you did the work in, what your personal role in the project was, etc.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34b16c9c724b04f5d66c2c39a493abab6036bac1-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34b16c9c724b04f5d66c2c39a493abab6036bac1-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34b16c9c724b04f5d66c2c39a493abab6036bac1-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34b16c9c724b04f5d66c2c39a493abab6036bac1-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/34b16c9c724b04f5d66c2c39a493abab6036bac1-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="what-to-highlight-in-each-project"><a href="#what-to-highlight-in-each-project">What to highlight in each project</a></h3><p>Much like with your landing page, you should be judicious and thoughtful in selecting what aspects of your projects to highlight. If you write up nitty gritty details on every stage — ideation, whiteboarding, paper prototyping, wireframes, information architecture, UI design, visual design — you’ll make reviewers’ eyes glaze over. They don’t want a blow-by-blow of what you ate for breakfast the second day of user testing. </p><p>Instead, think about what kind of role you want as a designer and focus on that. Visual design isn’t your cup of tea? Don’t include it in your portfolio. It’s as simple as that. </p><p>That’s not to say you shouldn’t tell a complete narrative about the project. I want to know:</p><ul><li>What problem you were trying to solve</li><li>How you came up with the solution</li><li>What design iterations you went through on the way</li><li>Which role you played in the project</li><li>BONUS CREDIT: What you learned and would do differently next time.</li><li>If you can work it in, it doesn’t hurt to give your team a little shoutout. (See <a href="https://www.mattrancatore.com/#/sportradar/">example here</a>.)</li></ul><p>In crafting your story, remember you won’t be sitting next to reviewers, whispering in their ear. Your profile needs to be able to live and breathe without you. Sort through the chaos, share only the most important milestones, and tell a simple, compelling story. </p><p>You’re applying for a designer role, not a content writing job, so where you can, create imagery that conveys information for you (instead of relying solely on text). If you’re dying to provide more details beyond a couple paragraphs of text, then link from your portfolio to a PDF with extensive project information. That way the reviewer can choose whether they want to dive deeper.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f88202a23557583b71bc43bb67f8ebd45938029-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f88202a23557583b71bc43bb67f8ebd45938029-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f88202a23557583b71bc43bb67f8ebd45938029-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f88202a23557583b71bc43bb67f8ebd45938029-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f88202a23557583b71bc43bb67f8ebd45938029-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Don’t include too much text in your project overviews.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="final-tips-and-tricks"><a href="#final-tips-and-tricks">Final tips and tricks</a></h2><h3 id="spelling-counts"><a href="#spelling-counts">Spelling counts</a></h3><p>Speaking of content, let me just scream from the rooftops: PROOFREADING MATTERS! It’s so important. If there are spelling errors in your portfolio, hiring managers notice. Design VPs often got to where they are because they have an eye for tiny incongruencies.  </p><p>I’ll never forget showing a strong portfolio to a hiring manager — of a candidate I was really excited about — and the very first thing this manager spotted was a spelling error. It’s hard to come back from that.</p><p>It may seem unfair that you’re being evaluated on both your visual communication and your spelling skills, but there’s a reason. They both fit into the category of being detail oriented.</p><p>If you can’t be detail oriented with your own work, why should a hiring manager assume you’ll have that focus on the projects they give you? I’ve seen many portfolios with basic spelling errors, so please please PLEASE proofread.  Or have your friend do it, or your mom OR both! It can’t hurt.</p><h3 id="focus-on-usability-over-bells-and-whistles"><a href="#focus-on-usability-over-bells-and-whistles">Focus on usability over bells and whistles</a></h3><p>Pay attention to the interactions you implement, and resist the urge to include bells and whistles at the expense of basic usability. Some people like to get fancy with things that scroll horizontally/automatically (or via carousels).  That’s not always the best for user experience, so you should ask a few people to test what you’ve built. Is it easy for them to navigate your portfolio quickly, or do they have to take some time figuring out how it works?</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/52e5f0e3856fce5f26915bf0ca5278ea832c513b-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;h=469&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/52e5f0e3856fce5f26915bf0ca5278ea832c513b-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/52e5f0e3856fce5f26915bf0ca5278ea832c513b-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/52e5f0e3856fce5f26915bf0ca5278ea832c513b-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/52e5f0e3856fce5f26915bf0ca5278ea832c513b-1000x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="wrapping-it-up"><a href="#wrapping-it-up">Wrapping it up</a></h2><p>Phew! You still with me? We covered a LOT here. I’ve shared everything I know about portfolios after my 7 years working as a design recruiter. Hopefully you’ve found these tips helpful.</p><p>The most important thing for you to remember: Always keep your target audience in mind. They’re busy and don’t have the time to spend digging for important information. Use your design skills to tell a strong story about where you’ve been and where you want to go! Keep written text simple, concise and to the point...and spell check the shit out of it ;).</p><p>If you’re on the hunt for a job now, we’re hiring Product Designers and a Brand Designer at Figma.

      <title>Bring Figma prototypes to life with GIFs</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/bring-figma-prototypes-to-life-with-gifs/</link>
      <description>Whether you’re prototyping a mobile app or designing a product user flow, simply add a GIF to your Figma file and watch it come to life when you click “Present.”</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re thrilled to announce that as of today Figma supports animated GIFs in prototypes! Simply add a GIF to your file and watch it come to life when you click “Present.”</p><p>Whether you’re prototyping a mobile app, designing a product user flow, or putting together a presentation, GIFs are a simple way to make your designs more dynamic—and perhaps bring smiles to a few faces. GIFs can stand in for motion designs, video elements, and subtle animations that can otherwise be hard to represent faithfully in prototypes.</p><p>Here’s how GIFs in Figma prototypes work: </p><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>Add a GIF to your Figma file.</strong> Some of our favorite tools for GIF creation are ScreenFlow, LICEcap, Principle, and After Effects.</li><li><strong>Click “Present”</strong> and watch your prototype come to life.</li></ul><p>Because GIFs only animate in prototypes, they will appear as a static image in your file. To help you differentiate between multiple similar GIFs, you can select the cover frame that’s displayed in the editor by opening the GIF modal from the properties panel and scrubbing to a different frame. This is incredibly helpful if your GIF has a blank first frame, or if you have multiple GIFs with the same starting frame. </p><p>Lastly, if you’re creating a mobile prototype, you will also notice improved OS-aware momentum scrolling and new touch cursors—a few details we introduced to make your design feel like the real thing. </p><figure></figure><p>For some inspiration as you try out these new features, here are some of our favorite animated moments around the Web. We can’t wait to see all the things you’ll do with GIFs in Figma prototypes! Make sure to tweet what you’re working on by tagging <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign">@FigmaDesign</a> with #GIFma.</p><h2 id="a-few-of-our-favorite-animated-moments"><a href="#a-few-of-our-favorite-animated-moments">A few of our favorite animated moments</a></h2><h3 id="_1-uber-s-animated-splash-screen"><a href="#_1-uber-s-animated-splash-screen">1.

      <title>What’s new on DesignSystems.com: June roundup</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/whats-new-on-design-systems-june-roundup/</link>
      <description>Check out what&#39;s new on designsystems.com: Open-sourced React containers, while-labeled design systems, a complete guide to iconography, and more</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We set out to make <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/">DesignSystems.com</a> the go-to destination on the web for design systems creators, designers, developers and managers to learn about the process of designing, building and maintaining design systems. The community responded in a huge way and the enthusiasm and contributions have led to some really incredible articles being published in the last month. Many of you have reached out with ideas you want to contribute to the site and we are so excited to work with the community to get more of these ideas and learnings out there. </p><p>Here is a look at what we added in June. </p><h2 id="the-complete-guide-to-iconography"><a href="#the-complete-guide-to-iconography">The complete guide to iconography</a></h2><p>We were lucky enough that Bonnie Kate Wolf was one of the people who reached out wanting to contribute. Bonnie is an illustrator and iconography designer, currently at OpenTable and previously at Square. She wrote a <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/iconography-guide/">detailed guide</a> covering everything you need to know to create, organize and implement iconography in your design system. This guide goes deep, covering everything from strokes and fills to how to use Boolean operations when creating your icons to how to prep your icons for developer handoff. In Bonnie’s words, “there aren&#39;t many people who love to design icons and even fewer who are great at it. I wrote this guide to help you become one of those people.” Whether you are just getting started or are a seasoned pro, we think you will learn something new in <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/iconography-guide/">this guide</a>. </p><h2 id="why-we-create-design-systems-an-agency-s"><a href="#why-we-create-design-systems-an-agency-s">Why we create design systems: An agency’s perspective</a></h2><p>Instrument is a digital brand and experience innovation company. They work with companies like Nike, Google, Airbnb, Sonos, and LinkedIn on product design, new tech innovation, branding, marketing, strategy — the works. They care deeply about delivering a complete design system, rather than a one-off solve, and also value creating reusable functional components that can be used across myriad applications and at scale. But of course, getting to a shared place of understanding with the client on what that means and what that looks like takes a high degree of collaboration. Instrument takes us through their process and gives us a look behind the scenes at how they approach developing design systems with their clients. You can read all about it <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/why-we-build-design-systems-an-agencys-perspective/">here</a>. </p><h2 id="react-containers-some-assembly-required"><a href="#react-containers-some-assembly-required">React containers, some assembly required</a></h2><p>Zendesk’s open-sourced design system, <a href="https://garden.zendesk.com">Garden</a>, has always prioritized accessibility. Garden uses a pattern they named “containers” to share common keyboard and accessibility logic between react components. The container pattern renders no UI, handles keyboard and mouse interaction, and supports RTL layouts. Improving on this pattern, the Zendesk Design Systems team recently released <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/react-containers-some-assembly-required/">react-containers</a> — a new open source library. Rather than require the user to bring down a package – styling included – just to use the no-UI containers, these patterns are now in their own repo. They’ve also re-written them to be smaller, smarter and adhere more closely to the WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1. Learn more about how you can leverage this new pattern <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/react-containers-some-assembly-required/">here</a>. </p><h2 id="white-labeling-putting-the-design-system-in-users"><a href="#white-labeling-putting-the-design-system-in-users">White-labeling: Putting the design system in users&#39; hands</a></h2><p>When the Dawn Labs team were given the challenge to create a system that could be both customizable by third party users, but also constrained enough to keep the app feeling consistent. So they turned to <code>styled-components</code>, <code>styled-system</code>, and a GraphQL backend to make it happen. On top of that, they also needed a styling escape hatch so that end-users could customize whatever they wanted without their client’s intervention. They solved this in a clever way, using global CSS injection with CSS variables. In his <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/white-labeling-putting-the-design-system-in-users-hands/">post</a>, Mike Fix from Dawn Labs walks us through their approach step-by-step. </p><p>Thank you to the talented contributors who shared their insight and knowledge this month. <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/">Sign up for updates</a> to stay on top of the latest in Design Systems.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Work smarter with components, plugins, and other new releases</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The last three months have been busy here at Figma. We’ve made a ton of rapid improvements to Components, Smart Selection, and other features you use every day to work smarter. We dedicated ourselves to a quality week where we smashed a lot of bugs. And we launched the beta for Figma plugins, which is something that we have been working on behind the scenes for quite a long time!</p><p>In case you missed some of our announcements, here’s a round-up of what we released this past Spring:  </p><h2 id="component-updates-to-help-scale-your-design"><a href="#component-updates-to-help-scale-your-design">Component updates to help scale your design systems</a></h2><p>Components are core to how you and your fellow teammates create reusable designs faster. A huge focus for our team this last quarter was to make creating and managing Components easier. One of the goals was to address common feature requests. The other was simply to save you time. Here’s what’s new to Components in Figma: </p><ul><li><strong>Create multiple Components in one click.</strong> Select as many objects as you want and turn them all into Components instantly.</li></ul><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>Right-click an instance and see related Components directly in the Context Menu.</strong> Easily swap with another instance.</li></ul><figure></figure><ul><li>With the new <strong>Return to Instance</strong> button, navigate to your Master Component to reference or edit, and click to get back to the instance you were working on.</li></ul><figure></figure><ul><li>[For your local components only] Make changes to an instance and push those overrides to the master Component—great for iterating on and updating local components efficiently.</li></ul><figure></figure><p>For more info on how to use components, check out our <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/component-styles-and-shared-library-best-practices/">Best Practice Guide on Components, Styles, and Team Libraries</a>.</p><h2 id="introducing-the-figma-plugins-beta"><a href="#introducing-the-figma-plugins-beta">Introducing the Figma Plugins beta</a></h2><p>Earlier this month, we announced the public beta of our plugin API. This is a project that the team has been working on for quite a long time. It has been amazing and humbling to see the incredible response from our community. What&#39;s even more incredible is what some of our customers are already starting to create in the beta. Here’s a sneak peek of what some of our first plugin creators are building:</p><h2 id="improve-handoff-workflows-with-developers"><a href="#improve-handoff-workflows-with-developers">Improve handoff workflows with developers</a></h2><p>Collaboration is core to Figma’s product DNA. One of the key collaboration moments in the design process is working with your developers. This quarter, we focused on making sure your developers have all the context they need about your designs during the handoff process. </p><ul><li>See <strong>Component descriptions</strong> in the Code panel. Write useful notes to your developers, like instructions, exceptions, or GitHub URLs, for a more seamless hand-off.</li></ul><figure></figure><ul><li>View <strong>new additions in the Code Panel</strong>, like text styles names and font feature settings. Help your developers understand what style and font settings to use when implementing your design.</li><li>Interested in more tips on improving collaboration with developers? Check out our <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/tips-for-a-better-developer-workflow-in-figma/">Tips for a Better Developer Workflow in Figma</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="a-forever-improving-editor-that-keeps-up-with-you"><a href="#a-forever-improving-editor-that-keeps-up-with-you">A forever-improving Editor that keeps up with you</a></h2><p>We are always looking for ways to make the Editor faster and more useful to you. This quarter, we participated in a big quality week where we resolved 17 bugs. We also shipped a bunch of improvements to Smart Selection and our drawing tools. </p><ul><li>Easily delete and duplicate text, images, and objects using the updated <strong>Smart Selection</strong> feature. The surrounding objects automatically move to fill the void or make room for the new addition.</li></ul><figure></figure><ul><li>We made a subtle, but important update to how <strong>Line Height</strong> is distributed and measured in an effort to bring Line Height to be more in line with Web standards.</li></ul><p>And of course, we introduced new and improved shortcuts:</p><ul><li><code>Alt</code> + <code>2</code> on a PC will now always allow you to search your Assets tab, even when        the Assets tab is open</li><li>Holding <code>Shift</code> in vector edit mode will now snap vector points to 45°</li><li>Holding <code>Shift</code> while drawing an object will now automatically enable constrain             proportions</li></ul><h2 id="more-control-and-visibility-into-user-activity"><a href="#more-control-and-visibility-into-user-activity">More control and visibility into user activity</a></h2><p>For admins on Figma’s Organization plan, you now have more visibility into who’s using Figma and who isn’t, so you can make more informed user management decisions. </p><p>On the Members dashboard, you can review three new activity stats — date upgraded, last edit, last seen — that provide a snapshot of each user’s activity. Additionally, you can export a CSV with more attributes for further analysis. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1fecb9fa22728546e2ecf7f76a41e471205b498-1600x947.png?rect=1,0,1598,947&amp;w=670&amp;h=397&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1fecb9fa22728546e2ecf7f76a41e471205b498-1600x947.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1fecb9fa22728546e2ecf7f76a41e471205b498-1600x947.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1fecb9fa22728546e2ecf7f76a41e471205b498-1600x947.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1fecb9fa22728546e2ecf7f76a41e471205b498-1600x947.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e1fecb9fa22728546e2ecf7f76a41e471205b498-1600x947.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>To get the latest updates and announcements, follow <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign">@FigmaDesign</a> on Twitter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What to expect when moving from Sketch to Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/what-to-expect-when-moving-from-sketch-to-figma/</link>
      <description>This post will help you understand the similarities and differences between Sketch and Figma.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09f097c5706cf124fa1676d538a114ffa9861c8a-2400x1256.png?rect=1,0,2398,1256&amp;w=693&amp;h=363&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09f097c5706cf124fa1676d538a114ffa9861c8a-2400x1256.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 347w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09f097c5706cf124fa1676d538a114ffa9861c8a-2400x1256.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 520w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09f097c5706cf124fa1676d538a114ffa9861c8a-2400x1256.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 693w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09f097c5706cf124fa1676d538a114ffa9861c8a-2400x1256.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1040w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09f097c5706cf124fa1676d538a114ffa9861c8a-2400x1256.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1386w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Moving sucks! Whether you&#39;re moving across the country or down the street, it&#39;s never fun. The biggest pain isn&#39;t necessarily the packing, cleaning, or unpacking —instead, it&#39;s the new routines you&#39;re forced to adopt. You&#39;re probably still going to store your silverware in a drawer in the kitchen, but now that drawer sits to the left of the sink instead of the right. It takes time to retrain your muscle memory that tells you to reach to the right.</p><p>In a similar fashion, moving from a tool like Sketch to Figma can be a bit of a struggle at first. The UI is slightly different, the keyboard shortcuts aren&#39;t all the same, and there are some core differences that take a little while to get used to. I remember when I switched to Figma, I had to work on a real project for a solid week or so to finally feel comfortable with it.</p><p>So, if you&#39;ve recently made the move to Figma (or are considering doing so), I hope this article helps you understand the differences and similarities. We want Figma to feel like home as quickly as possible for you.</p><p>The nice thing about moving from Sketch to Figma is that you get to keep all of your old designs. We have <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/81-import#sketch">an import feature</a> that allows you to bring in individual Sketch files into your Figma account. It keeps your layers intact and even brings over your symbols as components. (More on this in the <a href="https://www.figma.com/best-practices/what-to-expect-when-moving-from-sketch-to-figma/tips-and-tricks-for-the-move/">tips section</a> below.)</p><p>Here&#39;s how to do it:<br/>Click the import button found in the file browser or simply drag and drop a Sketch file in Figma.</p><figure></figure><p><em>Note: Depending on the size of the Sketch file it may take a few moments to import.</em></p><p>Once it&#39;s done importing, you can click on it to open, and voila! All of your pages, layers, text, shapes, etc. should now appear in Figma, exactly as they were in Sketch. With that being said there are a few things that we unfortunately can&#39;t bring over, like Sketch styles, due to how different our implementations are. For more information on what will or won&#39;t import from Sketch, check out our help center <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/81-import#sketch">article</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Plugins are coming to Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/plugins-are-coming-to-figma/</link>
      <description>We&#39;re introducing the beta for Figma plugins, and we’re calling all builders to apply to be among the first creators.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we&#39;re introducing the beta for Figma plugins, and we’re calling all builders to <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugins-beta">apply to be among the first creators</a>. </p><p>This is the next step in our journey of opening up the Figma platform. A year ago, we <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-platform/">launched the HTTP-based Figma API</a>, which customers can use to export Figma data to other tools. Since then, it’s been amazing to see the workflows people have developed. The Volvo Car Mobility team built custom Slack commands to export Figma icons into documents. <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/https-blog-figma-com-microsoft-automates-design-handoff-with-figmas-api/">Microsoft</a> automatically pushes design file updates to their development environment. <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/github-case-study/">GitHub</a> is now updating and distributing their SVG icon library, Octicons, more effectively. </p><p>We also saw a powerhouse team of designers and developers—Jackie Chui, Ahmad Al Haddad, and Mirko Santangelo—create a space for Figma users to share functionality built with our APIs. </p><p>We’ve been inspired by what our customers have created on top of our platform thus far. And we know many of you have dreams to do much more, like developing (and using!) plugins to further hone your design process. </p><p>That said, we’ve seen the challenges plugins can introduce to a design platform. We wanted to be thoughtful in how we open up our plugin APIs so builders have confidence in our platform’s stability and security.</p><p>For example, developers should never have to worry about their Figma plugins breaking, even when we ship new features and updates. That’s why we’ve explicitly designed our APIs for third parties to use, rather than just opening up our internal APIs. As many of you know, internal APIs tend to change, which results in extra work for 3rd party developers (they have to update their software for each platform release) and a bad experience for users (they have to worry about their favorite plugins breaking).</p><p>We wanted to make sure we did things right. When embarking on this project, we established a few principles to guide us:</p><ul><li>Plugins should be easy and intuitive to use for any designer.</li><li>If you can build a website, you should be able to make a plugin.</li><li>People should be able to author plugins with popular programming languages.</li><li>Plugins should not be detrimental to the performance and user experience of Figma.</li><li>Figma should fully support and maintain all APIs that plugins rely on.</li></ul><p>These principles will hopefully ensure plugins feel core to our product, for both developers and the end-users. </p><p>So if you know basic HTML and JavaScript, we invite you to <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugins-beta">apply to join our plugins beta</a>. </p><h2 id="what-can-you-do-in-the-beta"><a href="#what-can-you-do-in-the-beta">What can you do in the beta?</a></h2><p>You can build plugins that speed up your design workflow. For example, you could automate repetitive tasks or bring real data into your files. You’ll also be able to share the plugins you develop with folks on your team. </p><h2 id="who-should-sign-up-for-the-beta"><a href="#who-should-sign-up-for-the-beta">Who should sign up for the beta?</a></h2><p>If you have a plugin idea and the ability to build a website, consider applying to the beta! Since our platform is web-based, you’ll find it easy to build and maintain Figma plugins.</p><h2 id="can-anyone-join-the-beta"><a href="#can-anyone-join-the-beta">Can anyone join the beta?</a></h2><p>We can only allow a select number of users into the beta at this time, but we plan to open plugins to everyone soon. We’ll be prioritizing access based on what you want to build. Our goal is to enable a broad group of beta users to stress test and shape our APIs with a variety of plugin ideas. </p><h2 id="how-to-sign-up-for-the-beta"><a href="#how-to-sign-up-for-the-beta">How to sign up for the beta</a></h2><p>Apply for the beta <a href="https://www.figma.com/plugins-beta">here</a>. </p><p>Can’t wait to see what you all have in store for us. </p><p>P.S. If you can’t or don’t want to code, hang on tight. You’ll be able to access and use these community-powered plugins soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As a result, you&#39;ll need to establish patterns for consistent, legible typography early in the process of creating your design system. Doing so will make it easier for you to scale typography across multiple applications and devices, without complicating the handoff between designers and developers.</p><p>In this article we cover what you should think through when it comes to working with type in Figma. We&#39;ll offer workflow suggestions to make the process of using and implementing text styles more efficient for both designers and developers.</p><h2 id="text-style-basics"><a href="#text-style-basics">Text style basics</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/186-styles-creating-styles">text styles</a> functionality in Figma makes it easy to repeatably apply a collection of properties (like line height and size) to text objects in Figma. You can put these styles <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/29-team-library">into a library</a>, then easily share them within your team or across your organization.</p><p>Text styles remove much of the guesswork and variability from the design process. If one of the text parameters needs to change as part of an improvement or redesign, then you can push updates to these styles across all files where they have been used (<a href="https://help.figma.com/article/29-team-library#publish">simply by publishing an update to their original Figma library</a>).</p><p>Before we continue, I&#39;ll briefly outline which properties are part of Figma&#39;s text styles, and which aren&#39;t.</p><p><strong>Properties defined in a Figma text style</strong></p><ul><li>The font family, weight, size</li><li>Line height</li><li>Letter spacing, paragraph spacing, and indentation</li><li>Decoration (strikethrough and underline)</li><li>Transform (uppercase, lowercase, and capitalization)</li><li>Other Open Type features (tabular figures, small caps, etc.)</li></ul><p><strong>Properties not included in a Figma text style</strong></p><ul><li>Color</li><li>Justification (left, right, center, or justified)</li><li>Text box alignment (top, middle, or bottom)</li><li>Text box resizing (horizontal, vertical or fixed)</li></ul><p>If you&#39;re used to working in another design tool, you may find it strange that your text styles in Figma don&#39;t include traits like color or justification. Although it could take some getting used to, hopefully the benefits of this approach will quickly become clear. </p><p>When you maintain styles in a simpler format, it reduces the amount of time you have to spend creating them — you no longer have to account for all possible combinations of text, color, alignment, and so on. It also reduces the work required to maintain them, because you ultimately have less styles you have to update if something changes in your system. If you need right, left, and center aligned text, you can configure these properties separately from the style.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead of handing off designs to them at the end of the process, I was able to involve them from the beginning. From the moment I started wireframing, I&#39;d share the Figma URL — which stays up to date since Figma files are on the web — and they would give feedback and ask important clarifying questions. The resulting conversations shaped the designs in meaningful ways. It also helped us avoid any big surprises when designs were ready to be implemented in code. (I like to say Figma took me &#34;from handoff to handshake&#34; 😉.)</p><p>Because developer collaboration is such an important part of the design process, we&#39;re committed to evolving and improving the experience in Figma. In the past couple of weeks we made <a href="https://figmareleases.blogspot.com/">some small but important tweaks</a> to support collaboration with engineers. In this article I&#39;ll highlight a couple of these changes and share a few tips that many of our users have found helpful in their own workflows.</p><h2 id="help-developers-understand-more-about-your"><a href="#help-developers-understand-more-about-your">Help developers understand more about your components</a></h2><h3 id="view-only-users-can-now-go-to-main-components"><a href="#view-only-users-can-now-go-to-main-components">View-only users can now go to main components</a></h3><p>One of our latest updates makes it easier for developers to discover where <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/66-components">components</a> come from. Even if they have view-only access, they can now select a component instance and choose &#34;go to main component&#34; from the context menu (or alternatively in the <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/32-developer-handoff">code view</a> of the right-hand properties panel) just like editors of the file. Figma will then take them to the location of the parent component, whether it&#39;s located in the same file or a different one.</p><p>By seeing where the component is coming from, the developer has more context. They can deduce whether a component is part of the official design system or if it&#39;s a new element created by the designer for this specific project. That helps them figure out whether it already exists in their system, or if it needs to be built from scratch. In comparing the main component to the instance, the developer can also better understand the nature of the overrides that were applied to the instance.</p><p>If you think this new functionality will be useful, make sure developers on your team have view access to your libraries as well (otherwise they may get taken to a file where a main component resides, only to arrive at a 404 error 😆 ).</p><figure></figure><h3 id="component-descriptions-in-the-code-panel"><a href="#component-descriptions-in-the-code-panel">Component descriptions in the code panel</a></h3><p>The second tweak we made is with component descriptions. We now show them in the code panel, so developers can review any information you include.

To help streamline and speed up your prototype creation workflow, I collected a few of my favorite tips and tricks for you. Read on!</p><h2 id="_1-use-master-components-to-speed-up-prototype"><a href="#_1-use-master-components-to-speed-up-prototype">1. Use master components to speed up prototype connections</a></h2><p>Let&#39;s say you&#39;re designing a screen with some sort of persistent navigation, like a tab bar. You have to link each menu item to a specific frame (like linking the &#39;home&#39; button back to the home frame). If that menu is repeated across multiple screens, as tab bars often are, the tedious task of linking can take way longer than it should.</p><p>THERE&#39;S A BETTER WAY. Early in your process, turn your hamburger menu into a component. Once you&#39;ve done that, link each menu item of that master component to the appropriate frame. Moving forward, any time you create an instance of the hamburger component, all the connections will automatically propagate! No more beating your head against a wall with busy work.</p><p>One caveat: This doesn&#39;t work if you&#39;re dragging an instance of a component from a team library. Because the master component is located in a different file than yours, out of the gate, you won&#39;t be be able to leverage the previously mentioned tip.</p><p>Instead, create a new master component with the instance from your library inside it. Figma allows you to deep select down into the nested layers within each component, so you can still link multiple menu items from the instance without it detaching from the master. I often place some of these repeated components off to the side, outside my mockups, as a convenient place to access them and maintain the linked connections to different screens.</p><figure><figcaption>Link to Figma file</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_2-use-components-for-scrolling-content"><a href="#_2-use-components-for-scrolling-content">2. Use components for scrolling content</a></h2><p>When you&#39;re designing longer scrolling screens with fixed elements, such as status bars, headers or footers, you can simply drag the bottom of the frame down to accommodate the extra content. If the content exceeds the height of the viewport for the device you selected, Figma will automatically scroll the frame when in prototype mode. Handy, right?</p><p>But there are times when you want to see what&#39;s visible in the viewport by default (i.e. before the user scrolls). That gives you a sense of what content is initially cut off when users first navigate to that prototype frame. Devices with different viewport sizes will segment the content in different places. To make it easy to peruse these different views, use a component.</p><p>To see what content is initially visible in a scrollable frame:  </p><p>1) Turn your scrolling content into a component.2) Make sure you&#39;ve set up <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/54-constraints">constraints</a> for all of the elements inside.3) Ensure  &#34;clip content&#34; is checked in the properties panel (this should be enabled by default).4) Flip to prototyping mode and enable the scrolling direction you want by configuring the &#34;Overflow Behavior.&#34;5) Place an instance of this component within your designs and resize them to fit.   </p><p>Now you can get an idea of what is in view for each device size and manage all of your scrolling content centrally with a single component.</p><figure><figcaption>Link to Figma file</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_3-timed-delays-and-overlays-to-simulate"><a href="#_3-timed-delays-and-overlays-to-simulate">3. Timed delays and overlays to simulate interactions</a></h2><p>With prototypes, instant interactions can feel abrupt for the end user. You may want to add elements of realism, like simulating loading screens or adding a short delay. </p><p>One light-touch way you can use to do this is through the <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/199-getting-started-with-prototyping#triggers">after delay trigger</a>, where an interaction takes place after a set duration. Timed delays are especially useful when paired with <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/203-prototyping-with-overlays">overlays</a>, as you can see in the simple form example below. </p><p>Users expect the form to take them to a confirmation page, but if that happens too abruptly they may feel disoriented. By using overlays, with manual positioning and the swap overlay feature, we can create a simple button interaction in tandem with timed delays. The user then experiences a submit interaction, brief loading sequence and success message before the confirmation page appears.</p><figure><figcaption>Link to Figma file</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_4-a-table-of-contents"><a href="#_4-a-table-of-contents">4. A table of contents</a></h2><p>Prototypes in Figma are currently limited to single pages. This allows you to have separate prototypes in a single document, all with their own unique URLs that you can share with people when they want to view them. But sometimes, you just want to share one link to people that lets them see multiple design options.</p><p>To do this in Figma, create a table of contents frame as your prototype starting screen. Then, link each list item in the TOC to a different user flow. From the back-end Figma will interpret all of this as one prototype, but end users will experience them as different prototypes with a selection between them at the start. Note: All your user flows must be on the same page for this to work.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?rect=1,0,2449,1622&amp;w=693&amp;h=459&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 347w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 520w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 693w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1040w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/55448c902b659cea64829073b29dfb8ab90fd91e-2450x1622.jpg?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1386w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Link to Figma file</figcaption></figure><h2 id="_5-using-observation-mode"><a href="#_5-using-observation-mode">5. Using Observation Mode</a></h2><p>Do you know about <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-feature-highlight-observation-mode/">Observation Mode</a> in Figma? It lets you follow along with another person&#39;s screen while they present something or riff. You can click your collaborator&#39;s avatar in the top right corner of the editor to see everything they&#39;re seeing in a design file. </p><p>Observation Mode ALSO works with prototypes. You can click your collaborator&#39;s avatar to know where they are in the prototype and what they&#39;re doing. This is great for remote user tests when you want to study how a user is interacting with your design. It&#39;s also a great way to get everyone to follow along when presenting your work in a meeting.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="get-started-with-prototyping"><a href="#get-started-with-prototyping">Get started with prototyping</a></h2><p>I hope some of these tips will help you accelerate your prototyping process.

      <title>Looking to improve your Figma workflow? Check out our updated user forum</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/our-new-online-community/</link>
      <description>We’re relaunching our online forum with a new channel structure, a clearer set of guidelines, and community focused content like AMA’s, livestreams, and more!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Design is not a black-and-white endeavor, and most workflows are context-dependent. How do you set up a design system? How should you handle developer handoff? What should your toolchain look like? These are all subjective questions that can’t really be answered from support articles.</p><p>Designers naturally turn to each other for answers. Time and time again, whether through an in-person meetup or via a conversation on Twitter, we’ve seen the community hash out these topics collectively. Different people weigh in with unique perspectives based on their own experiences and situations. The resulting dialogue then helps both the person asking the question and the community at large.</p><p>We want to make it easier for our users to connect and learn from each other in this way. That’s why we’re excited about today’s news: We’re relaunching our online forum with updated channels, a clearer set of guidelines, and community focused content like AMA’s, livestreams, and more!</p><h2 id="new-channel-structure"><a href="#new-channel-structure">New Channel Structure</a></h2><p>The biggest change is the new channel structure in the forum. We&#39;ve archived a few, renamed a couple, and added some new ones all with the goal of focusing conversations on specific areas of practice. For example, we now have a &#34;Design Systems&#34; channel, which gives people a place to chat about best practices, ask questions about how other teams set up their libraries in Figma, and share resources. The same goes for new channels like &#34;Prototyping,&#34; &#34;API and Extensions,&#34; and &#34;Workflow and Process.&#34; </p><p>We&#39;ve also created a new channel called &#34;Open Design.&#34; This is a space for our users to share what they&#39;re working on, get feedback, and even find other designers to help on projects. After all, one of the most powerful things about Figma is that it&#39;s based in the browser and supports collaboration. Let&#39;s take advantage of that ;).</p><p>Lastly, you&#39;ll find a new &#34;Start Here&#34; channel for all things related to the forum. This will include threads with information on the new channel structure, our guidelines, code of conduct, etc. </p><h2 id="what-s-happening-to-bug-reports-and-feature"><a href="#what-s-happening-to-bug-reports-and-feature">What&#39;s happening to bug reports and feature requests?</a></h2><p>Along with the channel restructure, we&#39;re moving bug reports and feature requests out of the forum and funneling them through <a href="https://help.figma.com/#">our support platform</a>. Our team can respond much more promptly when you reach out through our proper support channel. They&#39;ll be able to work with you on a 1-1 basis to diagnose the issues at hand. Plus you&#39;ll be able to share files, account info, etc. that you might not be able to share publicly. </p><p>Our support team has processes in place for communicating bugs and feature requests to the proper people at Figma. They&#39;re able to tag conversations appropriately, and they meet on a weekly basis with our product and engineering teams to discuss priority. </p><p>Ultimately we hope that these changes will make it easier for you to connect, learn and share with each other.

      <title>Getting to the bottom of line height in Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/line-height-changes/</link>
      <description>We’re altering the way we handle text in Figma. Join me on the journey we took to get there — through type history and into the modern times.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Figma, we try to strike a balance between historic design principles, forged through the centuries, and new practices. Today marks another step on that journey: we’re altering the way we handle text. Figma will now distribute extra line height above and below letters, and it will measure line height in a more modern way. It’s a purely optional change — none of your existing files will change in any way, and you can choose whether to update old text at your own pace.</p><p>These modifications may seem simple; our path to get there was anything but. To find the right solution for our users, we dove into the beautifully complex world of type and vertical alignment, studying how laying out text evolved since Gutenberg, and how computers — first graphical user interfaces, then the web — further complicated the issues.</p><p>This historical baggage — and the fact that Figma is used in so many different ways — made it challenging to come up with one ideal solution. We did a lot of research and testing, and we&#39;re excited to introduce what we came up with. </p><p>If you’d like to get straight to the details, you can <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/line-height-changes/#changes-to-figma">jump to them</a> in this post or read about them in our <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/283-changes-to-line-height">support doc</a>. Alternatively, you can stay here and join me on our journey through type history and into the modern times. We’ll chat with the creators of CSS, shed a tear for OS/2, and hopefully get a better understanding of all the changes happening to Figma today.</p><h2 id="the-early-centuries-of-typesetting"><a href="#the-early-centuries-of-typesetting">The early centuries of typesetting</a></h2><p>Things were simpler in the days when type was made out of metal. There were two main roles — type designer and typesetter — and their work was constrained by the rules of the physical universe.</p><p>It also helped that by late 1800s, the type industry had figured out most of the basics. A life of a typeface would start on paper, with a type designer spending weeks or months sketching all the necessary letterforms. After they were done, the drawings of the typeface were turned into a font: actual physical blocks of lead.</p><p>You needed to buy one or more such blocks for each letter. You also needed to buy additional metal blocks for different sizes of text. But font size wasn’t defined as the size of the letters — it was the height of the metal block holding them, expressed in a unit known as point (each point was a 1/72 of an inch, or about 0.4mm). The block height was known, but within it, the type designer could do whatever they wanted: Fonts of the same size could be bigger or smaller, their baseline (the line each letter “sits” on) placed higher or lower, and so on.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;h=400&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ba172b2ca24c4f613ce07008d95f4364913f1a7d-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Four metal fonts with the same, 16pt font size.

One of these problems remains unsolved.</figcaption></figure><p>It was a relatively simple system, with clearly defined roles and rules. The font came from the type foundry as a monolithic, unchangeable block, and line height could only be added, never removed. Yes, you could order a font with an unusual line height built in, but that was uncommon. (Any such font came with a discouraging name — “bastard type”.) Your job was to lay things down and space them to your heart’s content.</p><h2 id="enter-pixels-enter-problems"><a href="#enter-pixels-enter-problems">Enter pixels, enter problems</a></h2><p>Then computers ruined it all. As we transitioned from paper and metal to screens and software, typography inherited everything that computers have to offer — including bugs, incompatibilities, and updates.</p><p>Fonts were no longer solid blocks of lead; instead, they arrived as collections of numbers packed into files. A type designer or type foundry also had to prepare their fonts in different file formats, subject to the requirements of early graphical platforms — Windows, Macintosh, and now-forgotten <a href="https://guidebookgallery.org/guis/os2">OS/2</a>. (Plus, the platform’s rendering of fonts was sometimes quirky or buggy, and type foundries had to adjust for that, too.)</p><p>Not everything was horrible, of course. Computers gave both type designers and typesetters unprecedented amounts of freedom. Pixels were subject to few of the restrictions of the metal universe — things could overlap at will, or stick out of their once-rigid boxes. As a typesetter, you could add as much leading as you needed without requiring any actual lead. Alternatively, you could remove said leading. Even all of it, if you so desired.</p><figure><figcaption>Adding and removing leading on the screen.</figcaption></figure><p>In the physical world, a box needed to have actual minimal dimensions, since leading could only be added.

Sharper-eyed among you might notice the leading numbers themselves are not aligned with the legends, hinting at the near future of alignment issues in the user interface.</figcaption></figure><p>Other programs did it slightly differently. Sometimes, instead of leading, they would ask you for line height (in this case 20 points). Or, you could instead say, “I want a line height of 100%”, and this would mean the font’s default line height as specified by the digital font designer — which could be 16 points, 20 points, or any other value.</p><figure><figcaption>Leading in design software.</figcaption></figure><p>Things evolved from there. As computer screens spread, they became a destination rather than a stopgap. More work was designed for screens themselves, and different needs arose. Particularly in user interface design, it became much more important to carefully center text vertically next to an icon, or an avatar — an issue that wasn’t as crucial in the world of print.</p><p>At the same time, some of the old traditions disappeared. Fonts and line heights started to be expressed more often in pixels, rather than points. Following the disappearance of lead, the word &#34;leading&#34; was slowly replaced with the more abstract term &#34;line spacing.&#34; (Thankfully, no one thought of “pixelling” or “electroning.”)</p><p>All the competing font standards converged, too. The industry invented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenType">OpenType</a>, the one unified type of font that could work everywhere.

First, they distributed the extra space that was once a strip of lead both above and below each line. They nicknamed the new system “<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS1/#the-height-of-lines">half-leading</a>.”</p><figure><figcaption>Leading on screens (left) and half-leading on the web (right)</figcaption></figure><p>I reached out to the creators of CSS to understand the rationale behind the change. They explained to me that while <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WD-css1-951117.html">early proposals for web style sheets matched the print universe</a>, they had good reasons for deciding to go with half-leading. Namely, web’s text boxes had more responsibilities. </p><p>In the world of print or early programs, a text box only needed to hold the text inside it. The web asked it to do more. “I was aware half-leading wasn’t a traditional typographic concept,” mentioned Bert Bos, who worked on CSS1 in 1995 and 1996. &#34;But the problem I had with adding leading only below the lines was what happened to a paragraph when you put a background behind it or a border around it.” </p><p>If leading appeared only at the bottom of such a box, that box would feel bottom-heavy and would require additional work to look good. Half-leading offered a way out of this new problem.</p><p>The other change CSS introduced? The 100% line height was redefined as “100% of font size.” Before, a font designer might have given a 16-pixel font a default line height of 20 pixels. But on the web, 100% line height of a 16-pixel font came to be exactly 16 pixels, regardless of what the original designer dictated.</p><p>The reason for that change was simple: knowing the default line height of a font required loading that font, which could be really slow on the early internet. Multiplying line height by font size, on the other hand, could be done immediately. “We wanted to do as many calculations as possible without having to load the font,” mentioned Håkon Wium Lie, co-creator of CSS. Line height no longer understood the font inside — luckily, the fonts weren’t required to fit within physical boxes, so that wasn’t that big of a problem.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;h=400&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5afd1489b84d04e9a584cbfbd6fdf16a222538f4-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>See the variety in four digital fonts with 16pt font size and 100% line height on the web.</figcaption></figure><p>And so, the same font as before would have a size of 16 pixels — but a line height of 20 pixels would now be expressed as 125% or 1.25, since 16×1.25 gives exactly 20.

What in the print era were absolute rules, now became suggestions. Positioning the text box exactly where you wanted it to be not only became harder — it was often discouraged. Web browsers, after all, could be found on vastly different computers, each one with a different screen and a different set of installed fonts.</p><p>Browsers, like platforms before them, now had to take some of the responsibilities for type rendering and typesetting — but, as you can imagine, they also came with their own sets of bugs and idiosyncrasies. Each one did things slightly differently: be it alignment, rounding pixels up or down, or interpreting the various incantations of CSS.</p><p>The history of web design can be seen as a set of tensions between designers wanting things to be positioned with utmost precision, and the web pushing back on some of that control. One of the unexpected casualties of that push and pull was line height.

And, on top of all the previously mentioned challenges, Figma came with its own unique set:</p><ul><li>people use Figma to design <em>on</em> different platforms</li><li>people use Figma to design <em>for</em> different platforms</li><li>people do all these things <em>while</em> working together (using multiplayer)</li><li>Figma exists in a larger ecosystem and needs to understand and respect it</li></ul><p>There is no longer one way to think of type…and yet Figma needs to think of type one way. We couldn’t render things differently on different platforms, because that would cause trouble for people collaborating on one file. We wanted to support designing for iOS devices in your Chromebook web browser, or Android apps on your Mac, but we didn’t want a set of toggles to make Figma’s type UI feel like one platform or the other. We needed to create a convenient, powerful UI – but also understand that often the end result of work in Figma lives elsewhere as CSS, or native source code.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9e197b0c86ab46d54bcb7f50f760bd5bf65b320c-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;h=400&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9e197b0c86ab46d54bcb7f50f760bd5bf65b320c-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9e197b0c86ab46d54bcb7f50f760bd5bf65b320c-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9e197b0c86ab46d54bcb7f50f760bd5bf65b320c-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9e197b0c86ab46d54bcb7f50f760bd5bf65b320c-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9e197b0c86ab46d54bcb7f50f760bd5bf65b320c-1340x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>To achieve all our goals, Figma needs to take ownership of the entire space — interpret font files, make decisions previously reserved for platforms and browsers, and narrow the space of design decisions.</figcaption></figure><p>Figma originally borrowed from the world of print: line spacing was added below and “100%” meant “font’s default line height.” Over time, however, it became increasingly obvious that this is less and less how people think of or use type. Instead, most expect fonts to behave like the web; our approach to fonts caused trouble in the handoff between design and engineering, and even in designing itself.</p><p>We heard from a lot of you that Figma’s approach to text was confusing, so we looked at it more carefully. We observed how people used Figma to design visuals and UIs for all sorts of platforms. We dug into the history of where different line height and typography interpretations came from. We built tools to help ourselves understand how different platforms use text (<a href="https://aresluna.org/line-height-playground">here is one you can play with that explores line height on different platforms</a>).</p><figure></figure><p>And we went through a lot of seedy alleys of typography, places I wouldn’t want you to ever encounter: rogue fonts, ridiculously tall text cursors, selections that overlapped or refused to.</p><figure><figcaption>Master Figma file with all our research on line height.</figcaption></figure><p>After all the research and conversations, we settled on a particular set of changes to how line height is treated inside Figma.

It’s easy to see that as messy or annoying, but one can also see it as beautiful and very human. I often look at typography that way, too, as a thing of infinite complexity, rich in history and meaning. I’m in awe of it all, and it feels like a privilege to be part of that journey. </p><p>We’ll keep working on Figma’s type and improving it, and I hope you&#39;ll continue to help us in doing so — just <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign">@ us on Twitter</a> or write to us at <a href="mailto:type@figma.com">type@figma.com</a>. </p><p>We’ll also have more exciting font news to announce soon. I can barely wait.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Learn how GitHub uses Figma to build its design system.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Where do developers go to build software? GitHub, of course, which is home to more than 31 million developers around the globe. Founded in 2008 and part of Microsoft since 2018, the GitHub development platform is where developers learn, share and work together to build amazing software. </p><p>The platform makes it easier for developers to work together, solve challenging problems, and create the world’s most important technologies. It does this by fostering a collaborative community that comes together—as individuals and in teams—to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.</p><p>“GitHub has a great culture of collaboration,” says Diana Mounter, design operations manager at GitHub. “But we’re also a remote company, with designers, engineers, product managers and others working from many different locations. We needed a way to break down the barriers to collaboration and creativity that can happen when you’re not sharing the same physical space as someone else.”</p><h2 id="growing-the-design-system-and-the-team-that"><a href="#growing-the-design-system-and-the-team-that">Growing the design system and the team that supports it</a></h2><p>When Mounter joined GitHub in 2015, the company didn’t have staff dedicated fulltime to a design system. “Designers had to recreate the same thing over and over, there was missing documentation, patterns were outdated, and other issues existed that people were trying to solve on their own,” says Mounter. “We decided to start a grassroots effort to streamline our processes with a design system and documented workflow.” Within six months of the start of the effort, a permanent team was formed, including Mounter and one other person. </p><p>That was then. Today, the design systems team has seven people (out of 25 on the overall product design team) dedicated to delivering reusable, interchangeable components to make the design process at GitHub efficient, repeatable and scalable. “Design systems have become core to the way we design and build at GitHub,” explains Mounter in an <a href="https://medium.com/@broccolini/design-systems-at-github-c8e5378d2542">article</a> she published.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9bad02b70d3a61f7b0ba9d470facb4bfc0039c08-1000x562.png?rect=1,0,999,562&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9bad02b70d3a61f7b0ba9d470facb4bfc0039c08-1000x562.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9bad02b70d3a61f7b0ba9d470facb4bfc0039c08-1000x562.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9bad02b70d3a61f7b0ba9d470facb4bfc0039c08-1000x562.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9bad02b70d3a61f7b0ba9d470facb4bfc0039c08-1000x562.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 999w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="fixing-the-bugs-in-the-design-workflow"><a href="#fixing-the-bugs-in-the-design-workflow">Fixing the bugs in the design workflow</a></h2><p>While having a dedicated team to build and maintain the design system helped address some of the design team’s efficiency and consistency issues, the workflow for the system and the tools required to support it were keeping the team from working efficiently and collaboratively on core components.  </p><p>“We had some painful steps in our workflow that made it restrictive and confusing for contributors who wanted to iterate or update things like icons in our SVG icon library,” says Jon Rohan, system designer and engineer at GitHub. “People needed to have specific software installed and knowledge of certain tools to make contributions.” </p><p>To resolve the issues with updating the icon library, called Octicons, GitHub kicked off an experiment with Figma. “We got excited about Figma because it didn&#39;t require downloading and installing software as part of the workflow to update icons,” says Mounter. </p><p>For Rohan, it was the combination of Figma and the Figma API that would allow GitHub to make the contributing experience as frictionless as possible. “By migrating Octicons to Figma and using the Figma API, we could automate the workflow, which allows people to contribute to the design system using powerful, platform-agnostic design tools without any complex setup.” For the full story on Octicons, checkout the <a href="https://github.blog/2018-04-12-driving-changes-from-designs/">GitHub blog</a>.  </p><p>Realizing the potential impact Figma could have on the team’s workflow, the design systems team began migrating its UI components to Figma as well. “Nearly everything that designers and developers need to build and design GitHub are now available in Figma,” says Mounter. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da3e86b3c60da8c4dda8b47893f1a0ea040c2df2-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da3e86b3c60da8c4dda8b47893f1a0ea040c2df2-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da3e86b3c60da8c4dda8b47893f1a0ea040c2df2-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da3e86b3c60da8c4dda8b47893f1a0ea040c2df2-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/da3e86b3c60da8c4dda8b47893f1a0ea040c2df2-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Image from: https://GitHub.com/primer/octicons</figcaption></figure><h2 id="creating-a-designhub-for-remote-collaboration"><a href="#creating-a-designhub-for-remote-collaboration">Creating a “DesignHub” for remote collaboration</a></h2><p>Although the team has always been tool-agnostic, Figma’s use began to spread like wildfire. As a remote team, the fact that Figma is web-based design enabled them to overcome the physical separation and begin collaborating in a very real and efficient way. </p><p>“Being able to jump in the same file with someone fills the gap of not being able to gather around a whiteboard with someone,” says Mounter. “Figma replaced the whiteboard for us.”  </p><p>Kathy Zheng, senior product designer at GitHub couldn’t agree more. “For the first time since joining GitHub, I can experience design collaboration and get all of the benefits of a team that&#39;s physically together. And perhaps it&#39;s even more fun than whiteboarding because you have powerful features at your fingertips.”<br/>For Zheng, Figma puts creativity back into the process. “No matter where you are in your design process, how do you play a little bit, so that you might stumble across something novel?” she asks. “The moment that I started doing design jams where I was jamming in Figma files with other designers, I got that feeling back, that by disseminating an idea, we can create gravity and momentum around it.”</p><p>Today Zheng uses Figma for “basically everything that revolves around storytelling.” Design is storytelling and prototyping puts a story in action. “Prototyping is now a integral part of my workflow because it is so easy,” she says. “I can quickly drag stuff around to suggest the flow I&#39;m designing for without switching tools.”</p><div><blockquote><p>GitHub is a space for collaboration. Everything that we build, the features and the tooling, should enable that collaboration. Figma is a natural tool for us to use because it embraces and supports collaboration between designers and engineers.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="accelerating-feedback-for-faster-delivery-cycles"><a href="#accelerating-feedback-for-faster-delivery-cycles">Accelerating feedback for faster delivery cycles</a></h2><p>Designers like Zheng appreciate how Figma improves and accelerates the feedback cycle, lowering the barrier for non-designers to participate. “At GitHub, we’re always closely collaborating with our project and engineering teams,” says Zheng. “The more we invite engineering into our feedback cycle, the better the outcome for both parties and the shorter the overall cycle.”  </p><p>Ash Guillaume, graphic designer at GitHub, agrees. “I can instantly take my design and share the link with any of my team members,” he says. “They can open it in Figma and give me feedback through the commenting system, speeding up the feedback loop.”</p><p>Rohan from the design system team believes that sharing more than a screenshot is essential to communicating and getting feedback. “People can look at the actual design, which is super valuable for us because we ship incremental, early and often, and the speed and momentum to make changes quickly is crucial,” he says. “A lot of engineers love being able to go to a Figma link and see designs and prototypes.”</p><h2 id="seeing-success-spread-across-the-company"><a href="#seeing-success-spread-across-the-company">Seeing success spread across the company</a></h2><p>When asked about the success of Figma at GitHub, first and foremost for Mounter is how it helps the design systems team. “With Figma, it’s easier to keep our design system up to date,” she says. “But I think the other measure of success is just seeing more engineers and product managers joining in and finding it useful to collaborate with designers. The ultimate success is seeing Figma usage spread across the GitHub organization.”</p><p>Figma helps designers at GitHub expose more about what happens between the start of an idea and the finished design. According to Mounter, “there&#39;s less of a barrier to getting access to work-in-progress for people outside of the design team which means more people can participate and more innovation happens.” </p><p>That collaboration is at the heart of what GitHub has always been about — creating something amazing by bringing individuals and teams together in one place.</p><div><blockquote><p>Another designer and I were jamming together in a Figma design file, just exploring, having fun and bouncing ideas off of each other. When someone else joined in and saw all the work that we were doing, it started new conversations that wouldn&#39;t have happened otherwise. That&#39;s something that I haven&#39;t experienced in any other design software.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Our grid pro quo: Everything you need to know about layout grids in Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-layout-grids-in-figma/</link>
      <description>Learn how layout grids in Figma can become a powerful enhancement to your design workflow.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As an aspiring designer, one of the first proper books I purchased was Josef Müller-Brockmann&#39;s <a href="https://www.niggli.ch/en/grid-systems-in-graphic-design.html">Grid Systems in Graphic Design</a>. The book was fascinating to me because it helped codify the many ways a grid could provide structure and consistency, improve  readability, and create emphasis and hierarchy in design. It&#39;s the first text to formalize many of these concepts into such concise words, and it&#39;s probably one of the most important tomes on the topic. In the design world, there&#39;s a common joke that you can tell how long someone has been a designer by the color of the spine of their Müller-Brockmann copy.</p><p>By carefully constructing a grid that&#39;s suitable to your content, you can define structure, hierarchy, and rhythm in your design. When done right, the scaffolding of grids can remove the guess work from many aspects of your process. Different types of grids can also help you establish a rational approach to type scales, positioning, sizing and spacing. </p><p>Although these principles originated in the relatively &#34;rigid&#34; medium of print, I remain convinced now more than ever of their importance. In the era of screen design, grids can be instrumental in establishing consistency across a wide variety of device and viewport sizes, especially for teams that need to create a cohesive design experience for multiple products and platforms.</p><p>Despite all the benefits of grid systems, for a long time I struggled to configure grids effectively in my own design process—they often didn&#39;t provide me with the flexibility I wanted (in other design tools). So you can imagine my happiness when I discovered how <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/55-layout-grids">layout grids</a> worked in Figma. Figma offered added functionality like styles that removed much of the friction I had previously experienced. </p><p>In Figma, you can apply more than one grid as a property to any frame (and independently toggle its visibility). That was a game changer, and quickly became an essential part of my workflow. In speaking with other Figma users, I learned that many still hadn&#39;t had the lightbulb moment I did in uncovering the useful capabilities of this feature. So, I thought I&#39;d share a few ways that I use layout grids to speed up my design process, from resizing frames to visualizing spacing and padding.</p><p>Consider this post a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quid_pro_quo">grid quo pro</a>...in return, all I want is for you to spread the word to other Grid Newbies out there! (Excuse the dad joke...could not help myself 🤣.)</p><h2 id="layout-grid-basics"><a href="#layout-grid-basics">Layout grid basics</a></h2><p>Before I dive into the more advanced use cases, let&#39;s cover the basics of where and how you apply grids. If you&#39;re a grid pro, skip ahead to the next section.</p><p><strong>Apply a layout grid to any frame</strong> - Layout grids can only be applied to <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/64-groups-frames">frames</a>; this means you can apply them to any top level frames sized for a device (desktop, mobile, tablet), frames nested within your design, or even frames inside your components.</p><p><strong>Multiple grids on a frame</strong> - You can add as many different layout grids to a frame. This means you could stack different types of grids on a single frame. Each of those grids can also be selected and pasted onto other frames since they are applied like other properties in the right hand sidebar.</p><p><strong>Grid appearance</strong> - You can control the appearance (color and opacity) of each grid so they are easily differentiated.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="types-of-grids"><a href="#types-of-grids">Types of grids</a></h3><p>There are three different forms of grids to choose from: grid (uniform grid), column, and row. Uniform grids create a series of uniformly spaced fields across your frame (imagine a sheet grid paper) at whatever size you specify. The others have a few more options to create columns and rows. Within column and row grids you can also control their position and scaling behavior. We cover most of this in <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/55-layout-grids">our help center article</a>, so we won&#39;t go into all the details, but here is quick cheatsheet to highlight some of the key differences.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8d25895bcfc35682f2880dbe244cfaf5e65b95d-2156x2516.png?w=670&amp;h=782&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8d25895bcfc35682f2880dbe244cfaf5e65b95d-2156x2516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8d25895bcfc35682f2880dbe244cfaf5e65b95d-2156x2516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8d25895bcfc35682f2880dbe244cfaf5e65b95d-2156x2516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8d25895bcfc35682f2880dbe244cfaf5e65b95d-2156x2516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8d25895bcfc35682f2880dbe244cfaf5e65b95d-2156x2516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="baseline-grids"><a href="#baseline-grids">Baseline grids</a></h2><p>A baseline grid is one that&#39;s established from the baselines your typography sits on. These appear as visual aids in your design spanning the width of your design and repeating vertically at an even internal. What that interval is, is largely dependent on your typography scales and line-heights. In many 8pt grid systems, a 4pt baseline is used. This basic unit makes the math easy and scalable as you start to setup different type sizes and line-height combinations. </p><p>Using one can help you align one piece of type to another while giving you a unit of measure to help establish the sizing and spacing of other elements. In many design systems, such as <a href="https://material.io/design/layout/spacing-methods.html#baseline">Google&#39;s Material Design</a>, the baseline grid is a foundational part of defining type size and line-height parings, as well as spacing for margins and padding.</p><p>If you&#39;ve ever wanted to create a baseline grid in Figma, there are a couple of different ways to do so using a row grid.</p><ol><li>A grid that is built around line-heights</li><li>A grid that is built around the actual baseline that text sits on</li></ol><p>Since you have some control over the appearance of your grids, you can create the right kind of grid for either approach. By using a row grid, with the type set to &#34;Top&#34;, we can create the foundation for a baseline grid. Usually it&#39;s a good idea to set the row count to a high number that will allow you to accommodate longer scrolling frames. From there you can choose to highlight alternating rows, or thin lines using a combination of the height, gutter, and color properties as illustrated below.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670&amp;h=476&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/398fe9d7ae24161bba06f981a90d768fc007e4ef-2156x1532.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The grid settings above illustrate how you can take different approaches to styling a baseline grid.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="nested-grids"><a href="#nested-grids">Nested grids</a></h2><p>Now that we&#39;ve covered the basics, let&#39;s take a look at how we can combine them, share them, and use them in a variety of ways.</p><h3 id="nested-grids"><a href="#nested-grids">Nested grids</a></h3><p>Unlike other tools, you won&#39;t be limited to a single grid at the &#34;artboard&#34; level.

So if you wanted an element to stay pinned to the top right of a frame (like a close button), applying constraints will ensure that the element maintains its distance from the top and right without changing its size as the frame grows or contracts.</p><p>In contrast, when you apply constraints to an element inside a frame that has a layout grid, your constraints will be relative to their nearest column (instead of the boundaries of the parent frame). When used with stretch grids, this will allow your elements to stay fixed to columns or rows and maintain a fixed space (gutter) between them. It results in much more realistic scaling behavior, as you can see in the gif below.</p><figure><figcaption>By setting constraints appropriately, you can resize items relative to the layout grid, which helps you maintain fixed column gutters and margins. </figcaption></figure><p>By setting constraints appropriately, you can resize items relative to the layout grid, which helps you maintain fixed column gutters and margins. </p><p>Using the same method, we can add constraints to our previous example that highlighting nested frames (each with their own grids).

You can create grids to help with that by styling a column and a row grid with a single row/column, setting the gutters to 0 and the margin to your preferred spacing. If your design system has standardized spacing values for padding, you can quickly add these and apply them to frames or components within your design.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c21365ec80ece7772b723a444c55a5f0e8a88ca-2156x832.png?rect=2,0,2152,832&amp;w=670&amp;h=259&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c21365ec80ece7772b723a444c55a5f0e8a88ca-2156x832.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c21365ec80ece7772b723a444c55a5f0e8a88ca-2156x832.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c21365ec80ece7772b723a444c55a5f0e8a88ca-2156x832.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c21365ec80ece7772b723a444c55a5f0e8a88ca-2156x832.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c21365ec80ece7772b723a444c55a5f0e8a88ca-2156x832.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="sharing-grids-with-styles"><a href="#sharing-grids-with-styles">Sharing grids with styles</a></h2><p>As you&#39;re creating grids, you might want to make different variations for layouts on different device sizes or other common use cases.

      <title>We refreshed Figma&#39;s UI: An inside look at our process</title>

      <description>From typography and layout to color and iconography, you’ll notice a lot of subtle differences throughout the tool.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past half year, we’ve been working on a fresh coat of paint for Figma’s UI, and today is the big reveal. From typography and layout to color and iconography, you’ll notice a lot of subtle differences throughout the tool.</p><p>Our goal was to make this refresh as unobtrusive as possible. We focused primarily on surface changes instead of structural, and did months of qualitative and quantitative research. We had long and deep internal discussions over the details, to make sure different teams were onboard with the final product.</p><p>It’s impossible to please everyone with a redesign—and designers are, of course, particularly sensitive to this kind of thing. With this article, we wanted to give you high-level insight into why we made the changes we did, the process we took to get there, and the lessons we learned along the way. (We didn&#39;t get into the nitty gritty of the modifications though — you&#39;ll see them yourself when you open Figma!)</p><p>Sooner or later, most products have to go through a visual refresh of some sort, so we also shared a few tools and templates to help you get started on a similar journey.</p><h2 id="it-s-time-for-a-redesign"><a href="#it-s-time-for-a-redesign">It&#39;s time for a redesign</a></h2><p>So, how do you know when it’s time to take on a redesign? There’s not usually one lightning-bolt moment, when the skies open up and Design Zeus peers down to proclaim: “It’s time!” Instead, much like a lobster in a pot of boiling water, the pressure builds slowly over time.</p><p>At Figma, we had a steadily growing sense that our UI didn’t work as well today as it did yesterday. We found ourselves inventing components on the fly—and building bespoke solutions for new features when the existing elements didn’t fit our needs. As a result, we wound up with an endless variation of tables, buttons and input controls, and multiple shades of grey, red and blue throughout the tool. </p><p>Our users notice inconsistencies and aesthetic details, and we do too. We’d discuss one off issues in casual conversations, which eventually snowballed to informal group chats. </p><p>It wasn’t surprising that we kept running up against the limitations of our original system. After all, the last time we holistically reviewed our interface, Figma didn’t have Multiplayer or Components. In other words, we built the foundation of our UI before Figma was even <em>Figma</em>. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7efd405448f49772e5bd3c74b2049a70975956a0-1340x495.png?rect=1,0,1337,495&amp;w=670&amp;h=248&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7efd405448f49772e5bd3c74b2049a70975956a0-1340x495.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7efd405448f49772e5bd3c74b2049a70975956a0-1340x495.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7efd405448f49772e5bd3c74b2049a70975956a0-1340x495.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7efd405448f49772e5bd3c74b2049a70975956a0-1340x495.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7efd405448f49772e5bd3c74b2049a70975956a0-1340x495.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1337w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Eventually our concerns around UI coalesced and we decided to do something about it. We scheduled a two-hour brainstorming session with the entire design team where we came together to catalogue the quirks and shortcomings of our UI, as well as things we really liked.</p><p>We spent a while playing around with Figma on our computers, getting into the nooks and crannies of the product. We took notes and screenshots of everything we noticed and threw it all into (what else?) a Figma file.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a3cff74ad56c84a339c17b23bf4737a0e157297-1340x641.png?rect=0,0,1340,640&amp;w=670&amp;h=320&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a3cff74ad56c84a339c17b23bf4737a0e157297-1340x641.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a3cff74ad56c84a339c17b23bf4737a0e157297-1340x641.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a3cff74ad56c84a339c17b23bf4737a0e157297-1340x641.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a3cff74ad56c84a339c17b23bf4737a0e157297-1340x641.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a3cff74ad56c84a339c17b23bf4737a0e157297-1340x641.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>After an hour or so, the team talked about different things we found, transferring the verbal notes into a shared text document as we went around the room. When everyone in the group had a resounding reaction to something (the “oh shit that’s bad” moment), we noted it, gathering early signal on what might have a large impact.</p><p>Then, we took a few days away from the information overload.

PHEW.</li></ul><p>We then made the mistake of trying to layer another dimension on top of that, arranging these categories along an axis from visual → foundational. Ultimately that was too complicated.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2284a540e05c0cd0ef06e9619d7d8245851520b5-1340x1035.jpg?rect=1,0,1339,1035&amp;w=670&amp;h=518&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2284a540e05c0cd0ef06e9619d7d8245851520b5-1340x1035.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2284a540e05c0cd0ef06e9619d7d8245851520b5-1340x1035.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2284a540e05c0cd0ef06e9619d7d8245851520b5-1340x1035.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2284a540e05c0cd0ef06e9619d7d8245851520b5-1340x1035.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2284a540e05c0cd0ef06e9619d7d8245851520b5-1340x1035.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1339w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><em>Learn from our mistake</em>: In your own visual refresh brainstorm, don’t overthink your organization. Try to find categories that make sense and aren’t too abstract. For example, the ‘personality’ of the product is way too high-level of a theme, because almost everything fits into that. Don’t make your categories too specific either (like focusing solely on one type of dialog box).</p><p>At the end of the meeting, each Figma designer took one of the themes and typed them back into that same shared text document, now neatly organized by category.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b7fded22550a1defaa1073d93b9999904b35677-1340x300.png?w=670&amp;h=150&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b7fded22550a1defaa1073d93b9999904b35677-1340x300.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b7fded22550a1defaa1073d93b9999904b35677-1340x300.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b7fded22550a1defaa1073d93b9999904b35677-1340x300.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b7fded22550a1defaa1073d93b9999904b35677-1340x300.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9b7fded22550a1defaa1073d93b9999904b35677-1340x300.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="step-three-reducing-the-scope"><a href="#step-three-reducing-the-scope">Step three: Reducing the scope</a></h3><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ccdadb3a00f46f64296cf36dcc95fdc1c7ad62cd-1340x495.png?rect=1,0,1337,495&amp;w=670&amp;h=248&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ccdadb3a00f46f64296cf36dcc95fdc1c7ad62cd-1340x495.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ccdadb3a00f46f64296cf36dcc95fdc1c7ad62cd-1340x495.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ccdadb3a00f46f64296cf36dcc95fdc1c7ad62cd-1340x495.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ccdadb3a00f46f64296cf36dcc95fdc1c7ad62cd-1340x495.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ccdadb3a00f46f64296cf36dcc95fdc1c7ad62cd-1340x495.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1337w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>We knew we collected far too much in our brainstorming meetings. Fixing all those things could take us two years or more — a cost we couldn’t afford as a quickly growing startup.</p><p>So, in our third meeting we decided to scope the project with a rather simple thought experiment: If we only had a week, what’s the one thing we’d fix? People in the room immediately had answers, which gave us clarity on the right direction.</p><p>We realized that surface-level changes would solve a lot of the most pressing shortcomings in our UI. When we looked in detail: “Why doesn’t this work here?” the answer would often be something along the lines of: “We never built a pop-up window with multiple options, so we customized many different pop-up windows to meet our needs.” </p><p>Our componentry no longer supported the things we were doing, because the things we were doing had changed so much since 2015. </p><p>At the same time, we realized that the fundamental structure of Figma — in terms of the information architecture — worked pretty well and we had fairly few issues with it. Yes, perhaps we could transition between comments mode or other modes more seamlessly, but those weren’t “pants on fire” problems as it were.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670&amp;h=350&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04a2d2eda5c610960e6de8ce1d455a7e0e521cfc-1340x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>If you’re considering scoping your own redesign project, it’s worth analyzing which path to take upfront. There are three options to consider:</p><ol><li><em>Surface:</em> Focus on how things appear in the UI, such as input controls, icons, typography, button behavior, and so on.</li><li><em>Foundation:</em> Focus on how things fit together and the underlying mental model, like modality and information architecture.</li><li><em>Hybrid of surface and foundation:</em> You could make both surface-level and structural changes, but only for part of the product (otherwise you’re doing it all).</li></ol><p>At Figma, we felt like we’d have a broader impact if the refresh touched the entire product, so we chose path #1 — focus on improving the UI surface.</p><p>To narrow our scope even more, we decided roughly how much time we wanted to spend on it. We were willing to devote 3 people full-time, from engineering, design and product management, for a 5-month span. That constraint helped us make a lot of choices upfront. Namely, we decided that this was not going to be a complete UI overhaul, but rather a <em>visual refresh</em>. A fresh coat of paint or new furniture but no moving of walls.</p><p>Of course, it was painful to make that call. As designers our job is to care about these things (and as designers crafting a tool for other designers, we <em>know</em> you notice all the details). But we ultimately couldn’t solve it all given our time constraints. This was, perhaps, the biggest lesson of the UI refresh: We had to be ok with letting go.</p><p><em>Learn from our experience</em>: When a group of designers starts talking about a wish list of UI changes, things can get out of control, fast. Unchecked tinkering can be a never-ending task, so one of the most crucial steps when you’re contemplating a redesign is to figure out how to scope it. Ask yourselves: </p><ul><li>If you only had one week to tackle this project, what would you fix?</li><li>Are your biggest issues on the surface, or are they built into the structure of your product?</li><li>How much time are you willing to spend on this?</li></ul><h2 id="next-research-what-you-re-in-for"><a href="#next-research-what-you-re-in-for">Next, research what you’re in for</a></h2><p>Once we decided to stick with a surface level refresh of Figma, we spent the next couple weeks doing research to prepare. We assigned working groups of 3-4 people to tackle each of the main themes synthesized from the post-it note exercise:</p><ol><li>Color</li><li>Typography and iconography</li><li>Spacing, grids and metrics</li></ol><p>The goal was to explore the ideas and directions possible in each category by studying how we do things currently in Figma and how other software handles similar challenges. Each group created a Figma file of findings, with their own proposal for changes. For example, the team working on color proposed that we increase the contrast or depth of “Figma blue” so it would be easier to read in combination with white.</p><p>They all kept in mind four main goals for the project:</p><ol><li><em>Modernizing the UI.</em> Times change and expectations change, that is simply a fact. What feels dated about our UI? How do we separate out trends from legitimate progression and improvements from what feels current and contemporary?</li><li><em>Legibility &amp; Accessibility.</em> There are a lot of methods and philosophies for analyzing readability and contrast. We decided that what was most important was to pick one method for color contrast and be consistent, and we went with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG2</a>. Typography was another topic in this category.</li><li><em>Simplicity.</em> As the product has gotten richer and more complex, it was time to look at how we could reduce the number of patterns in use. For example: Did we have the right kinds of user input controls? Did our UI labeling system allow expressing hierarchy in a clear and concise way? Did we have too much going on in the toolbar?</li><li><em>Usability.</em> We wanted to focus on ease of use and understanding, so we looked at discoverability in the product. Could people find the components sidebar with just an icon in a corner? Is it easy and straight-forward to navigate between pages of a document?</li></ol><p>There was also an unmentioned goal: could we move cheese without people noticing in a negative way? If users couldn’t immediately say what changed, maybe that was a sign that we had pulled the visual refresh off well.</p><h2 id="now-comes-the-real-work"><a href="#now-comes-the-real-work">Now comes the real work</a></h2><p>After a few weeks, the teams got together again and presented their findings. We discussed proposed suggestions and agreed on the general changes we wanted to make (but didn’t determine prescriptive solutions). For example, we agreed: “This current Figma blue isn’t working,” but we didn’t decide what blue to use instead.</p><p>Once we’d agreed on those high-level conclusions, we assigned one specific designer (me!) to champion the UI refresh project, and one front-end engineer to build it.</p><p>It was the right call to involve the whole design team in this early brainstorming and prioritization process. That way, everyone was bought into the decisions we implemented and had context on the changes coming down the pipeline.</p><p>The rest of the project proceeded how you might imagine.  Although only one designer was dedicated to it full-time, we did daily check-ins with the rest of the design team, plus more formal design crits three times a week. We talked about the work on an ongoing basis so no one was caught off guard.</p><h3 id="living-with-your-decisions"><a href="#living-with-your-decisions">Living with your decisions</a></h3><p>With a project like this, you have to live with your designs to know your decisions are right. So early on, we set a tight deadline to finish a smaller version of the refresh that we could test internally. (Figma relies on a private staging environment in our day-to-day work to help us catch bugs before we ship to the public.) </p><p>Specifically, we made typography, color and grid changes to the “base layer” of the UI in the editor — those are the parts which are always on screen, like the toolbar and properties sidebar. Once our engineers built it, we started using the changes internally to see what worked as expected and what...didn’t.</p><p><em>Another lesson</em>: If you choose to dog-food your own redesign in stages, be prepared for things to get messy. For example, we would make a change to part of a toolbar but nothing else. Understandably, it would look frankensteined until we shipped other aspects of the refresh. We recommend you over-communicate to the rest of the company what they should expect via in-person meetings and Slack/email messages. </p><p>After making more progress throughout the product, we conducted several phases of user research to ensure our refresh didn’t cause any big problems or issues. We knew people wouldn’t be <em>thrilled</em> with the shift — in many products, redesigns are often met with skepticism from the existing community. But we wanted to make sure we didn’t actively harm our users with the changes.</p><p>There was a lot more to this project that I wish I could share with you, but it might take another 3,000 words to do so.</p><p>For now, we’ll leave you with the most important lesson of all. If you’re undergoing your own UI revamp, set up your project with a clear and doable scope...lest you toil forever in the land of the redesign.</p><p>I hope you enjoy the updated face of Figma :–).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Welcome to our #FigmaTip Roundup: Spring Edition where we pull our favorite Figma mini-lessons from the design community.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Who ever said you had to limit spring cleaning to your bathroom drawers?</p><p>The sun is shining, flowers are blooming, and your Figma files are hankering for some love. Give &#39;em the &#39;ol <a href="https://konmari.com/pages/about">KonMari treatment</a>, with this latest installment of Figma Tips. </p><p>We gathered all the best techniques to tidy up your Figma world, like using frames to organize components or shortcuts to rename your layers en masse. See what sparks joy in your designs with these ideas and more.</p><h2 id="batch-rename"><a href="#batch-rename">Batch Rename</a></h2><p>In every epic, long-standing design project, the <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/30-layers-panel">layers panel</a> deteriorates over time. You create, duplicate, and adjust a ton of layers, with a lot of them being similar or related, and as a result, your layers panel becomes a sea of names lost without context. However, to fix this, it can be quite a painful process to go back, one by one, renaming everything to your liking.</p><p>This is where our batch rename feature comes in handy! With a few clicks, you can give all of your layers the proper names they deserve.</p><p>To use it, start by selecting multiple layers then right-click and select Rename or use the keyboard shortcut <code>Command + R</code>. </p><figure></figure><p>From here you have a few options:</p><ol><li>Rename everything with the same name</li><li>Add a numerical suffix (shown above)</li><li>Add a prefix</li><li>Rename part of the layer&#39;s name.</li><li>Use Regular Expressions for even more control over naming. (advanced)</li></ol><p>I highly recommend checking out our <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/180-rename-layers">help article</a> on bulk renaming as it dives deeper into each of these options. </p><h2 id="add-custom-thumbnail-image"><a href="#add-custom-thumbnail-image">Add custom thumbnail image</a></h2><p>When you add a custom thumbnail image to your Figma files, it can greatly help in keeping things organized and easily scannable. We know this <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figmatip-roundup-8-0/">Figma tip</a> has been shared before, but it&#39;s so useful we thought it was worth publicizing again! You can create custom thumbnails for your files through a few simple steps. </p><ol><li>Create a new page and move it to the top of the pages list.

      <title>Pairing is the key to evangelizing your design system</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/pairing-is-the-key-to-evangelizing-your-design-system/</link>
      <description>Pairing with other designers lets you gather high level data about what is and isn&#39;t working well with your system of components and design patterns.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the hardest parts about building a design system is convincing other people to use it. It&#39;s easy to fall into the &#34;us vs. them&#34; trap by constantly calling out &#34;bad behavior&#34;: <em>Don&#39;t use blue. Don&#39;t put that there. Make sure that works on mobile. Don&#39;t write CSS like that. This form is not accessible. Why did you need a new component there?</em> </p><p>If you&#39;re not careful, this attitude can lead to a poisonous culture in your design org. <br/>A design systems team needs to focus on more than just being right; they have to be helpful, too.</p><p>This lesson took me a painful amount of time to figure out. When I first started a design system project at Gusto I believed that tools or process improvements would solve our inconsistencies. We needed a UI Kit! We needed a Component Library! At least that&#39;s what everyone talks about in blog posts and Medium articles; I thought that if I could just sit alone in a dark room then I could build our design system all by myself.</p><p>But it turns out a design system can&#39;t be perfected in solitude because it&#39;s rooted in human relationships. It serves as a mirror for the company, a reflection of the dynamics at play between designers, engineers, product managers and even customers. </p><p>Once I realized this, I knew we — on the design system team — needed a new approach to managing communication around and implemention of the system. We began to treat the design system as a cultural project instead of a technical one. We created a Slack-focused channel for feedback and questions, held office hours with the design systems team, and assembled an &#34;Introduction to our UI&#34; kit for newcomers.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?rect=1,0,1998,1306&amp;w=670&amp;h=438&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/62703b7c8054b01006b64a7eba29f18ebd760957-2000x1306.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>This is the introduction to our UI Kit in Figma for new employees and designers who want to learn more about what&#39;s possible.</figcaption></figure><p> These steps were helpful, but by far the effective approach to evangelizing the design system was through pairing.</p><p>Ideally other designers at the company should feel like we&#39;re placing rocket boosters on their designs, rather than shackling their creativity. But that&#39;s only possible by working closely with them — sitting with them and getting to know them not only as designers but as people, too.</p><h2 id="pairing-is-user-research"><a href="#pairing-is-user-research">Pairing is user research</a></h2><p>I treat pairing like user research. Working side-by-side with someone gives me a good idea of how they handle our design components and patterns, and what documentation is missing from our codebase and design files in Figma. I can see what parts of the design system are confusing for people, what&#39;s weird and what&#39;s working well. This information then helps us evolve componentry to meet their needs (instead of us assuming we know what those needs are).  </p><div><blockquote><p>You have this wonderful opportunity to reset the social contract between you and the designer.</p></blockquote></div><p>While pairing, I&#39;m confronted with questions like this:</p><ul><li>Do our designers and engineers know about our component library? </li><li>Are they familiar with the latest best practices around HTML and CSS?</li><li>Can my team do a better job explaining why using component X is beneficial to the organization as a whole? </li><li>Can I steal this layout from the designer and make it an official pattern for everyone to adopt in the future?</li></ul><p>Other design teams use office hours to answer questions like this, but when we started holding our own we found that they weren&#39;t quite as popular as we&#39;d hoped. Designers and engineers often don&#39;t know when they need us, so they don&#39;t come to our office hours proactively.</p><h2 id="pairing-turns-critique-into-collaboration"><a href="#pairing-turns-critique-into-collaboration">Pairing turns critique into collaboration</a></h2><p>The second benefit of pairing is that it opens communication between the design systems team and other people at the company. </p><p>As I hinted at earlier, collaborating with the design systems team shouldn&#39;t feel like another critique. Instead, it should feel like you&#39;re moving 80 times faster and preventing a ton of future bugs and issues from popping up. A designer working with us should feel confident that their work is of going to be of a higher standard and quality.</p><p>That&#39;s the dream at least. In reality, when a design systems team first forms everything is likely to be overly complex and undocumented. A lot of our codebase at Gusto is imprinted in our memory because we&#39;ve spent years rummaging around trying to understand and refactor it.</p><p>The codebase can and can&#39;t do stuff, and those constraints aren&#39;t always visible. Folks on the team might be unaware that there&#39;s a limited set of colors to choose from, or that there&#39;s a component that already exists that can solve this exact use case, or that we should avoid building <em>this thing</em> in <em>this way</em> because it violates our accessibility standards.</p><div><blockquote><p>Side note: if the motto of improv is: &#34;Yes, and…&#34; then the motto of design systems is surely: &#34;Yes, but…&#34;</p></blockquote></div><p>But it can be dangerous to initiate all those rules and dump all that overhead on people. It can make you sound like an annoying control freak — engineers will begin to ignore your docs and designers will continue to go off into the wilderness and make interfaces that might not complement what already exists.</p><p>Pairing helps lessens that tension and animosity. During pairing sessions, the design system team can teach others the institutional knowledge we have stashed away in our noggins and prevent more information from being silo&#39;d away into different teams.</p><p>It gives us this wonderful opportunity to reset the social contract between us and other designers. What feels like another round of burdensome design critique during office hours will often feel like a more collaborative, productive conversation whilst pairing.  It&#39;s then suddenly possible to make significant improvements to the system without any of the silly drama.</p><p>And so we both win in this scenario! We both get work done much faster and in a more collaborative spirit — product designers will learn about our system of front-end components and patterns whilst we get a better understanding of what they need to do their job well.</p><h2 id="pairing-creates-more-design-system-evangelists"><a href="#pairing-creates-more-design-system-evangelists">Pairing creates more design system evangelists</a></h2><p>There&#39;s one last big benefit worth mentioning about pairing: It creates more evangelists for the design system. Once a pairing session is over, the designer/engineer often passes those lessons on to the next person on their team.</p><div><blockquote><p>A lot of folks won&#39;t know when they need you.</p></blockquote></div><p>Trading knowledge in this way is important because we desperately need someone on every team to act as a translator. We need the person that can dive deep into the codebase and map its outlines and eccentricities, then help other designers and engineers understand it.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="-OqVyuoiJ87-" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>This community building work is certainly tough.</p><p>It requires a ton of energy because, as I mentioned before, a lot of folks won&#39;t know when they need you. They won&#39;t know if an interface is inaccessible or that another component exists already. They might not be able to make that trade-off between design impact and engineering cost. </p><p>Pairing lets you bridge that gap (and make a ton of friends along the way!). </p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="qphZ6bIn1Yzt" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Also? <a href="https://gusto.com/about/careers">Gusto is hiring</a> front-end engineers and designers to join our team and build this wonderful community around design systems together.

      <title>Now you can open links in the Figma desktop app</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-desktop-app-improvements/</link>
      <description>And a few other fun treats for our desktop app users.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Although Figma is first and foremost a web tool, our desktop app gets its fair share of love from the community. If you hoard dozens of tabs in your browser, it&#39;s nice to have a window dedicated solely to Figma.</p><p>With that said, we&#39;re excited to share a few updates to that desktop experience:</p><ul><li>You can now set up Figma URLs to open in the desktop app automatically</li><li>You can change your color space to sRGB (Mac OS)</li><li>We streamlined our UI for Windows users to give them more screen space for designing</li></ul><p>Read on for more details on the changes.</p><h2 id="links-can-now-open-in-the-desktop-app"><a href="#links-can-now-open-in-the-desktop-app">Links can now open in the desktop app</a></h2><p>One of Figma&#39;s super-powers is the ability to share source-of-truth files with a link. Those links can be embedded into word processing docs, posted on Slack or saved in task management tickets, making it easy for people to stay up to date on the design progress. </p><p>Before now, those links automatically opened in the browser, taking users into Chrome, Firefox or Safari instead of our app. Figma desktop fans built menu bar apps and browser extensions to get around that. (A big thanks to those who shared their work so the community could use it!)</p><p>Now, Figma will natively handling opening links on desktop. Update your desktop app, click any Figma URL, and check &#34;always open in the app&#34; from the dialogue box that pops up. If you ever change your mind, go to preferences in the top left menu of a Figma file and uncheck &#34;open links in desktop app.&#34; </p><p>Pro tip: If you keep your browser as the default, you can always open a Figma URL in your desktop app manually. Just go to the top left menu of the file and select &#34;open in desktop app.&#34;</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c8b47f6df2f0ff82d055817e671c239c8b5145d1-2156x516.png?rect=0,0,2156,515&amp;w=670&amp;h=160&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c8b47f6df2f0ff82d055817e671c239c8b5145d1-2156x516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c8b47f6df2f0ff82d055817e671c239c8b5145d1-2156x516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c8b47f6df2f0ff82d055817e671c239c8b5145d1-2156x516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c8b47f6df2f0ff82d055817e671c239c8b5145d1-2156x516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c8b47f6df2f0ff82d055817e671c239c8b5145d1-2156x516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="you-can-now-manage-your-color-space"><a href="#you-can-now-manage-your-color-space">You can now manage your color space</a></h2><p>Color accuracy is crucial for many of our users, so we shipped an update to give you more control over its appearance on the Mac desktop app (Windows coming soon).

They couldn&#39;t evaluate their designs accurately when the colors didn&#39;t match the appearance of the browsers where their product lived.</p><p>Now in our Mac app, you&#39;ll have a choice: Continue using an unmanaged profile, or switch to sRGB. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aae0f2bb2fc4db286c18c824a1567f7ccc4f6adc-1080x516.png?w=670&amp;h=320&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aae0f2bb2fc4db286c18c824a1567f7ccc4f6adc-1080x516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aae0f2bb2fc4db286c18c824a1567f7ccc4f6adc-1080x516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aae0f2bb2fc4db286c18c824a1567f7ccc4f6adc-1080x516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aae0f2bb2fc4db286c18c824a1567f7ccc4f6adc-1080x516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aae0f2bb2fc4db286c18c824a1567f7ccc4f6adc-1080x516.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1080w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="streamlined-windows-ui"><a href="#streamlined-windows-ui">Streamlined Windows UI</a></h2><p>Earlier this quarter, we gave our Windows app interface a polish.

      <title>Dribbble scores with live design collaboration for its completely remote team</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/dribbble-case-study/</link>
      <description>With Figma, Dribbble has one single source of truth for the team’s designs which creates streamlined project management and greater transparency for designers, developers and stakeholders.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What do basketball and design have in common? Why, Dribbble, of course. </p><p>We all know Dribbble and its pink basketball logo, but did you know that Dribbble has shared more than 3 trillion pixels since it was founded? The go-to resource for discovering and connecting with designers and creative talent around the globe, Dribbble helps 40,000 of the world’s best design-forward companies — Apple, Airbnb, IDEO, Facebook, Google, Dropbox, Slack, Shopify, and Lyft, to namedrop a few — get exposure for their design teams and hire talented creatives.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04220ad5f558b660454ce994720447f38f6cfea3-800x534.jpg?w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04220ad5f558b660454ce994720447f38f6cfea3-800x534.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04220ad5f558b660454ce994720447f38f6cfea3-800x534.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04220ad5f558b660454ce994720447f38f6cfea3-800x534.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04220ad5f558b660454ce994720447f38f6cfea3-800x534.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="hitting-the-court-with-remote-players"><a href="#hitting-the-court-with-remote-players">Hitting the court with remote players</a></h2><p>Because Dribbble believes that creative collaboration can happen anywhere and wants its team members to work where they feel most comfortable and inspired, the company is fully, 100 percent remote. </p><p>While the positive aspects of remote work — flexibility, better work/life balance, no commute, living and working wherever you want — help the company attract talent from everywhere, the logistics of teamwork can be more complex than walking around the office and chatting with coworkers.</p><p>For the growing design team, which includes seven product designers and developers, the biggest challenge was how to foster collaboration among designers when everyone is working remotely across multiple time zones. For Sarah Kuehnle, vice president of product at Dribbble, the goal was to make collaboration as easy as being in the same room together.  </p><div><blockquote><p>Dribbble is on a mission to build the world’s best platform for designers to gain inspiration, exposure, feedback, education, community, and job opportunities.</p></blockquote></div><p>Navigating time zones and continents, the design team relied on a slew of tools to help keep them in sync. “We used video conferencing and a mishmash of collaboration tools to support our design process and try to enable collaboration,” she says. However, none of the tools  offered a seamless way of working together. </p><p>There were other challenges as well. “We didn’t have insight into other designers’ work,” says Kuehnle. “Plus managing files and multiple streams of feedback took time away from actual design work.”     </p><h2 id="making-long-distance-collaboration-a-team-sport"><a href="#making-long-distance-collaboration-a-team-sport">Making long-distance collaboration a team sport</a></h2><p>As a remote team, Dribbble’s designers are always looking for ways to optimize their workflow. When a new member introduced Figma to the design team, their curiosity was piqued. “Figma was immediately interesting to us because we could all jump in a file at the same time,” says Kuehnle. “We realized we could recreate the experience of working together in a meeting room, on a whiteboard, brainstorming designs and sharing comments in real time.”</p><p>Not only could Figma offer a way to easily share design files, but because it is online, it’s also easy to find current files without pinging multiple people or jumping in and out of various tools. “It’s great to stay heads down, in the file and ecosystem that I am creating in instead of incurring the productivity costs of switching from app to app,” says Rogie King, senior product designer at Dribbble.</p><p>King also appreciates how Figma handles vectors and its simple approach to copy-paste attributes. “It’s amazing,” he says. “The way Figma treats images simply as a fill of an object is super brilliant.” Check out King’s <a href="https://twitter.com/rogie/status/1085570340313432064">Twitter thread</a> on designing in Figma. “I want the team to use the tools they love, but they also need to be effective for us as a design team as well as for the larger organization,” says Noah Stokes, director of design at Dribbble. “Figma has the capability to replace multiple tools in one swoop, giving us a single place to have our versioned work where anyone on the team can leave feedback and review new work. It’s pretty revolutionary, in my opinion.”</p><p>Naturally, some team members were hesitant about adopting a new tool and the effort required to get up to speed. The concerns went away once everyone realized that Figma made it easy to ingest other design file types to get started. “To ease the transition even more, we took our existing user interface and recreated it in Figma,” says Kuehnle. “That gave everyone familiar building blocks to work with.”  </p><p>💡 <strong>Share work to Dribbble directly from Figma</strong><em>Dribbble used Figma’s API to create an <a href="https://dribbble.com/stories/2018/10/15/new-plugins-and-integrations">integration</a> so you can send your work directly from Figma to Dribbble. Available today in the Figma web and desktop apps, it’s as simple as selecting a Layer and navigating to</em> <code>Integrations</code> ▸ <code>Dribbble</code><em>, where you’ll be taken to the Dribbble desktop upload flow with your artwork.</em></p><h2 id="teaming-up-to-solve-problems-faster"><a href="#teaming-up-to-solve-problems-faster">Teaming up to solve problems faster</a></h2><p>Using Figma for live, remote collaboration plays well with the Dribbble team’s strategy of using design pairs to tackle a problem or project. “We’ve found that working in design pairs helps us deliver products faster at a level of design for which we want to be known,” says Kuehnle. “Working together in a single file means design pairs can be that much more efficient.” By eliminating the friction of working between tools, team members have more time to focus on what they do best — design.</p><p>“The single source of truth helps to keep us all synced on the most recent design changes and reduces communication friction,” says King. “In larger team settings, with many iterations of a design file and many people riffing off of or adhering to a style guide, Figma flexes hard.” </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7308f0d0f129c1bebc3adeb9e59195952d74f94e-3302x2620.png?rect=1,0,3300,2620&amp;w=670&amp;h=532&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7308f0d0f129c1bebc3adeb9e59195952d74f94e-3302x2620.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7308f0d0f129c1bebc3adeb9e59195952d74f94e-3302x2620.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7308f0d0f129c1bebc3adeb9e59195952d74f94e-3302x2620.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7308f0d0f129c1bebc3adeb9e59195952d74f94e-3302x2620.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7308f0d0f129c1bebc3adeb9e59195952d74f94e-3302x2620.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Dribbble is also using Figma to hold more frequent design critiques and tighten feedback loops. Multiplayer allows all the designers to jump into a single design file to share work. And because they are all working from the same file, the remote team can easily duplicate frames to brainstorm new ideas, make comments or implement changes all in real time.   </p><p>This means that Dribbble designers can iterate on designs faster, solving problems in minutes compared to days. Kuehnle cites a recent example: “We wanted to add something new to a user profile and I already had a frame in Figma that I presented to the team on a video call,” says Kuehnle. “Five of us all jumped on the file, brainstormed solutions, critiqued each other’s ideas, and within 20 minutes we had a design that we all liked. This is exactly how it should work.”</p><h2 id="making-design-transparent-and-collaborative-for"><a href="#making-design-transparent-and-collaborative-for">Making design transparent and collaborative for everyone</a></h2><p>For the first time, Dribbble has one single source of truth for the team’s designs, which streamlines project management and creates greater transparency for designers, developers and stakeholders. “With Figma, there’s one place for feedback instead of managing different feedback threads separately,” says Kuehnle. “In addition to helping us solve design challenges faster, it helps us save project management time as well.” </p><p>For King, Figma’s multiplayer mode helps him educate other designers on his workflow. By clicking on his avatar in Figma, designers can follow along as he designs and learn new things by watching what he does. Sometimes, he puts a Figma link into a Slack channel and invites people to his file, giving them a way to learn through osmosis — a method not otherwise possible for a remote team. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?rect=1,0,3300,2620&amp;w=670&amp;h=532&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5ad27ee82e7b788fd37ebbd6c870cecf3b40da9b-3302x2620.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Even the designers that use the Dribbble platform are collaborating and providing suggestions and feedback via Figma to the Dribbble team. “We redesigned the shot page a few months ago and immediately got intense feedback on it,” says Kuehnle. “Our users really care about Dribbble and several invested their own time in creating a Figma file with our new design and iterating on it. We got some great suggestions and actionable feedback from that effort.”</p><p>While Dribbble is tool-agnostic and prides itself on working with all design tools, the design team still turns to Figma to come together and collaborate across multiple time zones as if they were in the same room. “Figma allows true collaboration with not only fellow designers, but with all stakeholders,” says Stokes. “When everyone from our c-level folks down knows where to find design work to review, then we’re winning.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The power of Figma Drafts</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/the-power-of-figma-drafts/</link>
      <description>Learn how an unassuming icon in the File Browser called “drafts” helped me embrace the collaborative, open design platform that Figma is built around.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When I first started using Figma with a team, I was unnerved by the fact that anyone could jump in my files and see my work in progress. Historically, I was taught to share designs when they’re done (or nearly there). Whether it&#39;s a deliverable for a client, or something I want to get feedback on from a colleague, I would only pass it on when it was practically flawless.</p><p>There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with this (who doesn&#39;t want to share their best work?), but if I&#39;m being honest with myself this tendency was driven in large part by fear.</p><p>I worried that I’d be judged by the neatness of the file, the pixel-perfection of the shapes, or the naming convention of the layer names, instead of the actual solution I presented. This fear was amplified in an open, collaborative environment.</p><p>What if they see I&#39;m not using an 8px grid?What if they notice I haven&#39;t named my layers?What if they see how I create my icons?What if...?</p><p>In Figma, I would focus my energy and time on making sure the file was &#34;presentable&#34; rather than exploring solutions. If that sounds familiar to you, you’re not alone. Open design is still relatively new, so we&#39;re all still figuring out the processes and techniques that work.</p><p>Over time I adapted, in large part by relying on one Figma feature: An unassuming icon in the File Browser called “<a href="https://help.figma.com/article/19-file-browser">drafts</a>.” Drafts gave me a way to dip my toe in the pool of open design before jumping off the diving board. A lot of people don&#39;t know much about our drafts feature or how to use it, so I thought I&#39;d share a little more about my approach in the hopes that it helps others. </p><h2 id="the-what-and-why-of-figma-drafts"><a href="#the-what-and-why-of-figma-drafts">The what and why of Figma Drafts</a></h2><p>You may have noticed the “drafts” icon before, or even used it from time to time. We have very little documentation on it from a support perspective, and we rarely mention it in product launches, because truth be told, from a technical perspective, it&#39;s the same as other organizational structures in Figma. Like teams and projects, it’s a place to hold files.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?rect=0,0,2559,1440&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9dd84883e2bd1378543d3352a15be08134501d2f-2560x1440.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>But there’s one key difference — it’s your personal folder. Your drafts aren’t beholden to the <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/20-permissions">permissions/share settings</a> of the larger team or project you’re operating in (the way you are in the rest of Figma). In fact, you can’t grant global access to your drafts to anyone else — you can only choose to share an individual file (or not). It’s inherently your own space, to do with what you will.</p><p>Aside from just making you more comfortable with open design, drafts can also help you move past your dreaded designer’s block. You may be full of caffeine, inspired, and want to put pen to paper...but where do you start? Do you first try and find colors or maybe typography? What about flow and organization?</p><p>None of that matters in “drafts,” which are — by their very definition — not the polished final product. They’re a place for experimentation.</p><p>There’s a lot of power in language, and for me, the word “drafts” evokes a carefree psychological association. When I hear it, I don&#39;t think of design systems, prototypes, colors, or grids. No, instead I imagine my notebook that sits next to my computer at my desk, packed with random ideas, sketches, and a few partially completed to-do lists. Some of the pages are full from top to bottom, while others have a single word or a little icon drawn on them. Some are neatly written in pen, while others are smeared with pencil markings and the faint remains of poorly erased ideas.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670&amp;h=502&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e31e5a02cb0b88d45dfb870c1b8417758318530c-3852x2886.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A look into my notebook.</figcaption></figure><p>Early on in my time at Figma, drafts became my digital notebook, my space to test things out.

You&#39;ll notice that most of my draft files are untitled and contain random shapes in that beautiful default grey. 😉 Over time, I&#39;ve learned to embrace this mess for the sake of working through my ideas.</p><p>This is the key to making the most of your drafts space: <strong>Create first, organize second!</strong></p><p>There will come a time that you&#39;ll want to move your drafts into a project for further organization or to share with the rest of your team. Figuring out when to do this is completely up to you and will probably vary depending on what the actual draft is. For example, if it was a wireframe that I wanted to start creating high fidelity screens from,  it would make sense to move the entire file into a project. </p><p>To achieve this all you need to do is select the file you want to move then drag it into the desired project.</p><figure><figcaption>Drag and drop a draft file into a team project.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also do this inside the file by clicking on “Drafts” just left of the name and then selecting the project you’d like to move it to.</p><figure><figcaption>Move a draft file into a team project via the dropdown.</figcaption></figure><p>If the draft contains an idea that I want to iterate on (maybe across different pages and files), I&#39;ll actually duplicate the draft first and then move the file into a project via the steps above. This allows me to keep a snapshot of that idea in my drafts in case I ever want to go back to it.</p><p>In this transfer/organization process I try to keep my drafts as the messy source of truth, and then clean up the elements in the actual project files. </p><p>The last method I use to organize my drafts (or any space in the file browser) is the filter feature. Near the top right of the screen you&#39;ll find the dropdown to filter by File Name, Date Created, or Last Modified. Using these filters are a great way to help you find that one idea you had at the product milestone meeting on Thursday…or back during January&#39;s OKR brainstorm…or in 2017 😬. Everything that&#39;s old becomes new again right?</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/05ce22a604a33e853be0b301abf38daf26af62ce-2560x1440.jpg?rect=0,0,2559,1440&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/05ce22a604a33e853be0b301abf38daf26af62ce-2560x1440.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/05ce22a604a33e853be0b301abf38daf26af62ce-2560x1440.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/05ce22a604a33e853be0b301abf38daf26af62ce-2560x1440.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/05ce22a604a33e853be0b301abf38daf26af62ce-2560x1440.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/05ce22a604a33e853be0b301abf38daf26af62ce-2560x1440.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Filter your files by name, date created, or when they were last modified.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="final-thoughts"><a href="#final-thoughts">Final thoughts</a></h2><p>Overall, using drafts has encouraged me embrace Figma&#39;s open, collaborative environment. It warmed me up to the idea of bringing people into my design process early and often, without being so focused on the appearance of the file. And it helped me to roll up my sleeves, push back against creative block, and just start designing. </p><p>Do you use drafts? What&#39;s your approach to this personal space?

      <title>When to use groups versus frames in Figma</title>

      <description>Want to know when to use a group or a frame when designing in Figma? This guide will walk you through all of the unique features and use cases for both and help you determine when to use one over the other.</description>

They are both containers for housing objects, but they have their own unique properties and use cases. It&#39;s not always obvious how they differ from each other, so to help distinguish between them I wrote up this primer.</p><h2 id="groups"><a href="#groups">Groups</a></h2><p>Similar to other design tools, groups in Figma allow you to combine multiple elements together as a single top level layer. A group&#39;s bounds are determined by its child elements, so resizing or moving those elements will cause the group&#39;s bounds to adjust automatically. You can create a group by selecting objects and pressing: <code>⌘ + G</code> (Mac) or <code>Ctrl + G</code> (Win).</p><figure><figcaption>A groups bounds automatically adjust as child elements are resized or repositioned.</figcaption></figure><p>Making a group is non destructive—meaning it won&#39;t flatten or permanently combine the layers together. At any point you can ungroup the elements, by pressing: <code>⌘ + Shift + G</code> (Mac) or <code>Ctrl + Shift G</code> (Win).</p><p>Groups are really useful when you want to combine similar items together and manage less layers within your design. For example, you may have a selection of company logos that need to stay together. Grouping them is a great way to combine them into one single more manageable layer—clicking on any of the elements within your group will select the entire thing and allow you to move or manipulate it as a single object on the canvas. If you need to select a particular child element within a group, you can do so by double clicking.</p><p>You can also leverage features like <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-smart-selection/">Smart Selections</a> inside a group to adjust the spacing between elements. In the example below you can see the group&#39;s bounds auto adjust to match the overall dimensions of the child elements when the spacing changes.</p><p>When you resize a group, its child elements will scale as you would expect vector artwork to scale. However effects, strokes, and type sizes will not scale. If you wish to scale these properties too, use the <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/35-scale-tool">scale tool</a> (<code>K</code>). If you want to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/five-essential-ways-to-use-design-constraints/">apply constraints</a> to define how elements will be resized, consider using a frame instead. Constraints applied to elements will always be relative to the closest parent frame—not relative to the bounds of the group. More on that as we uncover frames!</p><figure><figcaption>A comparison of scaling groups containing vector artwork and text using normal resize behavior and resizing with the scale tool (K).</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Design on a deadline: How Notion pulled itself back from the brink of failure</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/design-on-a-deadline-how-notion-pulled-itself-back-from-the-brink-of-failure/</link>
      <description>The story of its last-minute pivot and epic comeback.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In 2015, <a href="https://www.notion.so">productivity tool Notion</a> nearly died. Its founders, <a href="https://twitter.com/ivanhzhao">Ivan Zhao</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/simonlast">Simon Last</a>, had built their app on a suboptimal tech stack, and it crashed constantly. Their angel investment money dwindling, they faced a brutal choice: Fire their fledgling team of 4 and start over, or run out of cash. “If you looked at the burn rate, we all would’ve died together,” Ivan says. “It wasn’t much of a choice.”</p><p>So they sublet their San Francisco office and moved to a cheaper city where they could focus: Kyoto. “Neither of us spoke Japanese and nobody there spoke English, so all we did was code in our underwear all day,” Ivan says. </p><p>It was around that time we noticed Ivan <a href="https://www.figma.com">in Figma</a>. He suddenly popped to the top of our most active user list — spending upwards of 18+ hours a day in our design tool. As we’d later find out, he was designing frenetically and barely sleeping, pumping out version after version of a new app that would become Notion 1.0.</p><p>He and Simon set out to rebuild Notion from scratch, keeping the same mission: Give non-techies the ability to make their own tools without writing code. They wanted people to customize technology to solve their own problems.</p><div><blockquote><p>Design means everything here. We’re a tool that solves people’s daily problems.</p></blockquote></div><p>It was an ambitious goal, and they needed to nail the user experience. During their year of reckoning, they developed a unique design process to help them do that — from tag-teaming design challenges, to brainstorming endless permutations of a user flow. These tactics played a crucial role in turning the company around and became the secret sauce of their product when they relaunched. (Check out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18251787/notion-evernote-web-clipper-import-tool">today’s news in The Verge</a> about Notion <a href="https://www.notion.so/evernote">taking on Evernote</a>.)</p><p>We sat down with Ivan to get the full back story on the company’s pivot (which they&#39;ve never talked about publicly before), and the role design played in saving the product. </p><h2 id="fighting-for-notion-s-life-teamwork-makes-the"><a href="#fighting-for-notion-s-life-teamwork-makes-the">Fighting for Notion’s life: Teamwork makes the dreamwork</a></h2><p>There’s a lot of ways to build a customizable software tool. In the first go-round — Notion beta — Ivan and Simon made a programming application that was easy to use even if someone didn’t know how to code. It turned out, people weren’t interested in that. </p><p>“We focused too much on what we wanted to bring to the world,” Ivan put it. “We needed to pay attention to what the world wanted from us.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c876c1fbaec8531db6bb0baa3ca5e589ec081c5f-2024x1662.png?rect=0,0,2024,1661&amp;w=670&amp;h=550&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c876c1fbaec8531db6bb0baa3ca5e589ec081c5f-2024x1662.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c876c1fbaec8531db6bb0baa3ca5e589ec081c5f-2024x1662.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c876c1fbaec8531db6bb0baa3ca5e589ec081c5f-2024x1662.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c876c1fbaec8531db6bb0baa3ca5e589ec081c5f-2024x1662.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c876c1fbaec8531db6bb0baa3ca5e589ec081c5f-2024x1662.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Notion’s user onboarding is warm and approachable.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might imagine, pulling off this big of an about-face with their product required fresh design thinking. In their crunch year, Ivan and Simon worked collaboratively so they could move faster together. With Figma’s multiplayer feature, they’d jump into files at the same time and brainstorm. They’d riff off each other’s ideas or tag team different parts of the work.</p><p>“He’s programming, I’m designing. I could be programming, he’s designing. We were able to explore the maze together,” Ivan says. “The real-time thing with Figma is key — you can’t do that in many other products.”</p><p>In March of 2018, after months of sleepless nights, Notion 1.0 was ready for primetime. In short stead, it <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/notion-1-0-web-mac-app">skyrocketed</a> to the top of Product Hunt, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-only-app-you-need-for-work-life-productivity-1521640800">got a glowing review</a> in the print version of the Wall Street Journal, and became famous for something else — <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/notion-has-vc-knocking-on-its-doors-to-invest-2019-2">ignoring the door</a> when VCs came knocking.</p><div><blockquote><p>Notion hit 1 million users with only a seed round of funding.</p></blockquote></div><p>It also <a href="https://www.designernews.co/stories/73315-ama-ivan-zhao-cofounderdesigner-of-notion">garnered</a> accolades for its user experience, with <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/notion-2-0">some calling it</a>, “a milestone in the history of UX design.” Despite the app’s powerful functionality, the new user home screen is minimal. It features a small collection of icons that harken back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Kare">Susan Kare</a> (the mother of Mac iconography). Ivan calls it very “Windows 95.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd6c11f3d7aef5fa99143c79ca97b97e51aad6ae-1938x1570.png?rect=0,0,1937,1570&amp;w=670&amp;h=543&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd6c11f3d7aef5fa99143c79ca97b97e51aad6ae-1938x1570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd6c11f3d7aef5fa99143c79ca97b97e51aad6ae-1938x1570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd6c11f3d7aef5fa99143c79ca97b97e51aad6ae-1938x1570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd6c11f3d7aef5fa99143c79ca97b97e51aad6ae-1938x1570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd6c11f3d7aef5fa99143c79ca97b97e51aad6ae-1938x1570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Notion’s home screen for new users is simple.</figcaption></figure><p>“Design means everything here,” Ivan says. “We’re a tool that solves people’s daily problems. Just like how they care about how the hammer feels or the knife cuts, how Notion feels has substantial value to them.”</p><p>Here are some of the tactics instrumental to Notion’s design process.</p><h2 id="create-many-variations-then-choose-one"><a href="#create-many-variations-then-choose-one">Create many variations, then choose one</a></h2><p>In their year of crisis, Ivan would replicate a flow again and again, tweaking only small details here and there — swapping out an icon, adding a different line of text. </p><p>“Our general philosophy is to go crazy with permutations,” he says. “If the taste is there, which you can grow by studying typography and the giants of industry, you can churn out versions until you find the best one.”</p><p>To this day, Notion employs this method of endless iteration to make decisions. Designers create multiple versions of any deliverable, as do copywriters, engineers, and even the in-house illustrator. The key is to stay loose, hash out a bunch of rough drafts, embrace big ideas (even bad ones), and free as many concepts from one’s brain as possible. Then turn to your teammates and let them stress test. You’ll inevitably narrow the field to the best option. Ivan says this practice is the reason Notion’s brand is so distinct.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f86b8cbc5b6f2a3bb52a045d3e46807c9dd45f6-3751x2151.png?rect=0,0,3751,2150&amp;w=670&amp;h=384&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f86b8cbc5b6f2a3bb52a045d3e46807c9dd45f6-3751x2151.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f86b8cbc5b6f2a3bb52a045d3e46807c9dd45f6-3751x2151.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f86b8cbc5b6f2a3bb52a045d3e46807c9dd45f6-3751x2151.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f86b8cbc5b6f2a3bb52a045d3e46807c9dd45f6-3751x2151.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5f86b8cbc5b6f2a3bb52a045d3e46807c9dd45f6-3751x2151.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Illustrations of the 13-person Notion team</figcaption></figure><p>Notion prioritizes a culture of design by doing all their thinking visually. They develop ideas in Figma from the get-go, using it almost like a scratchpad. And that method applies to everyone at the tiny 13-person company, not just designers.</p><p>“With Figma, it’s easy enough for anyone to get a vision out of their head and onto the page for others to see,” says Ivan. “It’s truly a tool for thought, just like Notion. So we feel like kindred spirits in that way.”</p><p>If you visit Notion’s office (a skylit converted garage in the deep Mission), you’ll see people playing with designs in Figma to build arguments. They’ll lay out pages, drag and drop elements, and whip up mocks in response to product debates or community support tickets. They’ll append notes with Figma URLs and the line: “Would something like this do the trick?”</p><h2 id="build-institutional-knowledge-as-you-go"><a href="#build-institutional-knowledge-as-you-go">Build institutional knowledge as you go</a></h2><p>Given Notion’s early history, Ivan and Simon have special appreciation for institutional memory — what has been tried before, what worked and what didn’t. As far as they’re concerned, nothing should ever be deleted.</p><p>“I am constantly like, ‘Do not replace that text! Just copy and create a new canvas!’” says Ivan. “In Figma, you open any file of ours and there’s seven or eight canvases all side by side. You see how the words and design evolved between one and the next.” </p><p>With that kind of record, people can learn from the mistakes of those who came before them. Notion’s Figma workspace is divided into a granular folder tree structure that makes it simple to navigate to any past project.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fc373d16b226d75baaf3cf30bad1963c5957405b-2700x1750.png?rect=0,0,2700,1749&amp;w=670&amp;h=434&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fc373d16b226d75baaf3cf30bad1963c5957405b-2700x1750.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fc373d16b226d75baaf3cf30bad1963c5957405b-2700x1750.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fc373d16b226d75baaf3cf30bad1963c5957405b-2700x1750.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fc373d16b226d75baaf3cf30bad1963c5957405b-2700x1750.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fc373d16b226d75baaf3cf30bad1963c5957405b-2700x1750.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Notion’s Figma project structure is organized so people can easily find previous design explorations.</figcaption></figure><p>Fittingly, new Notion hires are expected to review the permutations Ivan and Simon explored during their 2015 rebuild of the tool. “They need to see how we came up with the way we think about things,” Ivan says. “And a lot of this lives in the designs we made.”</p><h2 id="the-falling-dominoes"><a href="#the-falling-dominoes">The falling dominoes</a></h2><p>These are just a few of the reasons Notion’s rise continues uncontested, despite their small team and meager funding.

They hit 1 million users without it.</p><p>The tool is infiltrating tech companies from the ground-up, much like Slack and Dropbox did. At Figma, we first saw our customer service team quietly sneak off Google Docs and switch to Notion. HR came next, followed by Marketing. Like dominoes stacked to fall, once one team shared the gospel and showed what was possible, others couldn’t help but get curious. </p><p>Are you next?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They let you reuse UI objects and attributes so you can maintain designs systematically at scale. When you need to change something, like your brand’s link color or home icon, you can make the change once — in the original main component or style — and watch it update across all your designs.</p><p>You can use components and styles:</p><ol><li>Within one individual file in Figma&#39;s <a href="https://www.figma.com/pricing/">free tier</a></li><li>Across different files and projects in the <a href="https://www.figma.com/pricing/">Figma Professional tier</a></li><li>Across teams in the <a href="https://www.figma.com/organization/">Figma Organization</a> tier</li></ol><p>There’s an endless number of things to consider when creating, naming and managing your components and styles, so we put together a best practice guide to help you out. Grab a cup of coffee and get settled for the 101 masterclass.</p><p>A quick note: Before making components in Figma, we recommend figuring out which Figma plan makes the most sense for you. If you&#39;re signed up for Figma Organization, read this best practice article on <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/getting-started-with-teams-in-figma-organization/">setting up your teams in Figma</a>, because that structure will form the foundation of your component organization.</p><h2 id="what-are-components-and-styles"><a href="#what-are-components-and-styles">What are components and styles?</a></h2><p>If you already know all the basics of components, styles and libraries, jump to to the next section.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/28443957d991aa876520c1e8be4a98c7734d4365-3392x1302.png?w=693&amp;h=266&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/28443957d991aa876520c1e8be4a98c7734d4365-3392x1302.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 347w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/28443957d991aa876520c1e8be4a98c7734d4365-3392x1302.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 520w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/28443957d991aa876520c1e8be4a98c7734d4365-3392x1302.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 693w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/28443957d991aa876520c1e8be4a98c7734d4365-3392x1302.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1040w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/28443957d991aa876520c1e8be4a98c7734d4365-3392x1302.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1386w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The process of creating, publishing, and sharing components and styles </figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://help.figma.com/article/66-components">Components</a>: These are reusable objects in your design. They can be as simple as an individual button, or as complex as an entire navigation header (comprised of instances of other components like logos, avatars, buttons and menu items). You&#39;ll discover that components work similarly to &#34;symbols&#34; in Sketch or other design tools, but with a few unique differences. More on that in a bit.</p><p>Here is a list of common things people turn into components:</p><ul><li>UI components</li><li>Company logos and brand assets</li><li>Icons</li><li>Device mockups</li><li>Platform OS components (Android, iOS, Linux, OSX, etc)</li><li>Cursors</li><li>Redlining and annotation components</li><li>Post-it notes and voting &#34;stickers&#34; for running collaborative design sprints</li><li>Diagramming &#34;helpers&#34; like flow arrows and flowchart shapes</li></ul><p><strong><a href="https://help.figma.com/article/66-components#instance">Component Instances</a>:</strong> Once you make something a component, you can create instances of it, which are essentially connected copies of that component—so if you update the design of the original component, the instances will reflect that change. For example, if you change the color of a button component to red, and then publish those changes, any file that used instances of that button will get a notification. They can then choose whether to update their instances to red.</p><p><strong><a href="https://help.figma.com/article/186-styles-creating-styles">Styles</a>:</strong> These are reusable collections of properties which you can easily apply to elements in your design. In Figma, you can create styles for text, colors, grids and effects like shadows and blurs. If components are reusable objects, think of styles as the attributes you might apply to those objects.</p><p><strong><a href="https://help.figma.com/article/29-team-library">Libraries</a>:</strong> In Figma, you can share components and styles by publishing them. This turns your file into a library, so you can use instances of those components in other files. Updates to the design of your components can be published and pushed out to other documents where instances of your components live. Users have the choice to accept those updates or continue working with an old version (if required).</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/023869c684ef81e8a34cfdbd623ad2bfa1c54193-2156x1186.png?rect=0,0,2156,1185&amp;w=693&amp;h=381&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/023869c684ef81e8a34cfdbd623ad2bfa1c54193-2156x1186.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 347w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/023869c684ef81e8a34cfdbd623ad2bfa1c54193-2156x1186.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 520w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/023869c684ef81e8a34cfdbd623ad2bfa1c54193-2156x1186.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 693w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/023869c684ef81e8a34cfdbd623ad2bfa1c54193-2156x1186.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1040w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/023869c684ef81e8a34cfdbd623ad2bfa1c54193-2156x1186.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1386w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>You can create libraries for anything you need to repeatedly use.</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Bulb shines bright with Solar as its design system</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/bulb-case-study/</link>
      <description>Bulb adopts Figma to build, maintain and host their design system Solar.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Making energy simpler, cheaper, and greener is the mission of <a href="https://bulb.co.uk/">Bulb</a>, the largest green energy supplier in the UK. To help people save on their energy bills and lower their carbon emissions while protecting the planet, Bulb supplies 100 percent green electricity and 10 percent green gas, sourced from renewable generators from across the UK. </p><p>As part of its vision to make the entire energy industry better, Bulb is a certified B-Corp, working to demonstrate that businesses can be a force for good. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/oliversmith/2018/03/05/bulb-the-bright-startup-thats-shaking-up-britains-54bn-energy-market/#6cc2f961c04f">Forbes</a> calls it “the bright startup that’s shaking up the market.” And shaking it up it is, with the company experiencing 2,000 percent growth in the past 18 months.</p><h2 id="powering-up-the-design-function"><a href="#powering-up-the-design-function">Powering up the design function</a></h2><p>Supporting this rising energy star is the 13-strong design team that works across a handful of different product groups and teams - including include engineers, product managers, researchers and content writers.  </p><p>Alla Kholmatova is head of design and user experience at Bulb (may recognize her name from her book, <a href="https://designsystemsbook.com/">Design Systems</a>). “When I started at Bulb, each of our five or six products had been built and designed by different agencies,” she says. “Even though the visual brand was distinct and cohesive, there were many inconsistencies, with each product having a different code base and different design patterns.” </p><p>The upside of literally starting the design team from scratch is that Bulb represented a clean slate in terms of defining a design system and choosing a tool to support the design workflow.     </p><div><blockquote><p>There are a lot of moving parts here at Bulb, and it’s the responsibility of the design and UX team to make sure that all the products, websites and services that we design feel cohesive and consistent, and are designed to the highest possible standard.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="shining-a-light-on-collaboration"><a href="#shining-a-light-on-collaboration">Shining a light on collaboration</a></h2><p>One of the things Alla immediately noticed when she joined Bulb was the culture of collaboration and transparency across all business groups. Eager to carry that same culture into the design team, she needed to implement a design tool that would fit well within this open style of working. </p><p>“After observing the teams, how they work, and the challenges that Bulb design faces, Figma felt like the right tool for what we needed to accomplish and for our workflow,” she says. </p><p>Today the team operates using a pod structure, meaning each project pod will have a designer, researcher, content writer, and developer. Fifi Kara, product designer at Bulb, explains,“with Figma, everyone can access and use it to do what they need to do without needing permission from a designer.” Content writers, developers and stakeholders can can easily jump into Figma and make suggestions or get an update. “It’s empowering,” says Fifi. </p><p>Luke John, design system engineering lead at Bulb, agrees. “The design process at Bulb is very collaborative, so it’s important for us that our engineers and designers can work together throughout the process,” he says. “Having a tool like Figma enables conversations around designs and helps us make sure we’re meeting guidelines and standards.” </p><p>Part of the appeal of Figma for the Bulb team is that it’s easy for non-designers to collaborate using the tool as well. Beth Horne, senior user researcher at Bulb, conducts discovery research to identify problems or user needs and opportunities. She works with a designer collaboratively using Figma to brainstorm ideas, sketch ideas, and prototype solutions. “Working with designers collaboratively using Figma is easy and helpful because it’s not like a scary design tool where there are loads of things I don’t understand,” she says.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31b0722672c9f8af8889d58851b07a5e62e15702-677x902.png?w=670&amp;h=893&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31b0722672c9f8af8889d58851b07a5e62e15702-677x902.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31b0722672c9f8af8889d58851b07a5e62e15702-677x902.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31b0722672c9f8af8889d58851b07a5e62e15702-677x902.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31b0722672c9f8af8889d58851b07a5e62e15702-677x902.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 677w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Image from Bulb website: https://bulb.co.uk/service </figcaption></figure><h2 id="bringing-collaborative-energy-to-creating-a"><a href="#bringing-collaborative-energy-to-creating-a">Bringing collaborative energy to creating a design system</a></h2><p>With the right tool in place, the team turned its attention to creating a design system for Bulb. “I wanted to establish a design system to achieve consistency by creating this one source of truth for design,” says Alla. “Figma’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgRUEyw9xpo">team library</a> is very suited to working with a design system because if we change a master component, it will update across all of the designs.” The synchronization of styles and components across files - all accessed within the browser - provides this fast-paced team the perfect palette for the design system. </p><p>Starting with a screenshot of every page of each Bulb product, the team created a visual site map in Figma, which highlighted the breadth of inconsistencies and deviations across the different products. Forming a collaborative team for the project, the members began establishing <a href="https://medium.com/making-bulb/the-principles-behind-bulbs-design-8da5b07b5a06">design principles</a> that were then used to guide the team when it started normalizing the components and systemizing design patterns. </p><p>“Because there were, for example, many different versions of things like buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, etc., defining design principles allowed us to say, ‘Okay, so this one is simple and robust and this one isn’t,’ and gradually we created patterns and rolled them out across eight different products,” says Alla.</p><div><blockquote><p>My advice for other companies that want to build a design system is to keep it very, very simple and start small. In Bulb’s design system, we have a very simple and small color palette and a small number of design patterns. We work hard to keep it as small and simple as possible because the more complex the design system becomes, the harder it is to manage.</p></blockquote></div><p>Working collaboratively meant that multiple disciplines were involved in creating the design system. “It was absolutely fantastic because the developers were part of building the design system,” says Fifi. “And that makes it more likely for them to use because they helped build it.” </p><h2 id="turning-on-solar-power"><a href="#turning-on-solar-power">Turning on “Solar” power</a></h2><p>The Bulb team named its design system <a href="https://design.bulb.co.uk/#/patterns/styles/colors/README.md">Solar</a> and it’s a collection of shared patterns and practices that allow the team to build interfaces consistently and quickly. Patterns are the repeating, reusable parts of the interface, such as buttons, colors, typography and icons. Practices are how designers create, organize and share those patterns.<br/>“Design practices are a cultural element of design systems,” says Alla. “They define how we work together, define new patterns, name them, decide whether a pattern is good enough to be part of the system, contribute new patterns to the design system, review them, and so on.” </p><p>Most of the design patterns in Solar are supported by user research. “We try to ground them in real context, with research insights kept alongside design patterns,” says Alla. “With Figma, it’s very easy for user researchers to add insights directly into design mock-ups so everyone can view the rationale that went into each project. No research insights are lost in the process.”  </p><p>The hallmark of Bulb’s design system is that it is purpose-built for collaboration. Everyone on the team has a space to contribute, and it’s not only for developers or designers. The systems  has a built-in process for submitting new patterns. Using a template form in Figma, users can input the suggested pattern details, any user research, design specifications, and so on. The submission then goes to the design architecture team, which  reviews it and ultimately decides if the pattern will be submitted to the system. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?rect=0,0,1920,1275&amp;w=670&amp;h=445&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f370c371b8e0020f10642ddce7e941a8cd992ab-1920x1276.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Image from Bulb&#39;s Design Blog: https://bulb.co.uk/blog/introducing-bulbs-design-system  </figcaption></figure><h2 id="accelerating-the-speed-of-design"><a href="#accelerating-the-speed-of-design">Accelerating the speed of design</a></h2><p>With the Solar design system as the only source of truth for all design, designers and developers can work at a rapid pace. “We run a really fast design process here,” says Beth. “We’re constantly building things, testing them, iterating, and improving. Being able to pull together a prototype in Figma really quickly and easily is a massive bonus for me as a user researcher.”</p><p>With its Figma-powered workflow, Bulb doesn’t have to worry about losing time and momentum during hand-offs. “We don’t have these points in the design process where we hand off,” says Beth. “I’m not doing usability testing, then writing a report and handing it to a designer to pick up. We can continue to collaborate throughout the entire process, which means that user research is visible at every stage of the design effort.” </p><p>As Bulb continues to grow and the design team along with it, having a design system and collaborative tool in place helps the company maintain its collaborative and transparent culture. “Coming into Bulb, where we had Figma and such a transparent design process, has been amazing,” says Luke John. “Figma is just incredible for how we communicate about design at Bulb.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/167351e7b0f5bf9d83f92dd234d5f1e29584dcae-924x626.png?w=670&amp;h=454&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/167351e7b0f5bf9d83f92dd234d5f1e29584dcae-924x626.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/167351e7b0f5bf9d83f92dd234d5f1e29584dcae-924x626.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/167351e7b0f5bf9d83f92dd234d5f1e29584dcae-924x626.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/167351e7b0f5bf9d83f92dd234d5f1e29584dcae-924x626.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 924w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Image from the Bulb design system site: http://design.bulb.co.uk </figcaption></figure><div><blockquote><p>I love live sharing in Figma.

      <title>Figma raises $40MM Series C round led by Sequoia</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-series-c/</link>
      <description>Figma announces a $40 million Series C funding round led by Sequoia</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Figma our mission is to make design accessible. We think everyone should have the tools to express themselves visually, and the design process should be open and collaborative. Our latest round of funding, a $40MM Series C announced today, will help us make that happen.</p><p>We wanted to take a moment to talk about what our fundraising represents and where Figma is headed next. </p><h2 id="first-the-lowdown"><a href="#first-the-lowdown">First, the lowdown</a></h2><p>The lead investor for Figma&#39;s Series C is Sequoia Capital. Coatue, Founders Fund, Jeff Weiner (CEO of LinkedIn), Mike Krieger (Co-founder Instagram), Andrew Wilson (CEO of EA) and Dan Rose (VP Partnerships at Facebook) also participated in the round along with our existing venture partners Index, Greylock and KPCB. Our goal was to bring on investors with experience building enduring companies and communities. We were impressed with Sequoia’s track record backing companies like Github and PlanGrid and as we spent more time with them it was clear they could help us bring Figma to a new level.</p><p>All productivity tools are becoming shared, collaborative spaces and design is no different. We’re excited to see best in class design teams at companies like <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-organization/#square-video">Square</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-organization/#uber-video">Uber</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bhaggs/status/1050446991640035328">Twitter</a> and GitHub switch entirely to Figma. Our Series C round will enable us to invest in our <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-organization/">Organization offering</a> as well as make improvements in the experience for individual designers / small teams.</p><h2 id="the-future"><a href="#the-future">The future</a></h2><p>At Figma, performance and quality are always top of mind. While we often hear that Figma is faster than our native competitors, we still believe there are a ton of improvements to make on both loading and rendering performance. With over a million signups, we believe it’s essential to offer all of our users the highest quality experience possible — even as the surface area of what we’re tackling expands. The team is especially focused on making Figma the best place to build and manage a design system.</p><p>We&#39;re also hard at work on platform and extensibility. For your design process to be truly open, you need a way to extend Figma for all sorts of different use cases. (No ETA yet — we want extensions to be stable and secure so we’re taking our time.)</p><p>Lastly, stay tuned for our developments around community. We have a huge global footprint already, with 80% of our weekly active users coming from outside the United States (and 26 user groups in cities spanning Lagos to Toronto), and we want to figure out better ways to connect all these different people coming from different places. (Interested in participating in the Figma community? <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/">Check out the meetups</a> we’re hosting to see whether there’s one happening nearby or reach out to us to create a new user group in your city!)</p><p>As we’ve mentioned before, we see community as the foundation of Figma’s future, which is part of the reason Sequoia appealed to us so much as a firm. They deeply understand what it means to build a community-driven business, which will be the next big chapter of Figma’s story. </p><p>Thank you for joining us on this journey. We deeply appreciate your support, and we don’t take it for granted.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Introducing Figma Organization: Our first enterprise-grade offering</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-organization/</link>
      <description>Figma Organization enables large teams to design at scale.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we first started Figma, we weren’t sure where this journey would take us. We’d placed our bets on a (then) controversial belief that design belonged on the web, like most other industries. There were a lot of naysayers, and our earliest customers were smaller, innovative startups that could take a chance on new technology.</p><p>Five years later, a lot has changed. Organizations of all types and sizes are moving towards an open design process. They’ve seen the benefits that come from web-based design, and they don’t want to return to a world of sequestered design teams and files languishing on hard-drives. As our footprint has expanded across industries, we’ve developed our product to handle a broader scope of needs (like prototyping and code handoff). </p><p>With <a href="https://www.figma.com/organization/">Figma Organization</a>, launching today, we’re unveiling our first enterprise-grade offering, with sophisticated controls and security features. To build it, we partnered with businesses of all types — from retail (Rakuten) to financial (Square) to automotive (Volvo) to tech (Uber). Based on their feedback, we built a new, more powerful version of Figma with everything corporate leadership might need (unified billing, audit reports and more), and a few extra features designers will love (Shared Fonts, unlimited teams and organization wide design systems). You can read <a href="https://www.figma.com/organization/">the full feature list here</a>.</p><p>Read on for a deep dive on some of this new functionality, brought to life with anecdotes from our Beta partners. We hope they’ll provide workflow inspiration on what’s possible when your tool is on the web.</p><h2 id="unlimited-browsable-teams"><a href="#unlimited-browsable-teams">Unlimited, browsable teams</a></h2><p>With Figma Organization, companies can build an integrated home for all their design activity. There’s no cap on the number of teams users can create or join, making it easy for everyone to view prototypes, export assets, copy code or just peek into what other teams are working on. Since Figma runs on the web, everything stays up to date. </p><p>As Uber designer Femke van Schoonhoven put it: &#34;Figma is like a tidy bookshelf, where you can find exactly what you need, whenever you need it.&#34;</p><p>That bird’s eye view is crucial for big organizations. For example, Volvo Cars has been around for 100 years and has to manage the design process for all the brands, teams and offices they’ve built in that time. “We needed a tool to help us centralize our files and work collaboratively at scale,&#34; said Stanley Wood, Head of User Experience at Volvo Cars. &#34;Figma enables us to do just that.”</p><p>In this new tier of Figma, we’ve also expanded privacy options, giving admins more fine-grained control over who sees what. In addition to <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/20-permissions">the existing project and file permissions</a>, they can now set entire teams to:</p><ol><li>Open (anyone can join)</li><li>Closed (anyone can view the team but must request access to join/edit projects)</li><li>Secret (no one can see the team unless they’re invited)</li></ol><p>You can structure teams in the way that makes the most sense for your organization. At Uber, for example, there’s many independent products all operating under the Uber umbrella, like Uber Freight and Uber Eats (in addition to Uber’s ride-sharing business). Previously, they had issues with fragmentation. Files didn’t have a consolidated home and lived in a lot of places —— hard-drives, cloud storage, third-party plugins. </p><p>“We were looking for a way to get people in the right place at the right time — in the right team with the right assets,” said Jeff Jura, Staff Product Designer who focuses on Uber’s design systems. </p><p>After partnering with us on the Beta, Uber decided to migrate the whole company over. They now do 90% of their product design work — including the Rider and Driver apps — in Figma. </p><p>“We embraced the organic nature of allowing teams to operate on their own, but still come out and see the global aspect,” said Jeff. “It spread like wildfire.” </p><h2 id="organization-wide-design-systems"><a href="#organization-wide-design-systems">Organization-wide design systems</a></h2><p>When Dustin Tanner joined Square to build out the financial technology company’s primary design system, he had one request: Build the design system in Figma.</p><p>“I say all the time that Figma is the only design systems tool. It&#39;s not hyperbole,” Dustin said. “Nothing else makes sense. It&#39;s the only tool where you can do everything in one place and that centralization is critical.”</p><p>Figma Organization expands on this design system functionality. For the first time, teams can share Component and Style libraries, so multiple services can use the same collection of assets. </p><p>This allowed Square to migrate the company to Figma, transitioning 100+ designers working on 25+ products. They now share and maintain 6 unique design systems spanning iOS, Android, and web in our tool.</p><p>Everyone is automatically granted access to the component library for Square’s Point of Sale product. If a team working on a different product, like Square for Restaurants, has a particular design need — like creating a new customer profile — they can see how the Point of Sale product handles that situation by browsing its design system. </p><p>For the sake of consistency, they can adapt the structure of the form while retaining their own personal branding. Because Figma’s on the web, the different assets will stay connected to each other.</p><p>“Everyone&#39;s looking at a single source of truth —— the exact same components that are the exact same version in the same tool. That&#39;s what Figma does for a design system,” said Dustin.</p><p>When designers need to add new Components or Styles or tweak existing ones, they can do that from their master design system file. They hit two buttons, and anyone who has used the Component in their own files is automatically notified. </p><p>That speed of execution is equally important to restaurant delivery company Deliveroo. “When we alter our master library, everything gets updated in one single swoop,” says Raphaël Guilleminot, Senior Design Manager Deliveroo. “It makes it a lot easier to change things at scale.&#34;</p><p>Lastly, let’s take a look at how Figma Organization alleviates administrative tedium. Things like Shared Fonts and Single Sign-on will make design op managers’ lives a lot easier.</p><p>For example, Jeff at Uber doesn’t have to spend any time onboarding new hires to the design system. They can just log in with their work email, and they’ll have access to everything they need, including Uber icon libraries and components. They don’t have to download software or procure license codes or connect to cloud storage. </p><p>They’ll also have access to all of Uber’s fonts, because Figma Organization comes with a new Shared Fonts feature. Admins can preload brand fonts into the tool, so that everyone can access them without installing a font helper or figuring out where the font files live.</p><p>“The designer can start designing immediately,” said Jeff. “The nature of Figma lets people get in, start asking questions, and feeling things out on their own.”</p><p>With Figma Organization, companies have total control over the security and visibility of things. If an employee leaves, they can be deactivated from Figma via their Single Sign-on. Contractors can be granted access to individual teams or projects. Admins can lock down files so anyone outside the organization will hit a 404 page if they type in a company URL.</p><p>With these new link access controls, people can share designs without worrying about a leak. That in turn facilitates more collaboration and feedback cycles.</p><p>“After that first experience of sending a Figma URL out and seeing others immediately jump in the file, there really is no going back for our team,” said Bryan Haggerty, a Senior Design Manager at Twitter. “By next year I imagine most product design teams will have adopted Figma as their primary UI design tool.”</p><h2 id="want-more-information"><a href="#want-more-information">Want more information?</a></h2><p>If you can’t tell from this article, we <em> really </em> believe in the power of web-based design. We’ve seen first hand how it transforms the design process for teams of all shapes and sizes. A big thanks to all of our enthusiastic beta partners who provided great feedback to get us to today —— it’s been five months of working together to produce this enterprise-ready product. </p><p>There’s a lot more features to Figma Organization than just those highlighted here, so check out <a href="https://www.figma.com/organization/">this information page</a> for more details. If it sounds like something you’d like to learn more about, you can reach us at sales at figma dot com.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma&#39;s engineering values</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-engineering-values/</link>
      <description>We’re sharing these values as a resource for those who might be interested in joining us someday and an example for folks putting together their own team values.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It can be difficult to scale an engineering team that’s executing well. This is a group of people who are doing great work together, but you’re going to add more engineers and people will grow and change. Without falling into the “monoculture” failure mode — where you only hire people exactly like yourselves, and where difference is ostracized rather than celebrated — how do you ensure you maintain the important parts of how you work together?</p><p>This was exactly the question <a href="https://www.figma.com/files/recent">Figma</a> faced, and as a solution, we decided to codify our engineering values — how we build products and how we work together. The entire team came together to discuss topics ranging from specific behaviors and individual priorities to team traditions and processes, and even the company’s competitive advantages and our hopes for the future of Figma itself. The result was the following four values, each attempting to encapsulate an important aspect of how we work together.</p><p>We strove for values that were descriptive, not aspirational; we “shipped” these believing that as a team we already fully embodied them. Thus these values can be used as a yardstick to make decisions with and a guide for how we want to grow, rather than a forcing function to change ourselves. Additionally, implicit in each value is a tradeoff — something that we give up. For each of these values, you could imagine a hypothetical tech company valuing the opposite. A generic value like “write good code” or “try your best” does no good, because nobody would ever seriously espouse the opposite.</p><p>We’re sharing these values as a resource for those who might be interested in joining us someday and an example for folks putting together their own team values.</p><h2 id="communicate-early-and-often"><a href="#communicate-early-and-often">Communicate early and often</a></h2><p><em>Don’t wait until code review to share your direction; solving something together is better than solving it independently; assume best intentions when receiving feedback.</em></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e981675a5430436e721566d5d33b4a53e61b734-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e981675a5430436e721566d5d33b4a53e61b734-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e981675a5430436e721566d5d33b4a53e61b734-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e981675a5430436e721566d5d33b4a53e61b734-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4e981675a5430436e721566d5d33b4a53e61b734-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Figma is, above everything, a collaboration tool. This collaboration-first attitude is reflected in the way we build software (and of course, our engineering team are extremely active Figma users 🙂). The archetype of the cloistered genius can be tempting — we all want to be the solo rockstar engineer who goes heads down and emerges days later with a perfect solution metaphorically chiseled from stone. But at Figma, we’ve built an engineering team with huge depth and breadth of knowledge. We don’t want to throw that expertise away — hence our first value, communicate early and often.</p><p>Communicating early and often ensures that work isn’t done in a vacuum. By sharing design documents, product specs, or even rough architecture drawings (usually in — you guessed it — Figma), we ensure that ideas are vetted early and issues can be spotted and resolved before we invest too much time in solutions that aren’t right. By normalizing enthusiastic sharing of works-in-progress, we make it easier for people to ask for help and input when they’re unsure how to approach a problem, as well as create opportunities for organic teaching and learning — for the benefit of the person sharing as well as the people being shared with. There undeniably exist projects and engineers where the heads-down approach could work; but the global maximum comes from ensuring communication happens every step of the way.</p><p>This isn’t to say we’re dogmatic about communication process. Sometimes code is the easiest and most effective way to communicate or discuss an idea. And of course when fixing a bug or throwing together a quick, obvious change, we don’t invest the time in multiple rounds of communication beforehand.</p><p>Additionally, communicating early and often only works if we’re serious about being receptive to input. So along with sharing works-in-progress, we work to listen to all the feedback that the act of sharing generates. This can be difficult — we’ve all had the challenging experience of sharing a deeply held opinion about how to approach a problem, only to discover that others disagree — but by ensuring that we’re sharing early, we minimize the cost of shifting direction. More later on how our values encourage us to think about feedback.</p><p>By living this value, we trade off the risk of slowed decision-making due to a large number of voices in the room. It is not always easy for a large group of people to discuss and have equal say in making decisions. This value pushes us to not only communicate as broadly as possible but also to take all feedback seriously, which can lead us to spend many cycles iterating on communication and ensuring every voice is heard.</p><h2 id="lift-your-team"><a href="#lift-your-team">Lift your team</a></h2><p><em>Help others grow; strive to make people feel better, not worse; strive to create an inclusive culture supporting diverse opinions; be solution oriented.</em></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c8b43f359f1c05c3f5a86186f13028e545fa188-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c8b43f359f1c05c3f5a86186f13028e545fa188-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c8b43f359f1c05c3f5a86186f13028e545fa188-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c8b43f359f1c05c3f5a86186f13028e545fa188-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c8b43f359f1c05c3f5a86186f13028e545fa188-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Software engineering is not a single player activity. At Figma, we’ve been fortunate to build a culture based on strong, respectful, positive relationships and early values discussions focused on how we build and maintain those relationships. Key to that theme was the idea of lifting each other up and working to make each other better, however we can. Lifting your team means prioritizing each other’s success and happiness over other considerations, and it’s our second engineering value. </p><p>More than the other values, the wording here is nuanced; it’s not “lift your company.” Engineering is a long process that must be sustainable and asking an engineering team to think of the company before themselves can lead to burnout. Instead, lifting your team is about your fellow engineers -- making sure that you’re trying not only to be successful yourself, but that you’re lifting the people around you as you do so.</p><p>This can mean many things, and play out in many ways. Most straightforwardly, it means an atmosphere of constant learning, mentorship and growth. Weekly tech talks, formal on-boarding mentorship and even simple encouragement to learn new skills have been a staple of Figma’s engineering team for as long as anyone can remember.</p><p>But it also governs how we interact with each other on a more basic level. As a result of our emphasis on communicating early and often, we frequently find ourselves in the position of giving feedback to each other. This value describes norms that ensure feedback is thoughtfully delivered and focuses on ideas, not people; feedback that insults someone, belittles their work, or talks down is not effective feedback at all. Similarly, receptiveness to feedback -- taking ideas seriously, no matter who they come from, and working to make sure everyone has equal opportunity to participate in conversations -- means that we get the best outcomes (in addition to making sure that everyone is welcome in our engineering team).</p><p>Ensuring that everyone, no matter their identity or background, is welcome at our company requires institutional investment, not just individual commitment. We hold company-wide initiatives like bias trainings and try to systemically adopt learnings from them into our processes. We have a recurring reading group focused on topics of identity, inclusion and psychological safety; two recent readings have been <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073P53DVL/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Ijeoma Oluo’s So You Want To Talk About Race</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XJZ2BM3/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">Ellen Pao’s Reset</a>. These are spearheaded by our DE&amp;I (“Diversity, Equity and Inclusion”) sub-committee focused on inclusion internally at Figma.</p><p>This value also plays out in our retrospective, learning-from-mistakes mode. Especially when examining a problem - a project that came in late, an outage, a serious bug - it’s easy and sometimes cathartic to fall into finger-pointing mode. But this is damaging no matter where the fingers are pointed. Blaming a team member for a bug makes them feel bad, and makes them less likely to try to build things in the future; blaming someone not in the room (or at the company) makes everyone wonder how they’re talked about when they’re absent; blaming yourself makes your team feel like they should do the same to themselves when they make mistakes. But by removing finger-pointing from the picture, and talking about the problem only in terms of solutions - how do we fix the issue going forward, how do we prevent this from happening again - we can drive effective learning without making people feel worse.</p><p>What we trade off by living this value is having to constantly work to ensure we’re not becoming conflict-averse. Taken to its extreme, this value could lead to a group of people who are afraid to disagree with each other on anything. Some engineering cultures, concerned about this failure mode, attempt to drive in the opposite direction by encouraging head-to-head confrontation. But this value is intended to encourage thoughtful, respectful, positive relationships with each other, whether we agree or disagree.</p><h2 id="craftsmanship"><a href="#craftsmanship">Craftsmanship</a></h2><p><em>When solving a problem, do so sustainably; always strive to improve our process and learn from missteps.</em></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2b0a839d58c305e9ff53173cd153949b08de79de-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2b0a839d58c305e9ff53173cd153949b08de79de-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2b0a839d58c305e9ff53173cd153949b08de79de-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2b0a839d58c305e9ff53173cd153949b08de79de-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2b0a839d58c305e9ff53173cd153949b08de79de-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Figma is a tool that people use to get work done - we’re a critical part of the design process at thousands of companies around the world, including some of the largest and most fast-moving companies in a variety of industries. This is exciting to be a part of, but more than anything for the engineering team it’s a responsibility. Any bug — any outage — is something that may stand firmly in the way of a user getting their job done, and we want to live up to the trust that our users put in us and do our absolute best to ensure they stay productive. Living up to that trust is the heart of our third value, craftsmanship.</p><p>Craftsmanship is about thoughtfulness and care in the work we do. It means being deliberate about what we build and how possible it will be to maintain and extend in the future. A solution that will require revisiting in a month -- because it’s not scaling, because it has a ton of bugs, because it doesn’t support all the use cases it needs to -- is not useful to us and ultimately will generate pain for our users. For a deep example of craftsmanship playing out in our product development process, look no further than the story of the exploration that went into building the <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/desperately-seeking-squircles/">Squircles feature</a>.</p><p>It also means learning from past mistakes to avoid making them in the future. We do retrospectives for every project, to ensure we’re constantly looking for opportunities to improve (even from projects that went smoothly) and so we can identify and consciously propagate those things that went well.</p><p>This isn’t to say we’re perfectionists; some projects, like a beta version of a feature we expect to change heavily before releasing to the public at large, can be “sustainable” even with clear imperfection as long as it doesn’t get in the way of what we’re trying to learn from the beta. And even for final products, endless polish is as unsustainable as none. But this value pushes us to plan thoughtfully and ensure we learn from our mistakes.</p><p>What we trade off by living this value is (sometimes) day-to-day speed. It’s easy to imagine an engineering team that emphasizes moving fast over keeping things stable and bug-free — like a team building a product that isn’t responsible for important user data and doesn’t support anyone’s livelihood. But given the role the Figma product plays in the lives of our users, we feel it’s worth it to ensure we hold a high quality bar for them. And in the long run, being thoughtful about how we build often reduces the complexity of ongoing development and new features regardless.</p><h2 id="prioritize-impact"><a href="#prioritize-impact">Prioritize impact</a></h2><p><em>We can only solve so many problems at once, so pick your battles; things are built with a shelf-life in mind and that’s ok.</em></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8637f7fd50d3cef5fef20a52e01fe742c2d97c7-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8637f7fd50d3cef5fef20a52e01fe742c2d97c7-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8637f7fd50d3cef5fef20a52e01fe742c2d97c7-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8637f7fd50d3cef5fef20a52e01fe742c2d97c7-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d8637f7fd50d3cef5fef20a52e01fe742c2d97c7-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>It’s well believed on the Figma team that design tooling will never be “solved”; the space of interesting problems to solve is gigantic (as a quick perusal of the “Feature Requests” section in the <a href="https://spectrum.chat/figma/feature-requests">Figma Spectrum community</a> will attest). Furthermore, we’re a small team, competing with companies staffed with orders of magnitude more employees than us. </p><p>What do we do first? Our final value, prioritize impact, reflects our drive as a team to focus on the things that matter the most to our users (current and future) above all else.</p><p>Prioritizing impact is something that just about every tech company will do - it’s hard to find a company (outside of perhaps research divisions) that decides to work on projects with no regard to what impact they’ll have. But it’s something we do with rigorous specificity. How much will this feature matters to users, and how many of them? If we think past our users of today to where we want to see the Figma product grow tomorrow, next month, or next year, will those users’ needs be met? We tend to rely on concrete data — e.g., the number of users hitting a specific bug or requesting a feature — but also on qualitative questions like impact on user experience.</p><p>With an engineering team that comfortably fits around a table and all know each others’ names and faces, we don’t have the bandwidth to spare on projects that aren’t the most important thing to be doing.</p><p>Prioritizing impact doesn’t just inform how we pick between projects, but also how we approach them. Our third value, craftsmanship, reflects our drive to be thoughtful and sustainable in how we build. But prioritizing impact ensures that we don’t go too far — that is, we don’t over-engineer in the name of sustainability. A solution that will last a year, and be built in a week, is often better than a solution that will last three years and be built in a month. For an example, our multiplayer feature that allows concurrent viewing and editing of a design file by multiple users was unveiled in <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/multiplayer-editing-in-figma/">September 2016</a>; a year and a half later, we rebuilt the server that powered it from the bottom up using a more <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/">scalable technology stack</a>. While we could have aimed for that level of scalability from the beginning, thoughtfully postponing that work allowed us to focus attention on other features in the intervening time and wait to see how necessary that work truly was.</p><p>As with all values, there’s trade offs. Sometimes, we have to pass over the more out there and exciting projects, which can be undeniably frustrating. It is probably not an exaggeration to say that every engineer has half-a-dozen project ideas in their back pockets they’d love to work on — this is what made our Maker Week this past summer so fruitful! This value lets us explicitly admit that sometimes the most exciting projects aren’t the most important right now and gives us a framework to decide when a moonshot is worth tackling.</p><h2 id="epilogue"><a href="#epilogue">Epilogue</a></h2><p>Values aren’t something that a team can simply write down once and call “done”; they’re meant to be the starting point of an ongoing conversation about how they want to work together. We’ve rolled our engineering values into our interview and onboarding processes at Figma, and are learning more about what they do and don’t represent about the important parts of who we are as a team. We may keep iterating — we may not. (Maybe we’ll even figure out how to make them grammatically parallel!) But it’s exciting to have a starting point.</p><p><em>If these values resonate with you, we’d love to hear from you.

      <title>Designing an open financial system at Coinbase</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/coinbase-case-study/</link>
      <description>Coinbase designs an open financial system through an open design process with Figma.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Cryptocurrency and the rise of the Bitcoin have created a financial phenomenon. Just as the Internet revolutionized the distribution of information in the 90s, cryptocurrency is revolutionizing the modern financial system - one Bitcoin at a time. While this new and decentralized system may be intimidating to some, many believe an open financial system can spark economic growth, unlock a new wave of innovation and empower billions of people. </p><p>As the global financial market takes shape, one company is at the center - Coinbase. With more than 20 Million users worldwide, Coinbase makes it easy for anyone to buy, sell, and manage digital currency. Products like Coinbase Consumer and Wallet have been able to bring crypto mainstream by abstracting away the complexities of blockchain and making exchange easy for new users… and that all starts with good design.</p><h2 id="open-financial-system-open-design"><a href="#open-financial-system-open-design">Open Financial System → Open Design</a></h2><p>The Coinbase mission is to create an open financial system for the world. To deliver on this vision, the design team has four guiding principles: to guide, empower, humanize and simplify. For Connie Yang, director of design, these principals help tackle the basic challenges when designing for crypto. She explains in her recent blog post, <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/why-design-is-the-killer-app-for-crypto-dcb00d2b1fa6">Why Design is the Killer App for Crypto</a>, “alongside all the brilliant protocol developers, investors, and entrepreneurs — we need more people thinking about guidance, education, and use cases — people who can make technical ideas accessible to all.” </p><p>Just as openness and transparency are inherent pillars in the space, the same can be applied to design. For Yang’s team, design is open. It is a collaborative, iterative process. It is not exclusive to designers but inclusive of all roles. Anyone can participate and they are encouraged to do so. But it wasn’t always that way… at least in practice. </p><p>Like many design teams, the siloed nature of tools restricted the Coinbase designers to fully embrace the concept of open design. To compensate, their tech stack and workflows grew exponentially. With one tool for designing, a different tool for prototyping and yet another tool for handing off to engineers, it became overwhelming. Context switching across platforms became a challenge and versioning issues became a nightmare. But when Zach Krassner, senior designer, introduced the team to Figma, things began to shift.</p><div><blockquote><p>It was the easiest roll out I’ve ever had because all I had to do was send out a link - it was amazing!</p></blockquote></div><p>For Krassner, because Figma is browser-based, everything is available online and multiple people can design together in one space, “it was like a designer’s dream,” he says. Finally, the team had a space where they could design in the open, solicit feedback and iterate together. Krassner explains, “When all types of people can come together, put their thoughts into a product and you can collect it all in one place rather than switching between a bunch of different places, that is real value.”</p><h2 id="rocking-out-with-together"><a href="#rocking-out-with-together">Rocking out with together</a></h2><p>Centralized on a single design tool, the team hit their groove - literally. Because files can be centrally stored and are accessible to all, designers, product managers, engineers and even leadership can stay up to date and have input on any given asset. As Yang explains it, “we weren’t designing behind a black box anymore.” As a result, the team could move faster. Yitong Zhang, product designer, explains, “We now have a really tight communication loop between stakeholders - there&#39;s no bureaucracy around it, everybody gets their opinion heard and it’s tracked in Figma.” And Michelle Haydu, growth designer, agrees, “things now feel a lot crisper.” </p><div><blockquote><p>For the first time, designers, PMs, engineers can all speak in the same language, in the same location... in Figma.</p></blockquote></div><p>But the real music is made during the design team’s jam sessions. Yes, it is just as it sounds. Anytime the team gets an ad hoc request like new swag designs, posters, etc. the team huddles in their Design Lounge, opens a new Figma file and they rock ‘n’ roll. Yang explains, “We can all come together to creatively collaborate on something fun. It’s magical - that could never happen before.” </p><h2 id="a-brighter-future-for-all"><a href="#a-brighter-future-for-all">A brighter future for all</a></h2><p>Today the team is faster, more nimble and aligned. “Figma creates a new level of collaboration that never really existed before in design,” says Yang. The team is able to work together and ship products faster. But this is just the beginning - a culture is a living and breathing thing. As Nina Samarguliani, design manager, puts it, “we need to continue to foster an inclusive and diverse culture and put in place the right tools that empower designers to do their best work, not complicate it.”</p><p>Pssst, Coinbase is <a href="https://www.coinbase.com/careers">hiring</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What is a <a href="https://www.designsystems.com">design system</a>, exactly? Who are they for? When is the right time to create one?</p><p>Best practices are emerging amid the diversity of approaches. We partnered <a href="https://www.clarityconf.com/">with Clarity</a>, the design systems conference, to paint a picture of the common themes. We surveyed 499 practitioners across the field to share their perspective on topics ranging from when they started their design system to whether they have a dedicated team to maintain it.</p><p>We asked a mix of multiple choice and open-ended questions, and drew 8 high level takeaways from people&#39;s answers.

Design systems are still in their infancy</a></h2><p>It’s difficult to pinpoint the exact start of the digital design system movement. There were many instigating moments, from the publishing of <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/brad-frosts-atomic-design-build-systems-not-pages/">Brad Frost’s atomic design book</a> to the advent of <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/googles-material-design-a-design-system-with-mass-adoption/">Google&#39;s Material Design system</a> in 2014. That was less than half a decade ago, so many companies’ design systems are still in their infancy.</p><p><strong>Two thirds</strong> of respondents to our survey said their design system was only at stage 1 or 2 -- i.e. their system isn’t documented (stage 1) or they don’t have a dedicated team building one (stage 2). The aspiration for more is there -- <strong>86%</strong> of the respondents wish their design system was at stage 3 or 4, where there’s full-time employees maintaining their system, and the system is public (like <a href="https://polaris.shopify.com/">Shopify’s Polaris</a>).</p><p>At the Clarity conference, speaker <a href="https://twitter.com/danmall">Dan Mall</a> predicted that although design systems are still relatively new, the methodology behind them is here to stay. Much like responsive design practices, design systems are becoming “the way we do things now.” </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/841477dd97c1ea44277c24b9fb8dd70a115ad8f9-1600x1332.png?rect=0,0,1599,1332&amp;w=670&amp;h=558&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/841477dd97c1ea44277c24b9fb8dd70a115ad8f9-1600x1332.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/841477dd97c1ea44277c24b9fb8dd70a115ad8f9-1600x1332.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/841477dd97c1ea44277c24b9fb8dd70a115ad8f9-1600x1332.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/841477dd97c1ea44277c24b9fb8dd70a115ad8f9-1600x1332.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/841477dd97c1ea44277c24b9fb8dd70a115ad8f9-1600x1332.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="_2-you-don-t-need-a-team-to-justify-a-design"><a href="#_2-you-don-t-need-a-team-to-justify-a-design">2.

By offering fast and reliable delivery accessible via a well designed app, where customers can track where their food is on their phones, Deliveroo has experienced astounding revenue growth and was announced as Europe&#39;s fastest growing company by the <a href="https://www.ft.com/reports/europes-fastest-growing-companies">Financial Times</a> earlier this year.</p><h2 id="cooking-up-designs-across-silos"><a href="#cooking-up-designs-across-silos">Cooking up designs across silos</a></h2><p>The team behind Deliveroo’s magic consists of more than 40 people across content, research and design who work together to create products for consumers, riders and restaurants. The design team has ramped up its efforts with new staff to keep up with the rapid growth and expansion of the company. </p><p>However, as the team expanded, silos developed among the various product groups. Disparate tools used throughout the design process - like Sketch, Dropbox, Zeplin, Abstract - further accentuated these islands. “We had too many tools and silos, which prevented us from collaborating effectively, maintaining consistency across designs, and being as nimble as we need to be,” says Raphaël Guilleminot, senior design manager at Deliveroo. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c6da4cdd99e2bb1f05c64dab6e93eb50bb6059b0-1600x600.jpg?rect=0,0,1600,599&amp;w=670&amp;h=251&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c6da4cdd99e2bb1f05c64dab6e93eb50bb6059b0-1600x600.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c6da4cdd99e2bb1f05c64dab6e93eb50bb6059b0-1600x600.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c6da4cdd99e2bb1f05c64dab6e93eb50bb6059b0-1600x600.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c6da4cdd99e2bb1f05c64dab6e93eb50bb6059b0-1600x600.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c6da4cdd99e2bb1f05c64dab6e93eb50bb6059b0-1600x600.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Image from Deliveroo.Design </figcaption></figure><p>Despite constant communication, the team felt there was still a disconnect. “We had file synching issues across different versions of our app,” says Guilleminot. “To try to manage this, we were shooting files back and forth on email, which is very tedious.”</p><p>Aimee Quantrill, who leads the <a href="https://medium.com/deliveroo-design/why-we-run-content-design-days-and-why-you-should-too-b1ae2a96ac5">content design</a> team at Deliveroo, also believes the previous design tools were inhibiting collaboration. “The way that we used to work was like a custody agreement,” she says. “The product designer would have the file in the morning and then the content designer would have it in the afternoon.&#34;</p><div><blockquote><p>We constantly had to keep double checking with each other, sending each other screenshots and Slack messages.

After a successful pilot, Deliveroo adopted Figma, making the effort of managing various design files and keeping them in sync a thing of the past.  </p><div><blockquote><p>Before we were taking screenshot and sending each other Slack messages or emails or Google docs, because we had to use a separate document for the content.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="putting-open-and-collaborative-on-the-menu"><a href="#putting-open-and-collaborative-on-the-menu">Putting &#39;open and collaborative&#39; on the menu</a></h2><p>According to Guilleminot, Figma has changed the way the design team at Deliveroo works. “Figma has turned us into a much more open and collaborative design culture,” he says. Quantrill agrees. “It’s massively demystified the way that design works, so people can see how we work and think,” she says. “Being able to work collaboratively on one document means that product designers, researchers, engineers, and product managers can all see the process of content design.”</p><p>The open, collaborative culture extends beyond the design team. “We can get input from people around the business who were maybe a bit nervous about doing that before,” says Quantrill. “Figma is much more accessible to people who aren’t design focused or working in the design field.”</p><p>Onboarding new designers is easier as well. “Because we’ve grown so fast over the last 11 months, and because content designers work with so many different stakeholders, one of the things we’re often required to do is to learn a lot of different tools,” says Quantrill. “It’s a lot easier when somebody joins the team now. We show them Figma, talk them through it, and then leave them to explore everyone’s work in their own time.”</p><div><blockquote><p>What’s great about working in Figma is that engineers can see all of the thinking that’s gone into the design and also propose edge cases. We can now talk about edge cases in a much more open way and understand and map them out.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="taste-testing-design-ideas-more-efficiently"><a href="#taste-testing-design-ideas-more-efficiently">Taste testing design ideas more efficiently</a></h2><p>Besides collaborating in the same file, the team at Deliveroo also appreciates that comments, thoughts, and opinions all live in one document. “What’s really cool with Figma is you can turn on comments and really get a sense of the project without having somebody walk you through it every single time,” says Quantrill. “It just feels like you’re much more connected to the actual work.”</p><p>Aisling Lee, product designer on the consumer core team, agrees. “Figma helps me give and receive feedback faster and more efficiently than before,” she says. “If I’m looking at someone else’s file, I can provide quick answers to questions and get feedback on those answers straightaway, which is great.”</p><p>Lee also describes how Figma has improved how Deliveroo runs design crits. “Before when we got feedback in a design crit, we’d write comments down on Post-It notes or type them into notes on our laptop and then translate the notes to the actual design file after the fact,” she says. “But with Figma, you can now comment straight beside the piece of user interface you’re working on.”</p><h2 id="cooking-up-designs-at-scale-with-a-design-system"><a href="#cooking-up-designs-at-scale-with-a-design-system">Cooking up designs at scale with a design system</a></h2><p>Another major benefit for Deliveroo is Figma helps the team get from idea to finished product quickly by taking the friction out of a multi-tool process. “Before we had to jump between four different pieces of software,” says Guilleminot. “Now that everything happens in Figma, we get to results faster.” </p><p>He credits the Deliveroo design system created in Figma with helping achieve that speed. “Many people build design systems for consistency,” he says. “And while that’s a good by-product to have, what we care about most is speed of execution.”</p><p>Deliveroo has one master library in Figma that holds all of its brand information and which feeds into two sub-libraries, one for its consumer products and one for internal tools. “What’s really great with Figma is that when we make changes to our master library, everything gets updated in one single swoop,” says Guilleminot. “It makes it a lot easier to make changes at scale.”</p><h2 id="elevating-design-across-the-company"><a href="#elevating-design-across-the-company">Elevating design across the company</a></h2><p>By effectively replacing five tools with Figma (Abstract, Dropbox, Marvel, Sketch and Zeplin), the teams work is not only streamlined but also, accessible company wide. Guilleminot believes using Figma has increased the understanding of the design team’s work within the growing Deliveroo company. “People have a sense that we’re not just drawing pretty pictures,” he explains. “With our work ‘out in the open,’ they see that we’re actually doing a lot of exploration and making products more delightful. Everyone from product managers to executives are looking at our work, and that elevates us in the company.”   </p><div><blockquote><p>Figma really understands what it’s like to work as a product designer day in and out. All the little things that we do that are normally tedious, Figma alleviates straightaway with features like Smart Selection. It’s the little things, but over time the little things really accumulate and make our lives much easier.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How we built the Figma design team</title>

      <description>An inside look into who we are and how we got here. Welcome Tori Hinn, Lucyné Babayan, Bradee Evans, and Marcin Wichary to the Figma Design team!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Note: This article was written a while ago, and as a fast moving company our team has continued to grow and evolve. To get to know our latest team members, visit <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/file/814575098768004426">this file on the Figma Community</a>.</em> </p><p>Just under a year ago, we only had one full-time core product designer and a few of us chipping in part-time toward feature work. It was tough to keep up with all the engineers, and we knew we had to hire fast to maintain high quality designs. But we also wanted to make sure it was done thoughtfully. Each person you add to a small team has a major effect in how you work — if you’re rowing on a small boat you notice each individual rower much more than you would if you were on a cruise ship.</p><p>Fast-forward a year. We now have a team of eight designers, a more seasoned and established culture with collaborative critiques, and clearer objectives and areas of ownership. We’re still new as a group and there’s a lot to improve, but we’re proud to have the foundations in place to build the future of design tools together.</p><p>At Figma, we believe design is best done in the open. After taking some time to ensure a transparent culture internally, we realized we wanted to share our methods with the broader design community. To put our money where our mouth is, we thought this would be a fun opportunity to provide an inside look into how we built our team.</p><h2 id="our-hiring-process"><a href="#our-hiring-process">Our hiring process</a></h2><p>When we first started interviewing designers, we suffered from unclear role expectations, inconsistencies in our interview questions and unfocused debates about candidates. There was a lot of room to improve, but as an early start up, we were all so busy wearing different hats that slowing down to rethink this process felt like a bit of a hurdle initially.</p><p>Fortunately, Niko attended <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyFVpXUHVXs&amp;feature=youtu.be">a wonderful and timely talk</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/notdetails">Joel Califa</a> on building design teams, which gave us a new tool to guide our process thoughtfully. As Joel explained, it takes place with three phases:</p><ol><li><strong>Learn:</strong> Look at every job description you can. Learn from people who’ve built teams (run questions by other leaders). Build an understanding of which skills or traits could be valuable on your team.</li><li><strong>Analyze:</strong> Use that understanding to build a comprehensive list of skills. Filter that list down to skills that the company genuinely needs. Filter that down to skills that the Design team should be responsible for. Then to baseline skills that every Designer needs to know.</li><li><strong>Evolve:</strong> Have you realized a new gap on your team? Has the company’s or team’s needs changed? What do you need right now? When possible, grow people internally.</li></ol><p>Following this guide, we independently wrote up what we wanted out of our next team member, then started merging and consolidating that list in Figma to build consensus. It looked something like this:</p><figure><figcaption>Building out our requirements together in Figma </figcaption></figure><p>It’s very rare to find designers who can do absolutely everything, and this process helped us focus on what was actually necessary versus what we were willing to compromise on.</p><p>Here’s where we landed for the core expectations of a Product Designer at Figma:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eecb74410e7bccff26ae11c9712759e8993ed462-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;h=651&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eecb74410e7bccff26ae11c9712759e8993ed462-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eecb74410e7bccff26ae11c9712759e8993ed462-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eecb74410e7bccff26ae11c9712759e8993ed462-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eecb74410e7bccff26ae11c9712759e8993ed462-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/eecb74410e7bccff26ae11c9712759e8993ed462-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>We then ran a similar exercise for cultural components of the interview to make sure we brought on people who would be a good fit for Figma, aligned with the company’s core values (Be Bold, Be Inclusive, Have Fun). </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef51cb2c0e7114999a4e8176623b1874e1e70dd0-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;h=651&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef51cb2c0e7114999a4e8176623b1874e1e70dd0-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef51cb2c0e7114999a4e8176623b1874e1e70dd0-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef51cb2c0e7114999a4e8176623b1874e1e70dd0-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef51cb2c0e7114999a4e8176623b1874e1e70dd0-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef51cb2c0e7114999a4e8176623b1874e1e70dd0-1485x1443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>We’d recently taken a diversity and inclusion workshop, which explained how people often bend criteria during interviews unconsciously to fit their existing bias. This applies to both soft skills and hard skills — for example, if you think good designers are assertive, you may look for it even if you agreed as a team it wasn’t important for the role. To help combat this, we took the list of qualities we wanted and used it directly in our interview feedback form in Lever (our recruiting and hiring tool) to prompt meaningful focused feedback rather than just an open ended text field.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fff20c70174e8a50fefc2750f0186dc78a717e4-1600x771.png?rect=0,0,1599,771&amp;w=670&amp;h=323&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fff20c70174e8a50fefc2750f0186dc78a717e4-1600x771.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fff20c70174e8a50fefc2750f0186dc78a717e4-1600x771.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fff20c70174e8a50fefc2750f0186dc78a717e4-1600x771.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fff20c70174e8a50fefc2750f0186dc78a717e4-1600x771.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fff20c70174e8a50fefc2750f0186dc78a717e4-1600x771.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>We added the requirements directly into our feedback tool, Lever, for clearer assessments </figcaption></figure><p>We also judged ourselves on the existing criteria. We were hoping doing this would reveal new gaps in our team to inform ways to round out what we were missing, but actually there were not many surprises. It was still valuable though because we wouldn’t want to evaluate others on something we couldn’t evaluate ourselves on first. It was also a humbling experience and ensured we were all being realistic about strengths and weaknesses.</p><p>Of course, the hiring exercise alone doesn’t just magically drop the people you need into your team — a lot of work has to be done sourcing, asking around, and meeting people to find the right fit. But at least now we had the knowledge of what we actually needed to properly conduct the search. One trick that helped us a lot was working closely with our amazing recruiter, Korin, by embedding her into the design team, joining our critiques and team meetings so she could help us hire the right talent and speak to what we do day-to-day more accurately with first-hand experience.

She’d worked across various domains from making websites and working in agencies to designing the interface for <a href="https://www.shapertools.com/">the first handheld CNC machine</a>. She’s one of the most inquisitive people we met, always looking to understand more about why things are the way they are — we’re lucky to have her onboard.</p><h3 id=""><a href="#"></a></h3><p>Then came Marcin — a UI veteran who’s worked at Google, Medium, and Code for America. From having <a href="https://www.google.com/doodles/30th-anniversary-of-pac-man">replicated Pac-man into a Google doodle</a> (down to matching the bugs from the arcade game), to caring about <a href="https://medium.design/crafting-link-underlines-on-medium-7c03a9274f9">tiny details like underlines</a> and <a href="https://medium.design/quotation-marks-c8993b54417c">quotation marks</a> on Medium, to building a <a href="https://medium.com/@mwichary/youre-a-street-designer-you-just-dont-know-it-yet-b5e83620e428">custom urban planning application</a>, we knew having someone with his passion for quality craft, tooling, and typography would be perfect for a design tool like Figma.</p><h3 id=""><a href="#"></a></h3><p>It’s hard to find a clearer fit than someone who’s spent the last 10 years of her life thinking about and building creative tools. Most of Bradee’s tenure was spent at Adobe, much of it on Photoshop. She’s passionate about designing in the open and creating tools that help us all create a more inclusive world. She loves new and novel interactions, having <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvgs1N_Xkdo">presented with Apple on stage at WWDC</a> to showcase the Photoshop touchbar. We love her creative expression in and outside of work — she recently designed and implemented a custom animated Halloween character on a big projection screen with camera and voice rigs to interact with trick-or-treating passerby&#39;s.</p><h3 id=""><a href="#"></a></h3><p>Finally, the most recent addition to the team, we are lucky to have found Tori as our first Creative Director who will be helping us help evolve the Figma brand. Previously a freelance art director and designer, she’s worked with clients like Apple, Etsy, Google, and many others. Tori has a wonderful leadership approach, carefully listening to and understanding the team’s goals and motivations to build products collaboratively. As someone who cares deeply about empowering others, we knew she’d be a great manager and leader for our communication design team. She also <a href="https://gradientsdaily.com/">makes epic gradients</a>.</p><p>Lucy, Marcin, Bradee and Tori are joining the rest of the Figma design team:</p><h3 id=""><a href="#"></a></h3><p>During a hack day around Design Tools, Niko started working with a team building Sketch Runner, a plugin for Sketch. At the time, he was still studying Interaction Design in Schwäbisch Gmünd (it has a 🦄 as coat of arms!). His Sketch Runner experience made him think more deeply about the tools he was using, and after graduating (and a stop at Shopify in Ottawa) he decided to work on design tools full time.</p><h3 id=""><a href="#"></a></h3><p>Because of his background in advertising, Peter is a bit of a visual fire hydrant. He’s Figma’s Communication Designer, so he works cross functionally to make product GIFs, internal presentations, websites and other assets. A lot of his inspiration comes from nature, which he considers to be the best designer.</p><h3 id=""><a href="#"></a></h3><p>As the longest standing member of the team having joined ~3 years ago, Rasmus has been a core backbone of Figma Design. A Swedish native, he was one of the first employees of Spotify in Sweden in 2006 where he led the company’s design and product direction. In 2011, he moved to the United States to work at Facebook and then Dropbox. He recently designed an open-source typeface for interface design, <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter UI</a>, which has since been used by the likes of Github, Japanese soccer league, and the UK gov.</p><h3 id=""><a href="#"></a></h3><p>Noah moved back to San Francisco last year to be Figma’s first Design Manager. Before that he led the design team at ClassPass in NYC, and the iOS Search team at Google in Mountain View. He also spent some time teaching designers to code as an advisor at Framer. He studied Human-Computer Interaction at Carnegie Mellon and is a Pittsburgh native who’s convinced it’s the most underrated city in the world.</p><p>We’re proud of the diversity of skills each member has to offer, making it easier to tackle a range of problems in different ways:</p><figure></figure><h2 id="getting-to-know-each-other"><a href="#getting-to-know-each-other">Getting to know each other</a></h2><p>To help us understand each others’ preferences and styles, Marcin recently had a fun idea of running a “Trading Cards” activity together in Figma. We wanted to know things like: who prefers working in the morning vs the evening? What parts of the design process do you feel most comfortable with vs challenged by? What’s your design super power?

      <title>Our path to creating a precise PDF Exporter</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/our-path-to-creating-the-highest-quality-pdf-exporter/</link>
      <description>Does Figma have PDF Export?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the <em>ephemeral</em> and changing world of digital design, PDF - a format born when software came in a box and phones had cords - remains essential. From iOS developers who import vector representations of designs to individuals who leverage its precise color handling for printing digital assets, PDF’s applications are vast. Unsurprisingly, the ability to export designs to PDF is perhaps the most requested feature here at Figma.</p><p>Today, we are excited to deliver on this request by introducing a PDF export option in Figma.  We paid special attention to quality so you can rely on it to represent your work accurately to clients and stakeholders.</p><h2 id="how-it-works"><a href="#how-it-works">How it works</a></h2><p>Turning your designs into a high-fidelity PDF is as simple as pushing a button. You can export a selection of layers or even an entire page. </p><p>Simply select whatever you wish (or nothing for the whole page), scroll to the bottom of the Properties Panel, pick the new PDF option, and enjoy!</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e824ead45ce93b8ff228198bdb004d2234b0ab9b-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e824ead45ce93b8ff228198bdb004d2234b0ab9b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e824ead45ce93b8ff228198bdb004d2234b0ab9b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e824ead45ce93b8ff228198bdb004d2234b0ab9b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e824ead45ce93b8ff228198bdb004d2234b0ab9b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Alternatively, to export all of the frames in a Figma page to a single, multi-page PDF file, choose the “Export Frames to PDF” option in the File Menu. Within the PDF file, each frame will be on its own page, ordered according to its position in Figma, from top-left working down to bottom right. </p><figure></figure><p>To see more details, check our our <a href="https://help.figma.com/importing-and-exporting/exporting-from-figma/export-options">documentation</a>. For the story of its creation and some highlights showing how we honed particular elements of the exporter, read on!</p><h2 id="building-the-foundation"><a href="#building-the-foundation">Building the foundation</a></h2><p>We pursue quality relentlessly at Figma. After poring over 1300 pages of documentation and scrutinizing existing libraries, we discovered existing tools forced us to make unacceptable compromises. So we decided to build our own PDF library from scratch. This gave us the control and precision necessary to meet the standards we strive to maintain for our users.</p><p>As a format, PDF is different from PNG because it contains a detailed description of your designs, not merely an image of them. This is how PDF text and drawings can look crisp at any zoom level - it’s fundamentally a vector format, like SVG, but much more complex. However, PDF descriptions can be hard to wrangle and optimize. Since PDF can contain embedded images alongside vector representations, this gives engineers an easy way out when things get difficult. It’s always possible to give up and rasterize on a complex effect or gradient and put in a picture of it rather than describing it precisely.</p><p>It’s exactly this compromise, to rasterize or to fight on, that we needed total control over in order to make our exporter really shine. This is especially critical for print applications when the output medium is large, or for digital applications where a variety of sizes of the same asset need to be generated. If we let some big, unsightly pixels show on your perfectly tuned work, we’d be letting you down, and we love you too much to do that!</p><h2 id="feature-highlights"><a href="#feature-highlights">Feature highlights</a></h2><p>With the foundational library in place, we met the challenge of representing complex design elements like shadows, blurs and gradients head on. But this is where PDF’s ambitious scope becomes a liability - no viewer supports the format completely. This is especially the case when using PDF’s sophisticated shading techniques. These attributes produce a minefield of bugs in viewers which we had to navigate. Here’s how we ensure your work comes out unscathed in the export process:</p><h4 id="shadows"><a href="#shadows">Shadows</a></h4><p>Drop shadows can be tricky to make look crisp and clean. The concept is simple enough: just make a stencil of the shape, fill it in and smudge out the edges. Inner shadows are sort of the inverse of this, but still very similar. This is straightforward to accomplish at the shader level in a graphics pipeline, but PDF doesn’t provide us with that level of control. So we have to synthesize the result in code.</p><p>To deliver high quality here, we finely rasterize the blurry parts region itself and make a soft mask out of it, allowing forms behind the shadow to remain sharp. We also take care to accurately clip the shadow or blur with vector methods where the blurred node’s boundary truncates the blur. This means that cracks will never appear between a blur and its parent path.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e51444a8d72bda71b17f8b366c2ec01c1111ed05-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e51444a8d72bda71b17f8b366c2ec01c1111ed05-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e51444a8d72bda71b17f8b366c2ec01c1111ed05-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e51444a8d72bda71b17f8b366c2ec01c1111ed05-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e51444a8d72bda71b17f8b366c2ec01c1111ed05-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h4 id="gradients"><a href="#gradients">Gradients</a></h4><p>Common gradients like the linear and elliptical types are relatively straightforward to make in PDF. In fact, the format provides shading techniques specifically for these purposes. Complex gradients on the other hand - angular types and Figma’s special diamond gradient - can be particularly tricky to recreate with precision.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4931fcc1e3417cb99eccb196db0fd250f4f3d10f-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4931fcc1e3417cb99eccb196db0fd250f4f3d10f-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4931fcc1e3417cb99eccb196db0fd250f4f3d10f-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4931fcc1e3417cb99eccb196db0fd250f4f3d10f-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4931fcc1e3417cb99eccb196db0fd250f4f3d10f-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The reason for this is twofold. First, the PDF feature set required to represent these is at a pretty low level, stitching together a patchwork of smaller, more simply colored regions. This is vastly superior to rasterization, but careful mathematical work is required to keep control of approximation and numerical error.</p><p>The second difficulty comes from the bugs that arise in viewers. For angular gradients in particular, PDF affords several elegant and sophisticated solutions to the problem, but only one, used in a particular way, is supported by all the major viewers (including OSX preview!) that our users depend on. This kind of delivery is only bought with sweat.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6276795db0e47664ed8b3a0de7576af6fc55b6f9-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6276795db0e47664ed8b3a0de7576af6fc55b6f9-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6276795db0e47664ed8b3a0de7576af6fc55b6f9-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6276795db0e47664ed8b3a0de7576af6fc55b6f9-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6276795db0e47664ed8b3a0de7576af6fc55b6f9-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="give-pdf-in-figma-a-spin"><a href="#give-pdf-in-figma-a-spin">Give PDF in Figma a spin!</a></h2><p>We are excited to add the graphical power and interchange utility of PDF to the ways Figma lets you communicate your designs to the world.

      <description>figma prototyping overlays</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Designing for today’s interfaces is more than just static screens linked together. And because designers often need to experience these interactive flows for activities like user testing, they create prototypes to bring their designs alive. But the process of creating prototypes is often repetitive, time consuming and downright painful — especially when designers want to show content on top of other content to mimic elements like sidebars, modals and popovers. </p><p>Today we are happy to announce that prototyping just got a whole lot more fun in Figma! With Figma’s new Overlays feature you can now show content flexibly on top of other content, interact with it and even open multiple overlays. Read on to learn how Overlays in Figma works…</p><h2 id="how-it-works"><a href="#how-it-works">How it works</a></h2><h3 id="simple-overlays"><a href="#simple-overlays">Simple Overlays</a></h3><p>We reimagined the basic delivery of overlays. Now after you add a prototype link to connect two frames, you will see a new option in the property panel. This option will allow you to set the destination frame as an overlay. Once selected, you can customize where the overlay is placed and how it should appear.</p><figure></figure><p>Our relative positioning supports use cases like modals and action sheets where you want to show the overlay in relation to the device. For other other use cases like tooltips and dropdowns, you can manually position it in relation to the object from which it is being opened. </p><h3 id="multiple-overlays"><a href="#multiple-overlays">Multiple Overlays</a></h3><p>But we didn’t stop there. In our increasingly interactive world, there are often situations where more than 2 overlays need to work together - think multi-step purchase flows and confirmation dialogues. We’re excited that now in Figma, designers can add multiple overlays on top of one another. And, best of all, setting up multiple overlays is just as simple as setting up a single overlay.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="interactions-on-overlays"><a href="#interactions-on-overlays">Interactions on Overlays</a></h3><p>Because prototypes are interactive experiences, we thought carefully about how to allow interactions on overlays. After connecting two frames, you have the choice to swap the frames. Swapping will replace the entire frame with the new one, but not dismiss an overlay. This allows you to add interactions, like hovering a button, to overlays, too!</p><figure></figure><h3 id="other-nitty-gritty-details"><a href="#other-nitty-gritty-details">Other nitty gritty details</a></h3><p>You can now select Back or Close directly on the canvas while dragging the overlay connection instead of selecting these options in the Layers panel.<br/>Keyboard shortcut: While dragging and hovering over your destination frame, you can hold the option key to quickly select the swap connection.<br/>Pro Tip: Leverage swap links for a more flexible ‘Back’ action that will skip over swap links to show the last frame from which you used navigate instead of defaulting to the preceding frame.</p><figure></figure><p>Check out this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t82XRda5DnY&amp;feature=youtu.be">video</a> to watch a step by step walk through and reference our documentation <a href="https://help.figma.com/prototyping/prototyping-with-overlays">here</a>. </p><h2 id="in-conclusion"><a href="#in-conclusion">In conclusion</a></h2><p>We hope Overlays will streamline all of your use cases for showing content flexibly on top of other content. It also compliments all the other powerful prototyping functionality that you already can access in Figma today - <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/the-finale-of-prototyping-week-interactions/">interactions</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-prototyping-now-with-transitions/">transitions</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-3-0/">device frames</a>, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-3-0/">fixed objects</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-3-0/">advanced scrolling</a>.</p><p>We want to give a shout out to everyone who helped us build this feature over the past few months - your feedback was incredibly valuable and helped shape today’s release.

      <title>Zoom streamlines the design workflow with Figma</title>

      <description>Everyday on every project, Figma continues playing a major role in contributing to the happiness of Zoom’s designers.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Video collaboration is imperative for any business, but it is especially so for the rapidly increasing number of companies with a global workforce. The right video conferencing solution, one with great user experience and reliability, is pivotal in making a collaborative workforce as productive and efficient as possible.</p><p>Zoom Video Communications, a leading video conferencing solution, offers an easy, reliable cloud platform for video and audio conferencing, collaboration, chat, and webinars across desktops, mobile devices, telephones, and conference rooms. </p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afb11c02812fb3bed76795fbecb5deac3c3915e2-3935x2616.png?rect=0,1,3935,2614&amp;w=670&amp;h=445&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afb11c02812fb3bed76795fbecb5deac3c3915e2-3935x2616.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afb11c02812fb3bed76795fbecb5deac3c3915e2-3935x2616.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afb11c02812fb3bed76795fbecb5deac3c3915e2-3935x2616.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afb11c02812fb3bed76795fbecb5deac3c3915e2-3935x2616.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/afb11c02812fb3bed76795fbecb5deac3c3915e2-3935x2616.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Image from zoom.us</figcaption></figure><h2 id="speed-bumps-in-the-design-workflow"><a href="#speed-bumps-in-the-design-workflow">Speed bumps in the design workflow</a></h2><p>Designers play an important role in the Zoom culture bringing the experiences that make customers happy into fruition. Each Zoom product has dedicated product designers, many located in multiple countries and time zones working remotely.</p><p>“We have a relatively lean design team, with a ratio of 1 designer to 10 engineers,” says Shawn Lan, Head of Design at Zoom. &#34;This means that we need tools that can help us communicate and collaborate efficiently and effectively with the engineering group, because we can’t literally talk to each and every engineer to explain the designs throughout a project.” </p><p>The Zoom team encountered a persistent problem - the design workflow consisted of disparate tools, adding friction for designers to manage the iterative design process. Like many teams, Zoom’s designers utilized a broad toolset - using Sketch as the basic design tool, Invision or Framer for prototyping, and Zeplin for engineering handoff.</p><p>Every new design iteration required syncing files between all the separate tools within the workflow. “For a single project, we would push out revisions to the various tools 10 to 20 times and then had to manage reviews across multiple tools, versions, and stakeholders,” says Lan. “It was a lot of manual work and wasted time, which could have been better spent on creative output.”</p><div><blockquote><p>What initially attracted me to Figma was the speed.</p></blockquote></div><p>Steven Crosby, a visual designer and illustrator at Zoom, found himself constantly iterating his designs throughout the entire design process. Over time, he started growing more and more frustrated with the plethora of tools he had to use.</p><h2 id="the-aha-moment-with-figma"><a href="#the-aha-moment-with-figma">The “aha” moment with Figma</a></h2><p>Crosby did some research and began looking into Figma as a potential solution to Zoom’s workflow inefficiencies. “What initially attracted me to Figma was the speed,” he says. “I was blown away by the frame rate when moving an object in Figma compared to other design tools I’ve used. Then I discovered how fantastic Figma’s integrated collaboration and commenting functionality is... and that’s when I knew I’d found the answer to our problems.” </p><p>After Crosby introduced Figma to Lan, the head of design immediately acknowledged the benefits it could bring to the entire Zoom design workflow. Not only would it help designers, it would also strengthen collaboration between the rest of the company. “I was really impressed with Figma’s support of real-time collaboration with multiple designers brainstorming and working on the same design.”  </p><figure></figure><p>Lan and Crosby introduced Figma to the rest of the team. In less than no time, Zoom’s designers started recognizing the power and efficiency of getting feedback in context, something previously fragmented in the use of their many previous tools. </p><p>“If you wanted to share a design that was in Sketch, you would take a screenshot and send it out, but at that point, it’s out of context,” says Lan. “A screenshot doesn’t tell you the overall design flow or how a specification fits into the flow. If you don&#39;t understand the context, the feedback you&#39;re providing can be very limited.”</p><p>Figma leverages the ability for anyone to comment in the same design document—requiring no downloads, syncing, or sharing of static files. “It really makes the overall process much smoother and richer than just providing verbal feedback,” Lan adds.</p><div><blockquote><p>Figma really brings together different parts of the team, and not just designers, but also project managers, product managers and engineers. The amount and quality of feedback is ten times better than before.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="a-better-design-system"><a href="#a-better-design-system">A better design system</a></h2><p>With Figma acting as the team’s single source of truth, it was easy for the Zoom designers to start building the foundation for their design system. Although early in the process, Figma Team Libraries enable Zoom designers to share components across projects and ultimately streamline their workflow. Because it is available online, it is shared across all designers - no matter their location or time zone. </p><p>“I love the libraries, components, and live updates,” says Crosby. “We’ve already created an icon set and every component you can imagine. Our master file is pretty much fully componentized and is constantly getting updated.” </p><p>With features like constraints in Figma, Zoom designers can build more consistency into Zoom design patterns. “We’ve been building smart components that scale while elements stay pinned—left, right, top, or bottom,” says Crosby. “I really have a better understanding of building proper components since we’ve been using Figma.”</p><figure></figure><h2 id="brainstorm-sessions"><a href="#brainstorm-sessions">Brainstorm Sessions</a></h2><p>Zoom designers aren’t the only ones finding it easy to use Figma. On a recent project, the designers brought together people from Zoom’s data science team and a design partner from their investment company to brainstorm messages within the product to help Zoom customers feel more engaged.</p><p>The data science team and the design partner had never used Figma before, but that didn’t stop them from being able to brainstorm and put their ideas into a design to share with the group. “We shared the Figma link with them and invited them into the design file,” says Lan. “We had everyone just grab a corner and started brainstorming on their own ideas. You could easily look at what others were doing and play off that idea.” </p><p>Lan recalls that even the non-designers very quickly started moving elements around, changing messages, “borrowing” design elements from others, and more. “There was almost no learning curve” says Lan. “Anyone can jump in and start collaborating.”</p><div><blockquote><p>Design is a team sport, brainstorming with others in Figma stimulates so much more creativity because you can proactively and simultaneously build ideas with other collaborators. When you see cursors darting across the canvas, it’s fun and engaging.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="delivering-happiness-for-everyone"><a href="#delivering-happiness-for-everyone">Delivering happiness for everyone</a></h2><p>After overcoming a major design workflow obstacle and significantly improving transparency and accessibility across the design process, Zoom can better scale its design process as the company grows. “We now have one central point of design collaboration without having to download and install new software each time we add an engineer to a project or grant new access rights for each new file so that individual engineers can see it,” says Lan. “Working with our old tools simply wasn’t scalable as we continue to grow.” </p><p>Given its triple-digit revenue growth, scalability continues being increasingly important for Zoom. Zoom’s designers never lose sight of the company’s mission and culture: delivering happiness for everyone. Everyday on every project, Figma continues to contribute to the happiness of Zoom’s designers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>5 ways to structure your workflow with Pages in Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/five-ways-to-structure-your-workflow-with-pages-in-figma/</link>
      <description>With Pages, you can subdivide your design file into separate tabs, to organize your work in the way that makes most sense for you, whether you’re building a design system, making an app or freelancing.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Designers are constantly on the search for the perfect workflow, so they can spend less time organizing and more time designing. Alas, there’s no one path to design-lightenment. Every company, team and individual has unique needs, which is why we made Figma as flexible as possible.</p><p>We introduced Pages last year to add to that adaptability. With Pages, you can subdivide your design file into separate tabs on the left hand side, to organize your work in the way that makes most sense for you, whether you’re building a design system, making an app or freelancing for others.</p><p>There’s a lot of different ways to set up your files, so we asked people to share their own approach. Take a look for some process inspiration.</p><h2 id="_1-platform-or-screen-size"><a href="#_1-platform-or-screen-size">1. Platform or screen size</a></h2><p>When you’re working on a product that’s cross-platform or responsive — i.e. it’s an Android, iOS and Desktop app — use Pages to separate your designs. That way, you can build your designs responsively using Figma’s frame presets and constraints. Each Page holds its own prototype, which makes it easy to run user tests for different platforms or screen sizes.</p><h2 id="_2-by-feature-in-the-app"><a href="#_2-by-feature-in-the-app">2. By feature in the app</a></h2><p>If you’re working on a team with multiple designers and building an app with a lot of features, organize the sections of the product by Pages. That will allow you to work independently on a feature while still referencing the project as a whole. For example, one designer building the profile view of an app can easily check on what’s happening with the home screen design to stay consistent. You can test the flow for unique parts of the app by making a different prototype on each Page.</p><h2 id="_3-stage-of-the-design-process"><a href="#_3-stage-of-the-design-process">3. Stage of the design process</a></h2><p>If you organize your Pages based on stage of the design process, other stakeholders can see how the work is progressing. Put finished designs on a Page labelled “Done,” and developers will know what they should be building (versus what you’re still tweaking). Stick early ideations and brainstorms on a different Page, so your polished work stays clean.</p><p><strong>Some possible Page structures:</strong></p><ul><li>Thumbnail, wireframes, designs, archive — from <a href="https://twitter.com/cameronmcnab/status/1055936055063412736">Cameron McNab</a></li><li>Docs (reference materials, journey maps, other research), staging (where the messy work is done) and ready for review — from <a href="https://twitter.com/McveyNick/status/1055925897650331648">Nick McVey</a></li><li>Sitemap, wireframes, mockups, QA, screenshots for marketing — from <a href="https://twitter.com/robsonm_design/status/1055922966330957824">Michael Robson</a></li></ul><p>Or, go for pure simplicity:</p><h2 id="_4-atomic-design-method"><a href="#_4-atomic-design-method">4. Atomic design method</a></h2><p>Already using the atomic design method for your design system? Put each building block of your design onto its own Page — atoms (typography or icons) in one, molecules (buttons) in another and organisms (full pages) in a third.</p><p>When you name the Pages that way, you can find any “button” you need when searching your Team Library, because they’ll all show up under the Page labelled button. That simplifies your layer panel. For example, you won’t need to name each individual component or instance “button-selected” or “button-hovered,” you can just name it “selected” or “hovered.”</p><h2 id="_5-the-kitchen-sink-approach"><a href="#_5-the-kitchen-sink-approach">5. The kitchen sink approach</a></h2><p>Want the best of all worlds? You can change your approach to organizing Pages depending on the project you’re working on. Perhaps your overall design system can be captured in one file via the atomic method, and a particular app you’re designing could have its own file organized by OS Pages. Why not mix ‘n match to suit your needs?</p><p>And that’s a wrap for our Pages roundup! Did we miss any major use cases? Do you have a unique spin on how you organize your Figma files? Give us a peek into your process over <a href="https://spectrum.chat/figma">on Spectrum</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Using constraints &amp; “magic numbers” to build responsive layouts in Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/creating-responsive-layout-templates-in-figma/</link>
      <description>Templates with responsive layouts played a key role in scaling our work. Here’s how we figured out the approach that worked for us in both Figma and React.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This post is part of a series: <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/building-a-design-system-with-figma-at-littlebits-17edff8f4236">Building a design system with Figma at littleBits</a>.

We knew we needed a strong design system to do it right, particularly given our small team and short time span (6 months).</p><p>Templates with responsive layouts played a key role in scaling our work. Here’s how we figured out the approach that worked for us in both Figma and React.</p><h2 id="magic-number"><a href="#magic-number">Magic Number</a></h2><p>One thing that’s great to have at the heart of a design system is a ‘magic number’ — it helps harmonize layout if sizes of text, graphic elements, margins, and padding, share a common numeric factor.</p><p>Before we had any kind of system, we had mocks of several key screens that had been created to establish the visual direction of the app.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d214007f17c27a68a1eb161eae7293471cf66bd2-1000x273.png?w=670&amp;h=183&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d214007f17c27a68a1eb161eae7293471cf66bd2-1000x273.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d214007f17c27a68a1eb161eae7293471cf66bd2-1000x273.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d214007f17c27a68a1eb161eae7293471cf66bd2-1000x273.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d214007f17c27a68a1eb161eae7293471cf66bd2-1000x273.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Initial ‘eyeballed’ design mock compared with eventual design using layout based off 8&#39;s</figcaption></figure><p>We looked at the sizes and padding that had been ‘eyeballed’ in these designs, and found that things were mostly working off 8’s — buttons were 48px high, margins were mostly 24px, some headings were 32px, etc.</p><p>Everything was close enough to nudge towards numbers that multiplied from 8 (and 8 in itself is a number that multiplies and divides well!).

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s November, which means Figma is 2-ish years old. In our now annual tradition, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on where we’ve come and where we’re headed. We launched to the public at the end of <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/multiplayer-editing-in-figma/">September in 2016</a>, so that’s our official birthday 😉.</p><p>In 2018, our work is not just about Figma anymore — it’s about our community. From <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-platform/">launching our platform</a> to <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/multiplayer-irl/">hosting meetups in 17 countries</a>, we spent the past year connecting with the wider world. People are building their own businesses on top of our API, and massive organizations are adopting Figma across departments and teams. (For one recent example, check out how <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/https-blog-figma-com-microsoft-automates-design-handoff-with-figmas-api/">Microsoft used our platform</a> to automate developer handoff.) We also raised <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-01/startups-try-to-chip-away-at-adobe-s-dominance">our $25 million Series B</a> at the start of the year, which fueled our product and business expansion in big ways.</p><p>If you didn’t have the time to read all the <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/">blog posts</a> and <a href="https://figmareleases.blogspot.com/">release notes</a> we shared, now’s your chance to play catch up.</p><h2 id="platform"><a href="#platform">Platform</a></h2><p>From Figma’s beginning, we placed our bet on the web. As design grew in importance, we knew how crucial it would be for design tooling to be open and accessible. But we had a lot of naysayers in the early days — people didn’t believe that a cloud-based design tool could (or should) be done.</p><p>So, I took personal satisfaction in <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-platform/">the launch of our platform</a>, which seemed to change the naysayers’ minds. We introduced the first ever web API for a design tool, and before it even launched to the public companies like Uber and GitHub were using it to customize their workflows. They harnessed our platform’s online nature to build creative integrations that wouldn’t have been possible with siloed desktop software.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/712400703fb0984f2a90c2008fe3867199bc3219-800x568.png?rect=0,0,799,568&amp;w=670&amp;h=476&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/712400703fb0984f2a90c2008fe3867199bc3219-800x568.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/712400703fb0984f2a90c2008fe3867199bc3219-800x568.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/712400703fb0984f2a90c2008fe3867199bc3219-800x568.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/712400703fb0984f2a90c2008fe3867199bc3219-800x568.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Now, 7 months after our platform’s launch, we’re seeing <a href="https://relayforfigma.com/">actual businesses</a> — like the kind people charge for — created on our platform, which is exciting.

(Given the conversations we’ve been having, it’s already shaping up to be another big year for the Figma Platform.)</p><p>Fitting with our open platform theme, global community played a major part at Figma this year.</p><p>We spent a lot of time helping Figma users connect with each other, at first by hosting <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/stories/what-we-learned-from-hosting-eight-design-system-meetups/">design system themed meetups</a> in 8 cities around the world. From Bengaluru to Toronto, local designers came together to talk through the nitty-gritty details of systematic design. A few months later, we launched <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/">DesignSystems.com</a>, featuring lessons and stories from community members at <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/stories/airbnb-designer-shares-pro-tips-for-maintaining-a-design-system/">Airbnb</a>, <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/stories/design-systems-will-not-replace-designers/">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/stories/design-systems-will-not-replace-designers/">Braintree</a>, <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/stories/convince-your-company-its-ready-for-a-design-system/">Segment</a> and others.</p><p>There was so much interest in these early initiatives that we decided to double down on in-person connections. We <a href="https://blog.figma.com/multiplayer-irl-fa7e19368776">introduced Figma Local Communities around the world</a>, hiring 3 design advocates to help evangelists organize meetups in their areas. We piloted the program in Africa, with 21 ambassadors in 11 cities and 7 countries throwing 25+ meetups with an online Slack group of over 2,000.</p><p>In the last few months, we <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/figma">expanded to new places</a>, helping local designers host events in Berlin, Manila, London, New York, Stockholm, Seattle, Copenhagen and countless other cities. We’ve hit the capacity limit on all of these, with 100–300+ people RSVPing for each. Product design is at an inflection point and designers are hungry for IRL opportunities to connect.</p><p>Want to plan a meetup in your city? <a href="https://www.figma.com/community">Reach out to us here</a>.</p><h2 id="this-year-s-big-product-news"><a href="#this-year-s-big-product-news">This year’s big product news</a></h2><p>Although we spent a lot of time in 2018 focused outward, we used what we learned to inform our internal roadmap. We refined, tweaked, honed and perfected the tool, making Figma faster (roughly 3x!). We shipped Styles, big advancements to Prototyping, and more.</p><p>As always, our community played a big role in guiding and inspiring our product development, so <a href="https://spectrum.chat/figma">keep your ideas coming</a>!</p><h2 id="performance"><a href="#performance">Performance</a></h2><p>Much like quality, performance is an ongoing focus at Figma. We had <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-faster-d1947f9c26ca">a couple major wins this year</a>, by restructuring our document renderer and fixing bugs in WebAssembly. These projects helped make screen loading, zooming and dragging up to 3x faster in dense documents. We’ll have more big performance news coming in 2019.</p><figure><figcaption>Screen loading in a dense document before and after performance work</figcaption></figure><h2 id="prototyping"><a href="#prototyping">Prototyping</a></h2><p>We learned <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-2-0-now-with-prototyping-and-developer-handoff-1b309a5d025c">with Figma 2.0 </a>— the launch of Developer Handoff and basic Prototyping — that people really did want an all-in-one tool. So we spent 2018 expanding that functionality, <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-3-0-217d6c248f85">starting with our 3.0 launch</a> and <a href="https://blog.figma.com/the-finale-of-prototyping-week-interactions-e30182a8ff8e">continuing months later with our Prototyping Week</a>.</p><h4 id="all-in-all-we-introduced"><a href="#all-in-all-we-introduced">All in all, we introduced:</a></h4><ul><li><a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-3-0-217d6c248f85">Device frames</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-3-0-217d6c248f85">Fixed objects</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-3-0-217d6c248f85">Advanced scrolling</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-prototyping-now-with-transitions-197f817ae7a8">Transitions</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.figma.com/the-finale-of-prototyping-week-interactions-e30182a8ff8e">Interactions for user behavior like hovering or button pressing</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1031942881622147072">Clickable URLs</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1032300523729301504">Back transitions</a></li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/1034108389725556736">Hotspots for mobile prototypes</a></li></ul><p>These additions made it possible for most people to move all their design and prototyping to Figma. (For those who need even more advanced animations, <a href="https://blog.figma.com/animate-your-figma-designs-with-our-new-principle-integration-f6f1488d5c0a">we built an integration</a> with beloved prototyping tool Principle.)</p><figure><figcaption>Advanced scrolling in action</figcaption></figure><h2 id="styles"><a href="#styles">Styles</a></h2><p>The other big <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-styles-beta-a-new-way-to-apply-text-and-layer-attributes-1ecde1b0de74">product development this year was Styles</a>. We knew this functionality was important and took our time getting it right, doing a ton of user testing before running a private beta.</p><p>Your feedback shaped the novel approach we took to implementing Styles. Because we’re web-based, teams can integrate their Figma Styles holistically into their design system. With one click, you can update a Style in all designs across a company (with your colleagues having the choice to accept or reject the changes you made).</p><p>Unlike other design tools, in Figma you can apply color Styles separately from text and effect Styles, which makes updating your design system much easier. There’s no need to create a bunch of new Styles every time you change a link color or some other attribute — just update the original attribute and it will propagate through the system. As you’d imagine, this saves a ton of time and makes it easier for big organizations to scale their design systems.</p><p>Fun fact — 42% of active designers now use Styles each week.</p><h2 id="sweating-the-small-stuff"><a href="#sweating-the-small-stuff">Sweating the small stuff</a></h2><p>Although Platform, Styles and Prototyping were the big headlines for Figma in 2018, we sweated the small stuff too. From <a href="https://blog.figma.com/desperately-seeking-squircles-8eb8db9b654b">Squircles</a> to <a href="https://blog.figma.com/our-new-svg-exports-are-short-n-sweet-1b2e2cedf319">SVG Export</a>, the little workflow improvements matter. Here’s a quick recap on what shipped, with insider tips on how to use the new features.</p><h2 id="pages"><a href="#pages">Pages</a></h2><p>We <a href="https://blog.figma.com/introducing-figma-pages-1363000e6079">introduced Pages</a> as another form of organization for people’s files via the left hand layers panel.</p><p><em>One pro tip:</em> Use Pages with Prototypes to present polished final work to other stakeholders and keep your messier design explorations separate. Once you’re ready to share your design, create a new Page in your file and make a Prototype with a subset of your design. When you share the Prototype link with someone else, it will only play what’s currently selected.</p><h2 id="mentions"><a href="#mentions">@mentions</a></h2><p>It might seem crazy to imagine a world where Figma didn’t have @mentions but… <a href="https://blog.figma.com/with-love-from-figma-mentions-and-file-sorting-e0110a18181e">we introduced it less than a year ago</a>! As Figma becomes a hub for your design team’s process — as well as your design team’s files — collaboration functionality like this becomes more and more important.</p><h2 id="name-and-annotate-version-history"><a href="#name-and-annotate-version-history">Name and annotate version history</a></h2><p><a href="https://blog.figma.com/now-you-can-name-and-annotate-your-figma-version-history-250aa1b5caf5">With our naming feature</a>, you can flag certain versions for yourself and leave notes to track how things changed over time.

We put one Figma engineer to the task of mastering Apple’s famous, mathematically quirky circle-square corner. It turned out to <a href="https://blog.figma.com/desperately-seeking-squircles-8eb8db9b654b">be a bigger odyssey</a> than we expected — he spent a full month buried in pages of math to try to get the Squircle right in Figma. You can read the full tale of our efforts here and use Squircles in your design by <a href="https://help.figma.com/faqs/how-do-i-round-corners">following these instructions</a>.</p><h2 id="scrubbable-inputs"><a href="#scrubbable-inputs">Scrubbable inputs</a></h2><p>This one’s fun. With the keyboard shortcuts Opt + click + drag, <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/917448148385013760">you can easily scrub through property values</a>. Click an object, then hover over the input on the right hand properties panel. This should make changing the position and dimension of an object much faster, among other things.</p><p>Fun fact: When you’re in Chrome, you can wrap your cursor around the canvas to scrub even faster.</p><h2 id="quality-weeks"><a href="#quality-weeks">Quality Weeks</a></h2><p>Like always, we held our <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-quality-week-inside-our-bug-bashing-party-1c1ddfa72e0d">bi-annual Quality Weeks at Figma</a>, where the design and engineering teams stop whatever they’re doing and buckle down to bash bugs and tackle tricky problems. We give out fun internal prizes to those who crush bugs like “Most WTF” and “Oldest.” That said, we’re constantly bug bashing at Figma, so every week is a quality week.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b5eb5b0b4b8157879c633662462cad2320aca8fd-800x600.jpg?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b5eb5b0b4b8157879c633662462cad2320aca8fd-800x600.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b5eb5b0b4b8157879c633662462cad2320aca8fd-800x600.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b5eb5b0b4b8157879c633662462cad2320aca8fd-800x600.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b5eb5b0b4b8157879c633662462cad2320aca8fd-800x600.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="reducing-svg-export"><a href="#reducing-svg-export">Reducing SVG Export</a></h2><p>Yes, we know, our SVG Export used to produce novels. Our users made it clear we needed a simpler approach, so <a href="https://blog.figma.com/our-new-svg-exports-are-short-n-sweet-1b2e2cedf319">we converted our SVG Exports to a more compact version</a> that can easily be read by other tools (like Android Studio).</p><h2 id="design-systems"><a href="#design-systems">Design Systems</a></h2><p>Aside from Styles, this year we introduced two other features to help organizations build design systems — <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/918870667814060032">nested instance swapping</a> and <a href="https://blog.figma.com/advanced-project-permissions-for-design-systems-9e6825bccdf4">advanced project permissions</a>. As many of you know, nested instance swapping is crucial for systematic design. By replacing an instance that’s nested inside a component with an alternate instance, designers can customize parts of their work. For example, a designer might use instance swapping to show different states of a button after a user interaction (hovering versus clicking) without detaching that button component from the larger design system.</p><p>With advanced project permissions, organizations have finer grained control over file sharing in Figma. Designers can designate a file “view only” or “invite only.” That’s a boon for people building design systems for their companies, because they can block others from changing master components while still letting them see the file and use its components in their own designs.</p><h2 id="expansion-of-support"><a href="#expansion-of-support">Expansion of support</a></h2><p>We see customer support as a key part of the Figma experience, so we grew our support team from 3 to 7 this year and we’re still growing. We’ve had over 11,500 conversations with our users so far this year (that’s a whopping 38% increase from 2017), wrote over a <a href="https://help.figma.com/">dozen new help articles</a>, created over <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQsVmhSa4X-G3lHlUtejzLA">20 new YouTube tutorial videos</a> and just migrated to a new support tool to make sure the customer experience is even better for 2019.</p><p>If you ever run into issues with the product, <a href="https://www.figma.com/contact/">please don’t hesitate to reach out to us</a> — we’re committed to understanding your feedback and fixing issues quickly.</p><h2 id="organization-beta"><a href="#organization-beta">Organization Beta</a></h2><p>Lastly, in 2018 we laid the foundation of our ‘Organization’ tier with functionality for enterprise companies. We’re talking sexy security stuff, fine-toothed control over team structures, expanded administrative dashboards and functionality for org-wide design systems! We’ve had a bunch of companies on our private beta over the past 6 months, and we’re excited to open this up to everyone in 2019.</p><h2 id="on-to-the-next"><a href="#on-to-the-next">On to the next</a></h2><p>And that wraps it up for the 2018 roundup! Our users have always played a huge role in shaping Figma, and we loved getting to meet so many of you in person this year.</p><p>Your ideas and engagement make Figma what it is, so as always, keep the feedback coming <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign">on Twitter</a>, <a href="https://spectrum.chat/figma">Spectrum</a> and <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Figma-SF/">in person</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Designers use Figma to bring Uber to the unbanked</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/designers-use-figma-to-bring-uber-to-the-unbanked/</link>
      <description>“Figma is like a tidy bookshelf, where you can find exactly what you need, whenever you need it.”</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Very few companies become verbs in the popular lexicon, as in “Google it.” It takes a unique approach to user experience combined with a strong desire to disrupt the status quo. Before Uber, no one imagined peer-to-peer transportation at the push of a button, but now it’s common to hear “Did you Uber here?”</p><p>Uber may have started as a simple idea, but it’s become a global logistics giant. It powers 4 billion trips each year taken by 75 million riders in 65 countries around the world. How did it transform the transportation industry in dozens of different markets around the globe? Uber excels at designing experiences that work for anyone, anywhere.</p><h2 id="how-do-you-say-uber-in-portuguese"><a href="#how-do-you-say-uber-in-portuguese">How do you say Uber in Portuguese?</a></h2><p>To attract users around the world, Uber crafts simple, practical experiences for both riders and drivers. Femke van Schoonhoven is a product designer at Uber in Amsterdam and is responsible for building elegant user interface designs that shape the way people pay or get paid for rides on Uber.</p><p>“We design for the masses and that means considering everything about the user and how they interact with the products in different parts of the world,” says van Schoonhoven. Particularly in emerging markets, this means that Uber product designers need to consider:</p><ul><li>Language</li><li>Literacy</li><li>Device</li><li>Culture</li><li>Location</li><li>Role</li></ul><p>As a company, Uber insists that product teams conduct deep research before creating solutions to address user needs and problems. For van Schoonhoven and the team, this includes on-the-ground research to learn about the characteristics and nuances of local markets and the people who live there. One aspect of the research focuses on riding along with drivers in other countries to test new designs for user experiences.</p><p>Learn more about Uber’s design practices for emerging markets in this <a href="https://vimeo.com/269041830/634a161de6">video presentation</a> at Ladies that UX.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4abcd817bf84f03e43df86155c7d034184486043-800x419.png?w=670&amp;h=351&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4abcd817bf84f03e43df86155c7d034184486043-800x419.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4abcd817bf84f03e43df86155c7d034184486043-800x419.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4abcd817bf84f03e43df86155c7d034184486043-800x419.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4abcd817bf84f03e43df86155c7d034184486043-800x419.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Image from www.uber.design/team</figcaption></figure><h2 id="designing-for-cash-payments-in-emerging-markets"><a href="#designing-for-cash-payments-in-emerging-markets">Designing for cash payments in emerging markets</a></h2><p>When van Schoonhoven started working at Uber, the company had already started introducing cash as a payment method in some markets. She joined a team of product managers, designers, product operations, data scientists and engineers — all focused on continuing to invent and iterate features and user experiences that bring cash as a form of payment to more markets around the world.</p><p>The Cash team was using a design tool that was not well suited for the project, which meant that the typical design workflow involved inefficient import and export of files and communication outside of the tool for status updates. To finish a single design, Van Schoonhoven had to work in several different tools for designing, prototyping, sharing, and collecting feedback before handing off to engineering.</p><p>The team hit its design software breaking point during a frustrating research trip.</p><p>“We were testing prototypes with Uber drivers and the plan was to iterate in real time based on their immediate feedback,” says van Schoonhoven. “It was so painful to do this because we could only have one person at a time make changes to the file while the other had to wait. There was no way to work collaboratively on the same design at the same time. We thought ‘there must be a better way.’”</p><h2 id="collaborating-on-any-design-anywhere-anytime"><a href="#collaborating-on-any-design-anywhere-anytime">Collaborating on any design, anywhere, anytime</a></h2><p>Back in Amsterdam, van Schoonhoven was determined to find a solution to the collaboration problem. She heard that other teams within Uber were early adopters of Figma, a collaborative, web-based design tool, and decided to try it out.</p><p>By simply dragging and dropping existing design files into Figma, van Schoonhoven was soon working in the new software, enhancing and creating designs using local languages and actual, in-context material. “The transition was extremely seamless,” says van Schoonhoven.</p><p>Now nearly everything van Schoonhoven does is in Figma. She can collaborate in real time on the same design with other team members, locally or anywhere in the world. And she finds organizing files in Figma more intuitive.</p><div><blockquote><p>Figma is like a tidy bookshelf, where you can find exactly what you need, whenever you need it.</p></blockquote></div><figure><figcaption>Prototype for Uber India</figcaption></figure><h2 id="cutting-through-the-noise-with-a-single-source-of"><a href="#cutting-through-the-noise-with-a-single-source-of">Cutting through the noise with a single source of truth</a></h2><p>Easy collaboration and organization aren’t the only benefits van Schoonhoven appreciates. She reports that communication is much more efficient with Figma because it can take place directly within a design file.</p><p>“Before, I would constantly be sending emails to project stakeholders with updates about the latest version of the design,” she says. “With Figma, my team members can go into the folder any time they want and see the latest designs. No one has to ping me about the latest status or go back-and-forth with me via emails to clarify which design is the latest version. Figma has reduced communication overhead by at least 75 percent.”</p><p>Perhaps most impactful is the collaboration with engineers. “Making sure engineers had the latest design was a real struggle before,” says van Schoonhoven. “Now engineers are invited to the file in Figma so they can see the latest changes with comments in context.” Because van Schoonhoven can bring engineers into the design process early, handoff is simpler and faster.</p><p>Her favorite thing about Figma? It makes her feel like part of the team, even though the group is large and distributed across multiple locations. “Our work was very siloed before,” she says. “Figma is now our central design depository, which lets us all work together on a common goal. It’s had the biggest impact on my work.”</p><div><blockquote><p>“Because Figma is web-based, it’s easy for stakeholders to share files and quickly get buyoffs on designs at the next level — and that means we can move faster as a team.”</p></blockquote></div><figure><figcaption>Prototype for Uber India</figcaption></figure><h2 id="starting-new-collaborative-projects-in-figma"><a href="#starting-new-collaborative-projects-in-figma">Starting new collaborative projects in Figma</a></h2><p>The Cash team strives to be involved as much as possible in the new work that comes from Uber headquarters. For a new project where van Schoonhoven is working with a designer in San Francisco, Figma is providing the collaborative foundation.</p><p>“It’s really helpful to have access to the latest Uber platform components in Figma so that I can add the most recent user interface changes to my designs,” she says. “Before, I would have to search or ask about which version was the latest. Now, I can start by dragging and dropping the correct components.”</p><p>Figma provides the level of collaboration that van Schoonhoven envisioned back when she was conducting field research. “With Figma, we can work at the same time in the same file while still being respectful of each other’s designs,” she says. “I can’t wait to use it for user testing and research, where we can collaborate, iterate and prototype while we’re in a car on the road.”</p><div><blockquote><p>Because design is more visible and transparent, it’s easier for all of us to think more globally.</p></blockquote></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Animate your Figma designs with our new Principle integration</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/animate-your-figma-designs-with-our-new-principle-integration/</link>
      <description>Figma now integrates with the prototyping tool Principle</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we have some special news that’s been months…perhaps years…in the making. <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma now integrates</a> with the <a href="https://principleformac.com/">prototyping tool Principle</a>, so you can easily build advanced animations of your Figma designs. Yes, we know, you’re <em>really excited</em>. We are too — we’ve admired Principle since it first launched in 2015. Your requests for an integration — whether in the most upvoted comment on Principle’s <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/principle-for-mac-4-0">latest Product Hunt launch</a>, or in <a href="https://twitter.com/jackhone/status/1030574034583347201">constant tweets</a> to us — didn’t go unnoticed.</p><p>With this new integration, import your designs from Figma, then use motion in Principle to bring them to life. Add scrolling to your pages or swiping between image cards. Give buttons different states based on how people interact with them. Play with animation between objects like spring, ease in, ease out or linear transitions. In short, add all the functionality to make your static designs feel like an actual mobile app.</p><p>You’ll soon see why Principle inspires fanatic obsession in its users. It strikes the perfect balance between simplicity and power, giving people everything they need to create realistic prototypes, without having to learn to code.</p><p><em>“Even if you’re a person who knows both design and engineering, your brain operates very differently in each state,” Daniel Hooper, Principle’s creator, said. “Putting people in the technical engineering mindset suppresses their innate visual creative skills.”</em></p><figure><figcaption>Figma and Principle in action</figcaption></figure><p>You can do everything in Principle using its straightforward visual UI, which will feel familiar for interface designers. Enable the Figma-Principle integration by opening Principle, clicking import and authorizing Figma as a source.</p><p>If you need to tweak your Figma design after you already imported it to Principle, it’s easy to sync between the two tools. Principle will automatically recognize changes you make in Figma and merge them. Make a button bigger in Figma? The button will automatically resize in Principle, while keeping the same animations you originally set for it.</p><p>The integration was built using Figma’s web-based API, and Daniel spent a lot of time exploring our documentation and tools there. “The API explorer on the developer page is really useful,” Daniel said. “It’s a convenient way to get a handle on how it works.”</p><p>With the API Explorer, developers can put in the ID of a specific Figma file to see how the API will ultimately call it. That way, they can test the building blocks of the Figma API and understand its functionality. “It’s a very web thing,” Daniel added.</p><p>Principle itself is intuitive to use, even for beginners. To see for yourself, <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/geLBZZIEh7TxDLzZ2TTSts2F/Figma-Principle-integration-Final?node-id=0%3A1">play with the first Figma file</a> ever imported to Principle. Download Principle and import the file to get started.</p><p>Let us know what you think of the new functionality <a href="https://spectrum.chat/figma">over on Spectrum</a>!</p><figure><figcaption>The first Figma file animated in Principle</figcaption></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Google’s AR Design Guidelines suffice while Apple’s fall short</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/googles-ar-design-guidelines-suffice-while-apples-fall-short/</link>
      <description>A vision for how they could evolve</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The 3D industry hit a huge turning point last summer when Google and Apple introduced mobile augmented reality (AR) platforms. In a matter of weeks, the center of gravity for 3D UX design shifted to mobile.</p><p>For the first time, anyone familiar with mobile app development could build immersive 3D experiences, with the potential to reach half a billion Android and iOS users (instead of just a small pool of VR headset owners). These platforms — ARCore from Google and ARKit from Apple — democratized 3D design for the masses.</p><p>But enthusiasm quickly gave way to more practical concerns:</p><ol><li>What tools and documentation were available to facilitate the embrace of 3D?</li><li>How could mobile app designers and developers, accustomed to mature tools that formed (mostly) integrated workflows, begin to design for 3D? Not only did they need to learn the important <a href="https://www.torch.app/blog/a-3d-primer-for-screen-designers">differences between designing for 2D and 3D</a>, but they also had to wade through the hodgepodge of tools and <a href="https://www.torch.app/pain">byzantine workflows</a> borrowed from gaming, video/film entertainment, architecture and engineering disciplines.</li></ol><p>To answer designers’ first concern, both Apple and Google quickly released augmented reality design guidelines. Apple’s guidelines are the more modest of the two in terms of both content and ambition. These appear under the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/system-capabilities/augmented-reality/">Augmented Reality entry</a> in their Human Interface Guidelines. Google’s Augmented Reality Design Guidelines (GARDG) caught our attention for its greater breadth of topics, which seem to draw from their inspiration from Google’s real-life experience designing and building apps like <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.vr.apps.ornament&amp;hl=en_US">AR Stickers</a> and Just a Line.</p><p>But both guidelines ultimately fall short when confronting the complexity and ambition expressed by many designers. Apple and Google limit their focus to simple, single scene applications and make no allowance for complex mechanics — or really anything behind simple object placement and sticker-like functionality.</p><p>This doesn’t meet the needs of anyone building apps that include interactivity like:</p><ul><li>Object selection</li><li>Conditional behaviors</li><li>Branching scene flows or storyboards driven off of user behavior</li><li>Movement between scenes using teleportation</li><li>Portals</li><li>Physical gestures</li></ul><p>Both sets of guidelines lack any mention of multi-scene use cases, which automatically excludes many modes of interactivity or conditional behavior that leads to transitions, complex or more interesting changes of state, personalization, and ultimately a deeper, more immersive experience.</p><p>Similarly, there is no discussion of animations (a common topic in our interviews with designers), either triggered or timed, or the notion of a shared or collaborative environment. The latter example is one we frequently encounter. Designers want to allow remote collaborators and clients to see their AR prototypes in the environment for which they were intended, and to provide feedback, all in real time.</p><p>Even in the relatively tame realm of static object creation and placement, designers are already searching for the best way to design for complex behaviors, such as selecting objects that might be hidden by other objects.</p><p>That said, when it comes to object placement (the most basic interaction in AR), the Google guidelines make assumptions about optimal object placement range — within the reach of the user — that we see no reason to codify at this time. What about throwing objects as a method of placement, or pointing, grabbing and interacting with objects at a distance?</p><p>However, compared to Apple’s guidelines, which cover object placement only in relation to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZnG9wrVxtM">ARkit surface plane detection</a>, Google’s treatment looks exhaustive. Not only are there sections covering “tap to place,” “drag to place,” and “free placement” methods, Google also includes a section on creating a sense of realism that briefly touches on the use of physics in object placement.</p><figure></figure><p>Despite what it’s missing, Google’s Augmented Reality Design Guidelines (GARDG) is a good starting point, with more practical advice and a more pragmatic layout. Since they launched it in the summer, there’s been a lot of new additions, like an excellent new section on <a href="https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/ar-design/designing-the-experience/ui-components.html#">UI components</a>. Meanwhile, a section entitled <a href="https://designguidelines.withgoogle.com/ar-design/designing-the-experience/experience.html">Designing the Experience</a> covers practical concerns like onboarding.</p><p>With its ongoing evolution, we can reasonably expect the guidelines to grow to reflect many of the areas of interest we’ve heard expressed. In the meantime, designers can fill in the gaps left by Google and Apple. We have the opportunity to shape best practices for 3D UX ourselves, and a few industry leaders have already started doing so. For instance, Bushra Mahmood, a designer currently with Unity, took the initiative to develop her own extensive design guidelines (well worth a look, <a href="https://medium.com/@goatsandbacon/a-quick-guide-to-designing-for-augmented-reality-on-mobile-part-1-c8ecaaf303d5">here</a>), while teams, like one at <a href="https://uxplanet.org/design-challenge-rapid-prototyping-a-functioning-augmented-reality-app-fb73ede33a4e">Marino Software</a>, are bootstrapping entire new processes with a mishmash of existing tools.</p><p>This kind of grassroots work is crucial, because Apple’s and Google’s guidelines will never keep up with millions of creative people experimenting and innovating. By the time headsets are widely available, the distinction between 2D and 3D UX design will have been permanently erased.</p><p>By offering little in the way of resources, Apple and Google are holding the door wide open for anyone who wants to lead the way. Maybe that was the plan all along?</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="ExVFOBMuC_Uv" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><h3 id="about-the-author"><a href="#about-the-author">About the Author</a></h3><p>Paul Reynolds has been a software developer and technology consultant since 1997.

      <title>Introducing Smart Selection</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-smart-selection/</link>
      <description>We&#39;d like to help you speed up your explorations</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a designer a large part of our work is about exploring constraints and possibilities, which is often a very iterative process. We try this, we try that, we document our findings, and we revisit what we did yesterday.</p><p>Most of this work involves repetitive tasks, like “What if the spacing around the icons was a little bit tighter?” or “Would it help to move these things around?”</p><p>This tedious work can take up a huge amount of time. Simply increasing the height of some elements of a list might mean performing 10 resize operations, 9 move operations — all while keeping track of spacing and alignment in your head.</p><p>It shouldn’t have to be this hard. After all, we have these amazingly powerful computers at our disposal, where one of the fundamental aspects is effective <em>repetition and reuse</em>. I.e. a computer is able to perfectly repeat the same action multiple times at blazing speeds, something utilized by writing professionals, software engineers, data researchers and others. But not as much by designers.</p><p>Today we are excited to introduce a novel new feature that is going to relieve this repetitive “monkey work” for designers and speed up your explorations.</p><figure></figure><p>We call it Smart Selection — it helps you adjust spacing and arrangement of multiple items in a selection of objects on the canvas with ease, among other things. Think of it as a power-up. It gives you the freedom to focus on the essentials of your creative process, rather than the minutiae.</p><h2 id="how-smart-selection-works"><a href="#how-smart-selection-works">How Smart Selection works</a></h2><p>Smart Selection works automatically on any selection or group of three or more items with equal, uniform spacing. With items selected, you can adjust spacing, position and size of all these items at once.</p><figure></figure><p>Here’s what you can do with Smart Selection:</p><ul><li>Drag the pink-colored handles in the space between objects to adjust spacing of all items.</li><li>Drag the ring to quickly rearrange items.</li><li>Click one or more items’ pink rings to mark them: this allows resizing by pulling on their edges.</li></ul><p>In building this feature, we wanted to find a solution within the paradigms that designers are already working in, rather than introduce a brand new way of thinking.</p><p>With this in mind, we created a way to assist you right on the canvas where you are able to directly manipulate objects, without needing to learn any special new tools or object types. It’s a pure UI feature.</p><h2 id="tidy-up"><a href="#tidy-up">Tidy Up</a></h2><p>Alongside Smart Selection, we’re introducing another great feature called Tidy Up which makes it fantastically easy to get a Smart Selection out of something messier. No need to be precise when playing around — just invoke the Tidy Up action to deftly arrange selected items. Think of it as a “distribute” function that does a better job.</p><figure></figure><p>Tidy Up takes the selected items and shifts them so that they’re both near each other and have the same spacing. The use cases go beyond just assisting with Smart Selection — you’ll find Tidy Up helpful with things like tables and toolbars. Unlike the traditional distribute function, the spacing will always be even.</p><p>To help you visualize how Tidy Up works, imagine working on 20 screens, all constituting one flow. We want these to be neatly arranged with perfect spacing in between, so that when we present this to other stakeholders, it looks refined.</p><figure><figcaption>Left: Manual work. Right: Tidy Up with Smart Selection.</figcaption></figure><p>Doing this in traditional design tools often means manually going through each and every space (19 spaces to measure in our example!) and adjusting the ones that are off.</p><p>With Tidy Up all this can be done in a single quick action — select your screens and then click the Tidy Up button at the top of the right sidebar. The keyboard shortcut for Tidy Up is ⌥⌘T on macOS and ctrl-alt-T on other platforms.</p><h2 id="what-s-next"><a href="#what-s-next">What&#39;s next?</a></h2><p>We’ve got a lot more in store for you in the coming months, including support for 2D grids with Smart Selection and other exciting things.</p><p>As always, we’re eager to hear what you do with Smart Selection and to get your feedback on how we can make it even better. Reach out to us in-app (the question mark button) or on <a href="https://spectrum.chat/figma/feedback">Spectrum</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma&#39;s New Finger Tips</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figmas-new-finger-tips/</link>
      <description>How Doug Engelbart’s famous demo inspired a designer’s lifelong obsession with keyboard shortcuts</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Today we introduced a new way to master keyboard shortcuts: a redesigned panel that shows up at the bottom of your Figma screen. It will respond to your behavior by highlighting patterns in your keyboard use and help you discover new key combinations in a fun way. We’ve taken our inspiration from computing pioneer Douglas Engelbart, and wanted to briefly share how his work shaped our approach. (Read to the end for the deep dive into our new keyboard panel.)</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="er_aBPTpT-zM" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>One Monday afternoon fifty years ago, on a stage by San Francisco’s Civic Center, computer pioneer Douglas Engelbart gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY">a demonstration that forever altered the course of computing</a>.</p><p>At the time, computers were known to serve corporate and government needs: calculations, simulations, payroll. But Engelbart focused on something different: computers that were <em>personal</em> and could help with daily tasks. Collaborating with a few team members thirty miles away, he showed the audience how to write documents together, add graphics to make them better, create links between them and chat while doing it.</p><p>The session received a standing ovation and helped inspire other tech industry leaders. Some of the most significant strides in people-oriented computing that came afterward — like Apple’s first Macintosh — can be traced directly back to this demo.</p><p>But for me, just as important as the events shown on Engelbart’s screen was what was happening with his hands. On a custom-made tray, a traditional QWERTY keyboard was surrounded by two never-before-seen accessories: on the right, a thick box named a “mouse,” and on the left, an unusual one-handed device called a “keyset.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670&amp;h=308&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0454f298e8c5c37efbbf91b4c9dfa0513294a94c-1200x552.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1200w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Doug Engelbart used a mouse in the right hand and a keyset in the left</figcaption></figure><p>The mouse initially stole all the glory, as it felt simple and friendly. But the keyset — a cross between a keyboard and a piano — was just as fascinating. With the mouse, Engelbart could point to things; with the keyset, he could describe what to do with them. At one point, he started aiming at a word with the mouse and then — still on the way there — used his other hand to quietly key in two letters: DW (“delete word”). The word disappeared.</p><p>The alliance between two hands and two devices made Engelbart’s presentation feel like nothing less than magic, the closest to a mind-meld with a machine we’d ever witnessed — or, in words of one of the attendees, like Engelbart was “dealing lightning with both hands.”</p><p>Part of the wonder could be traced to the properties of our motor memory, which allow us to master physical actions to the point they become instinctive and subconscious. If you know a pianist or a dancer, ask them to describe their performance. They will struggle; they internalized their movements so much that they no longer even register as actions. The motor memory allows them to simply play or dance.</p><p>Engelbart applied those same properties of motor memory to computer tasks. By mastering the mouse and the chords on his keyset, he was able to operate the computer with astonishing fluidity — and his prowess with both devices was a significant part of the demo’s impact.</p><h2 id="what-engelbart-s-demo-has-to-do-with-figma"><a href="#what-engelbart-s-demo-has-to-do-with-figma">What Engelbart’s demo has to do with Figma</a></h2><p>I can’t count how many times I’ve watched the Engelbart demo in awe. As a designer, I’ve long been fascinated by the universe of input devices — enough that I’ve decided to write a <a href="https://medium.com/@mwichary/shift-happens-5b049f5a93a8">book about the history of keyboards</a>. So when I joined forces with Figma to help with a few projects, I started thinking about not just the screen, but also the hands underneath it.</p><p>Much like Engelbart’s demo, witnessing someone really good at using Figma will feel like a miracle. They’ll traverse the canvas, restyle objects, and create new designs at a miraculous pace, without ever glancing down at their hands. Just like watching an experienced pianist or dancer, it will almost feel like a performance.</p><p>And all this happens using a setup similar to Engelbart’s: one hand on the mouse, another on the keyboard. It’s still the best combination to free your mind to engage in the state of flow. Let your hands do their job, and instead of thinking of the tool you’re using, think about the problems you want to solve.</p><p>But just as in 1968, one of those devices is much harder to master than the other. The mouse and its successors are easy to grab and use, even by a beginner. However, the long-gone keyset or modern keyboard shortcuts are a different story. They require practice and dedication to first explore and then commit into motor memory.</p><p>So today, we’re adding a small improvement to Figma that might help: a better keyboard shortcut panel. Before now, that part of Figma hadn’t received much love. It was hard to scan and would take over the entire screen — making it hard to learn by actually trying.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/037c41f4bc5da536bde89cbeef2aea82d1469ee0-600x450.png?rect=0,0,599,450&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/037c41f4bc5da536bde89cbeef2aea82d1469ee0-600x450.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/037c41f4bc5da536bde89cbeef2aea82d1469ee0-600x450.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/037c41f4bc5da536bde89cbeef2aea82d1469ee0-600x450.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 599w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The old keyboard panel</figcaption></figure><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82eaca0c5f1dbf8ae395663df8ee0ed709cfd950-600x450.png?rect=0,0,599,450&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82eaca0c5f1dbf8ae395663df8ee0ed709cfd950-600x450.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82eaca0c5f1dbf8ae395663df8ee0ed709cfd950-600x450.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82eaca0c5f1dbf8ae395663df8ee0ed709cfd950-600x450.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 599w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The new keyboard panel</figcaption></figure><p>The new keyboard panel will appear underneath your canvas instead. You can summon it the same way — by clicking the question mark in the bottom right hand corner of your screen and then choosing Keyboard Shortcuts (or pressing <strong>Ctrl+Shift+?</strong>).</p><p>When you open the new panel, you can click through categories to learn new shortcuts specific to the type of work you’re doing. If you’re dealing with vectors, go straight to the shape tab to see a few power shortcuts like bending. If you — like me — usually work with fonts, head to the type section instead.</p><p>We also added a tab for some of the most rewarding combinations — those, just like the famous Engelbart demo, that come from a two-handed effort. For example, did you know holding <strong>Alt</strong> while moving the mouse around allows you to measure objects in Figma with ease?</p><p>And if you feel overwhelmed by all this, there’s one simple tab on the left hand side. It will introduce you to starter key combinations you will never want to live without, like how <strong>⌘+\</strong> takes away all of the “chrome” so you can focus on your work.</p><p>Our hope is that this new setup will make it easier to learn shortcuts and help you discover related shortcuts you never knew existed. By working on this project, I personally discovered and learned how useful <strong>Shift+2</strong> in the Zoom panel can be — it always does just the right thing to make the selection visible.</p><p>We also added one more thing: the panel will actually listen to your fingers, highlight the shortcuts you just pressed, and remember them for the future. We hope this detail will make it easier and more fun to reflect on your use of keyboard with Figma, and notice the shortcuts you never had a chance to try.</p><figure><figcaption>The panel will highlight shortcuts you press and remember them in the future</figcaption></figure><p>And yes, I know it feels a little silly contrasting a small improvement like this with a seminal moment in computing history known as “The Mother Of All Demos.” But even small steps are worth celebrating, particularly if they can give your motor memory a chance to shine. :·)</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="RstqMWhCLsTV" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>*P.S.

      <description>Who can build the best Figma to Sketch exporter?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Update 11/19/18: Given the concerns raised by our community, we decided not to move forward with any version of this challenge for now.</strong></p><p><strong>Update — We’re pressing pause on the challenge and hope to relaunch in the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://blog.figma.com/we-made-a-mistake-with-our-api-challenge-and-were-sorry-1fac492eb523">Read more here.</a></strong></p><p>Today we’re announcing our first Figma API Challenge — with $15K in prizes for the winners — to incentivize our community to create the best possible Figma to Sketch converter.</p><p>That’s right — we want to make it <em>easier</em> for everyone to export their design files straight to our competitor…not harder. It may sound crazy, but Figma is committed to building an open design platform. With this Challenge, we’re putting our money where our mouth is.</p><p>Designers work in many different ways — with an array of stakeholders and clients — and shouldn’t have to worry about switching between tools on projects. We’ve had Sketch import available since we launched, so this is a natural evolution of Figma’s design ecosystem.</p><p>Sketch export is the first Figma API Challenge, where we invite designers and developers to experiment with Figma’s functionality. After seeing <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/want-figma-api-inspiration-heres-8-community-powered-projects/">the amazing things</a> people made with <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-platform/">our read API</a>, we wanted to start rewarding people for open-sourcing what they create with the broader community 💪. Stay tuned for future Challenges.</p><h2 id="details"><a href="#details">Details</a></h2><p>Each submission to the challenge will be evaluated on <a href="https://www.figma.com/figma-api-challenge-2018/">both objective and subjective criteria</a>. Judges will look at how well exporters transfer two files of Figma objects into Sketch:</p><ol><li><strong>1st file</strong> = basic level objects</li><li><strong>2nd file</strong> = type, components, styles, and prototypes</li></ol><p>Although we expect the former to be easier to import — there’s a clear “right” and “wrong” way to do it — the latter file may be trickier. Each of the objects in the second file don’t necessarily have a 1:1 relationship between Figma and Sketch, so the exporters will be judged subjectively. How easy is the exporter to use? How creative is its approach to porting the design over?</p><p>The judges will weight these different factors in their review and provide a total score. For example, 5% of each submission’s score will be based on the quality of its code and GitHub documentation.

      <description>Launching Figma Local Communities around the world</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earlier this year, we hit the road to meet Figma users in person <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-announces-design-system-meetups-in-6-cities-around-the-world-ef0a74c60842">at our Design System Meetups</a>. In 8 cities across 4 continents, our community came out in force to share lessons and stories with one another. Conversations ran the gamut and covered topics far deeper than basic tips ‘n tricks. People debated the most effective ways to run design critiques, talked through the pros and cons of open design culture and forged new partnerships with each other for work.</p><p><a href="https://www.designsystems.com/stories/what-we-learned-from-hosting-eight-design-system-meetups/">We learned a lot</a> during these gatherings, and others felt the same. That made us wonder: How do we empower our community to connect in person more often?</p><p>We spent the last few months figuring out what that could look like, and today we’re excited to introduce the first step: <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/">Figma Local Communities around the globe</a>. We’re launching with groups in 20+ cities (and adding new ones every day). A sampling — Accra, Amsterdam, Berlin, Boston, Copenhagen, Lagos, London, New York, San Francisco, Seattle, Tel Aviv. <a href="https://www.figma.com/community/">You can see the full-list here</a>.</p><h2 id="what-do-you-want-to-see-in-your-city"><a href="#what-do-you-want-to-see-in-your-city">What do you want to see in your city?</a></h2><p>We picked these cities through a combination of art and science. Some places have evangelists already throwing Figma-related meetups. Others have a particularly concentrated Figma user base. We’re excited to launch with such a wide array of geographies covered, and this is only the beginning.</p><div><blockquote><p>Some of our new Local Communities: Accra, Amsterdam, Berlin, Boston, Copenhagen, Lagos, London, New York</p></blockquote></div><p>We envision these groups being a supportive place where people can connect, learn and share. Sure, that may include Figma best practices and workflows, but also the challenges and successes designers face every day.</p><p>If you want to get involved, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScOLpaDCMzT84REth3zm80TN1x4wYNZTPQzPnYmfTZdx8uNZA/viewform">fill out this form to</a>:</p><ul><li>Start a Figma group in your city</li><li>Share what you want to see with your Local Community</li><li>Pitch specific meetups or other events in your area</li></ul><h2 id="the-designer-advocate-team"><a href="#the-designer-advocate-team">The Designer Advocate team:</a></h2><p>To make sure your ideas are heard, we created the Designer Advocate role at Figma.

He brought Figma to the Square design team in 2013, making him one of our earliest adopters. After we met him in person (at Figma’s first ever Shindigma!) Zach became a valuable source of feedback on the product, gamely jumping on calls whenever we were testing a new feature.

      <description>How Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Talent’s Design team leverages Figma’s API to empower designers</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Each year, Microsoft hosts a company-wide hackathon called, <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/life/one-week-microsoftlife/">OneWeek</a>. Known as the largest private hackathon in the world, Microsoft employees are encouraged to step away from their day jobs and use the time to dream big, tackle problems, and pursue passions. For the Dynamics365 for Talent design team, that meant it was time to focus on streamlining the laborious handoff between design and engineering.</p><p>Ever since the release of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/">Microsoft’s Fluent Design System</a>, the Dynamics 365 for Talent team has been hyper focused on scaling out visceral design elements rather than building out new features (aka, the fun stuff). While striving to hit a 1:10 ratio of designers to engineers on the team, there was an overwhelming need to streamline handoff. Designers had to campaign and negotiate even the smallest design updates. While the engineers had to prioritize each request against the extensive workload that comes with being at a large enterprise company.

      <title>Aisle Rocket Studios, the agency behind Whirlpool, masters remote collaboration</title>

      <description>How ARS runs 80% of the creative process in the browser</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aisle Rocket Studios is the digital powerhouse behind iconic household brands like Whirlpool, Maytag, Sears and more. The agency’s approach is all about being fast and nimble. With a portfolio of 25+ brands, 250+ employees, four offices and remote associates, Aisle Rocket Studios is not your typical agency. As featured in <a href="https://marketing.cioreview.com/vendor/2017/aisle_rocket_studios">CIOReview</a>, ARS’s Chief Digital Officer Kashif Zaman explains, “Our clients see us as an extension of their team. We are their growth hackers and relentless problem solvers.”</p><p>Distinguishing themselves from the typical agency model, the designers at ARS identify themselves as builders. As Zaman puts it, “It’s the idea that the development team is technically a member of the creative team and there is a level of homogeneity between the roles — their skill sets are different but the creative process is interchangeable.” Therefore, one of the core design principles at ARS is that 80 percent of the creative process should take place in the browser. But given the agency is spread out across four locations with remote associates, real collaboration was a challenge. That was until the Whirlpool account team made big waves.</p><h2 id="so-many-files-in-so-many-places"><a href="#so-many-files-in-so-many-places">So many files in so many places!</a></h2><p>Matt Carson, Creative Director at ARS working remote in Scottsdale, was brought onto the Whirlpool account last minute to help with a particular project with a tight deadline. With a short turnaround looming, Carson recalls colleagues sending all sorts of native work files — some in Sketch, others in Photoshop. “It was a hot mess,” explains Carson, “there was no central process for the organization.”</p><p>Carson’s primary objective quickly became to establish a centralized toolkit. So when Isaac Vander Ark, Associate Creative Director at ARS, sent Carson a Figma link, Carson immediately laughed, “you’ve gotta be kidding me, another piece of software!” But unlike other tools, Carson was intrigued with Figma’s multiplayer collaboration feature. As Carson put it, “it was exactly what ARS needed to have a real-time space to collaborate and work across time zones and — it was a no-brainer.”</p><div><blockquote><p>I romanticize Figma because it creates this total collaborative environment where no longer is a writer, designer or developer working in different mediums and different spaces.” — Matt Carson, Creative Director, Aisle Rocket Studios</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="collaboration-more-creativity"><a href="#collaboration-more-creativity">Collaboration = more creativity.</a></h2><p>The Whirlpool account team was the ideal testing ground for Figma because everyone was dispersed. Figma would act as the new source of truth and point of collaboration for the Whirlpool account team. “We put to bed the other workflows and tools and centralized everything on Figma almost overnight,” said Carson. In no time, the team was iterating and designing together in a single file, running internal meetings on Figma, soliciting feedback from internal stakeholders and sharing prototypes with clients.</p><div><blockquote><p>We now have a dynamic, collaborative environment that enables us to brainstorm together, bounce ideas off one another and ultimately be more creative.” — Taylor Madaffari, Copywriter, Aisle Rocket Studios</p></blockquote></div><p>For client Glenn Roper, Digital Brand Manager at Whirlpool Brand, he’s able to visualize complex design elements in a single view. Roper says, “With Figma I’m able to view and share digital concepts with simulated functionality without needing a login or having developers code the experience.” As a result, the review process between agency and client become significantly shorter because they can iterate together in real-time.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="inclusive-design-empowers"><a href="#inclusive-design-empowers">Inclusive design empowers.</a></h2><p>With a shared workspace in Figma, it’s all the easier to host 80 percent of the creative process in the browser. Zaman explains, “We don’t need to physically share a screen to collaborate, rather developers can follow along with designers or copywriters with designers, all within Figma.”</p><p>For Taylor Madaffari, copywriter at ARS, having access to make changes to copy directly within designs has completely changed her approach as a copywriter. She no longer has to work in a separate space, drop in copy and make updates so it fits within a design, instead she and Vander Ark are already collaborating in the early stages of design. Madaffari explains, “Figma leveled the playing field and made the entire design process more democratic. For the first time, I feel empowered to have input on designs.” Copy is no longer an afterthought but rather a distinct design element.</p><figure></figure><p>And developers have embraced Figma, too. Before, the team was handing off static files to development which resulted in a lot of back and forth. “It was excruciating at times for our developers so they welcomed Figma with open arms,” recalls Carson. Figma reduces the friction of turning visual concepts into code because developers are granted viewer access to files early to make sure designs are achievable from the onset.</p><h2 id="a-small-team-makes-big-impact"><a href="#a-small-team-makes-big-impact">A small team makes big impact.</a></h2><p>The Whirlpool team started to capture the attention of the larger agency, they were leaner, faster and more collaborative. As Zaman puts it, “they had the magic sauce and everyone wanted in.” With Figma, the team consolidated their tooling, tightened complex workflows and centralized files. Even client Glenn Roper, digital brand manager at Whirlpool, agrees, “Figma enables greater collaboration between my team and our agency, saving time and money without sacrificing creativity.”</p><p>Today, collaborative open design is the standard at ARS. Inspired by the collaborative nature of the Whirlpool team, Vander Ark is helping get the entire design team at ARS onto Figma. “People are seeing Figma as the new industry standard,” explains Vander Ark.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44f934eb0252d16914760c9a76efe690e399d066-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44f934eb0252d16914760c9a76efe690e399d066-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44f934eb0252d16914760c9a76efe690e399d066-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44f934eb0252d16914760c9a76efe690e399d066-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44f934eb0252d16914760c9a76efe690e399d066-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44f934eb0252d16914760c9a76efe690e399d066-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="what-s-next"><a href="#what-s-next">What’s next?</a></h2><p>Design systems. The Whirlpool team is embarking on a new journey to build more consistency across the digital brand. Following the principles of atomic design, the goal is to have the atoms built to spec in Figma and saved to the team library as a source of truth. And as the agency moves towards standardizing on Figma, they’re looking to create a one-to-one design language system for base components that can be used across brands — be it Maytag or Whirlpool.</p><p>The sky’s the limit for this agency.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma Feature Highlight: Component Overrides</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-feature-highlight-component-overrides/</link>
      <description>Design systems must strike the right balance between flexibility and consistency.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>In the Figma Feature Highlights series (see <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-fun-fact-click-an-avatar-in-a-file-to-watch-someone-move-around-the-design-2d00fc5e412e">1</a> and <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-feature-highlight-sketch-import-dbb71c1935dd">2</a>), we’ve been showcasing Figma’s super powers with ideas on how to use them. This week we cover “component overrides.” If the concept of “Components” in Figma is new to you, we recommend first reading <a href="https://help.figma.com/drawing/components">our Support article on Components</a> here or our <a href="https://blog.figma.com/components-in-figma-e7e80fcf6fd2">original Components announcement blog.</a></em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="VRxbPUcMp0yf" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Design systems must strike the right balance between flexibility and consistency. You might use the same foundational components everywhere, like lists, avatars or status bars, but you’ll still need to tweak and adapt instances of them depending on context. Maybe individual list items will have different lines of text, or the background color on a status bar will change if a user hovers over it.</p><p>Instead of forcing you to build these particular instances from scratch, design tools should make it easy for you to tweak the original component, while still maintaining your design system.</p><p>That’s where Figma’s component overrides function comes in handy. Overrides work exactly how they sound — by allowing you to “override” properties of a design instance without breaking it apart from its parent component. You can change things like the background color, font, stroke, or other properties in an instance, and the instance will still stay connected to the original parent component. As a result, when you adjust the parent component, the instance will continue to inherit those changes — while maintaining its distinct differentiators.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="overrides-in-action"><a href="#overrides-in-action">Overrides in action</a></h2><p>In Figma, you can override a nearly endless number of properties in an instance, including:</p><ul><li>Color</li><li>Type alignment</li><li>Add, remove, modify strokes</li><li>Styles</li><li>Opacity</li><li>Blend mode</li><li>Fills</li><li>Effects (drop shadows, blurs)</li><li>Text</li><li>Visibility (show/hide)</li></ul><p>If you’re looking for inspiration, here are a few concrete examples of ways you might use overrides to maintain consistency in your design system.</p><p>1) <strong>Create a realistic list of information</strong> — Working on a simple to-do app or a complex table view for a dashboard? Create a single “cell” component and override the text in each separate instance to add unique data.</p><p>2) <strong>Show a button in different states</strong> — Need to show different states of a button after user behavior (hovering, pressing, ignoring, etc)? Use a single button component and override its background color (or text opacity…or drop shadow…or whatever you’d like!).</p><p>3) <strong>Build an address book with photographs</strong> — Want to create an address book with different people’s profiles? Override the fill from a circle component with placed images — like photographs — to customize each avatar.</p><figure></figure><p>4) <strong>Make a kaleidoscope</strong> — Looking for a little bonus fun? One of our designers, Rasmus Andersson, created the kaleidoscope gif below to dazzle you with the power of overrides.</p><p><strong>Here’s how to create your own kaleidoscope at home:</strong></p><ol><li>Make a frame, draw an illustration in it and convert it to a component.</li><li>Duplicate it to create an instance and place it adjacent to the right. Flip horizontal (shift-H).</li><li>Duplicate again and place the new instance below the previous. Flip vertical (shift-V).</li><li>Duplicate one more time and place the new instance in the “hole” that’s left to form a large 2x2 rectangle. Flip horizontal (shift-H).</li><li>Draw in the original component (top left corner) and watch the kaleidoscope unravel.</li></ol><h2 id="faqs-about-component-overrides"><a href="#faqs-about-component-overrides">FAQs about component overrides</a></h2><p>We get a lot of questions about component overrides and wanted to capture the most frequent ones and their answers. Here’s the 101 rundown on everything you might want to know about them (<a href="https://help.figma.com/drawing/components">and you can find more information in our help documentation here.)</a></p><p><strong>Q: Can you duplicate a master component in a file?</strong></p><p>A: No, it isn’t possible to duplicate a component in a single file. When you do that it will always create an instance of the original component. However, when you copy a component from file A and paste it into file B, you will have a fully functioning component in file B.</p><p><strong>Q: Can you reset overrides in an instance?</strong></p><p>A: Yes! If you decide you want to reset a component back to its original state then you can, but one of the unique things about Figma is that you can also reset any property for each element within your instance.</p><p><strong>Q: If you edit your master component, will it automatically update the overridden instance?</strong></p><p>A: Yes and no. As you further change the master component, you’ll see that the instance still updates accordingly, except for whatever property you manually changed. For example, if you have a blue circle as a component and change the instance’s color to green, then the instance will stay green even if you edit the master component to be red. However, if you change the stroke weight of the master component, then the instance will reflect those changes synchronously.</p><p><strong>Q: Do overrides work across files?</strong></p><p>A: No, they do not.</p><p><strong>Q: Are there any properties you can’t override?</strong></p><p>A: Yes, any properties that impact the layout of child layers. That includes:</p><ul><li>Size</li><li>Position</li><li>Point and bezier positions</li><li>Constraint settings</li></ul><h2 id="which-little-known-feature-should-we-highlight"><a href="#which-little-known-feature-should-we-highlight">Which little known feature should we highlight next?</a></h2><p>Let us know what you think what should get the next Figma Feature Highlight treatment in the comments!

      <description>Did you know Sketch’s symbols import into Figma as components?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here at Figma we know news can get buried and release notes can go overlooked…no matter how many times you refresh Twitter. So we’ve decided to resurface some evergreen features and give them five minutes of Figma blog fame. Last week we zeroed in on Observation Mode, and this week? It’s all about Sketch Import, which lets you transfer Sketch files directly into your Figma file space.</p><p>Even though we released Sketch Import in June of 2015, we still see fans discovering it. For example, the tweet below is from only two months ago.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/043c2abe2cf43320f689f88439f08a25ec055eeb-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/043c2abe2cf43320f689f88439f08a25ec055eeb-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/043c2abe2cf43320f689f88439f08a25ec055eeb-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/043c2abe2cf43320f689f88439f08a25ec055eeb-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/043c2abe2cf43320f689f88439f08a25ec055eeb-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="why-sketch-import-is-essential-for-figma-users"><a href="#why-sketch-import-is-essential-for-figma-users">Why Sketch Import is essential for Figma users</a></h2><ol><li><strong>Initial switch.</strong> For those designers switching from Sketch, it would be too much to ask for them to recreate all of their previous work. (Remember the Photoshop to Sketch transition?) New users need an easy and reliable solution to make that digital leap.</li><li><strong>Teams stay synced on design.</strong> Working on a project with a team who prefers a wide array of design tools and operating systems? With Figma, a developer on Windows or Linux can easily import a Sketch file for specs, regardless of the fact that Sketch is Mac-only.</li><li><strong>Hopping between the tools.</strong> Some designers love to work in a silo in Sketch, and then drop their design file into Figma for the collaborative benefits, such as an impromptu design critique or to communicate amongst remote stakeholders. Figma’s commenting feature helps everyone stay on the same page.</li></ol><p>Our Sketch Import is like a hidden secret power because of its vigilant accuracy. In addition to preserving your pages and resizing constraints, it can even import symbols into Figma as <a href="https://blog.figma.com/component-architecture-in-figma-f16ae9cc4481">components</a> — a neat trick for those companies building out or maintaining a design system.

      <title>The University of the Arts London’s Accidental Path to a Design System</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/the-university-of-the-arts-londons-accidental-path-to-a-design-system/</link>
      <description>Since last year (2017), the User Experience team has been focused on reshaping UAL’s core digital experience to be more user-centric as part of the Digital Transformation Program.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The University of the Arts London is ranked the sixth university in the world for Art and Design in the <a href="https://newsevents.arts.ac.uk/53488/ual-in-worlds-top-6-universities-for-art-design-2018/">QS world rankings</a>. It has impacted the creative industries worldwide, in part by launching the iconic careers of Lubaina Himid, Stella McCartney and Anish Kapoor… just to name a few.</p><p>But it wasn’t until 2004 that the colleges formed an official federation under the name “University of the Arts London,” aka UAL. Today, the university is made up of six colleges, each with their own <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/about-ual">rich history</a> and identity — most dating back to the early 19th century. But their unique past presents design challenges because the organization uses a number of identities. As Declan Talbert, a UX designer at UAL, put it, “everyone looks after their own site and they each want to implement their own style.” As a result, UAL’s digital experiences can feel disjointed and inconsistent.</p><p>Since last year (2017), the User Experience team has been focused on reshaping UAL’s core digital experience to be more user-centric as part of the Digital Transformation Program. The team partnered with the University’s brand, content and development teams for the program. Updating the website was phase one. And while a design system would be an eventual output of the project, the team stumbled upon the opportunity midway through the website project. As Andrea Caporale, UX manager at UAL, said, “the design system was good collateral damage.”</p><h2 id="making-the-switch-mid-project"><a href="#making-the-switch-mid-project">Making the switch mid-project</a></h2><p>The UX team tested several design tools during the early phases of the website project and struggled with the siloed nature of most applications. As Talbert said, “We immediately fell into issues trying to collaborate with our Sketch files — the problem was we were not able to work seamlessly on files together.” Between working with outside agencies and internal stakeholders spread across 14 campuses, the team grew frustrated. Versioning issues caused confusion, syncing files took time, and, as a result, communication loops became exhausting which caused a rift between dev and design.</p><div><blockquote><p>After just three days we saw all the benefits of Figma.</p></blockquote></div><p>After testing out Figma, Talbert recommended the team try it. Because Figma is accessible from any computer with a browser and enabled the team to collaborate online in real-time, they decided to make the switch, even though they were midway through the website project. Because importing their original files from Sketch was a simple drag and drop, Caporale said, “after just three days we saw all the benefits of Figma.” Having a centralized source of the truth across developers, designers, key stakeholders and even executives resulted in an unprecedented level of transparency. And most impactful was the new level of collaboration between development and design. According to front-end developer Bo Ajayi-Walmsley, “Just seeing all our work within one tool was incredibly useful.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4f4c4e87e7ae41042f0c06650d3103c17ea926f8-1600x900.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="go-big-with-figma"><a href="#go-big-with-figma">Go big with Figma</a></h2><p>Equipped with the right tool all teams and external agencies were finally speaking the same language. But given the extensive nature of the website project, the team decided they’d have to build everything from scratch. In an effort to save time, Caporale saw the opportunity to prioritize the design system. As Caporale puts it, “building out the Design System came naturally thanks to the quality of features in Figma.” Thus, the UAL design system was born.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a9dce03f08b8b23ae7e25f0e638a16eb1876d47-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a9dce03f08b8b23ae7e25f0e638a16eb1876d47-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a9dce03f08b8b23ae7e25f0e638a16eb1876d47-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a9dce03f08b8b23ae7e25f0e638a16eb1876d47-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a9dce03f08b8b23ae7e25f0e638a16eb1876d47-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="project-design-system"><a href="#project-design-system">Project: Design System</a></h2><p>The teams worked in tandem on both the design system and the website project, both were of equal importance to the overall website redesign and helpful to align other Digital Transformation Program key projects. Caporale said, “The design system was not just about creating components for our website, it was a way to connect together all of our channels and give them the same style and functionality.” The goal was to harmonize components across colleges and streamline processes.</p><p>To get started, the UX team conducted a series of workshops with students and business partners to understand what features were critical in the design system.

And given the complexity of UAL’s brand, the design system had to be flexible enough to allow the use of different colors, typography and personality. Using the team library in Figma allowed the UX team to have a living version of their brand guidelines that is accessible to all — no matter their device or location. And with the recent release of <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-3-0-217d6c248f85">Figma Styles</a>, “it was like our prayers were answered,” said Talbert. Because Styles allows you to apply color styles separately from text and effect styles, the team can provide an added level of flexibility.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8cbcf3b4e13775380302e2f6ad8e92bbfbcff4a-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8cbcf3b4e13775380302e2f6ad8e92bbfbcff4a-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8cbcf3b4e13775380302e2f6ad8e92bbfbcff4a-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8cbcf3b4e13775380302e2f6ad8e92bbfbcff4a-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8cbcf3b4e13775380302e2f6ad8e92bbfbcff4a-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="fast-delivery-the-figma-way"><a href="#fast-delivery-the-figma-way">Fast delivery, the Figma way</a></h2><p>With the design system taking shape, the website project moved at lightning speed. Leveraging components, the team built base pages to act as templates, enabling development to spin up new pages fast. According to Joshua Shindler, Digital Development manager at UAL, “With our Design System in Figma, we’re able to move faster because we’re able to instantly see how designs can be created in code.” The teams were finally synchronized around one common system. For the first time, the teams could actually bridge the gap between developers and designers and effectively communicate with each other.</p><div><blockquote><p>We’re able to move faster because we can instantly see how designs can be created in code.</p></blockquote></div><p>Collecting feedback on the website design was simplified, too. “The executive board can access a Figma link, view it at their leisure and see how the website project is developing,” says Talbert.</p><h2 id="a-new-journey-for-ual"><a href="#a-new-journey-for-ual">A New Journey for UAL</a></h2><p>In the end, the <a href="https://www.arts.ac.uk/">new UAL website launched</a> — and on time. But it was the reaction to the project that may have been the biggest win. Everyone in the organisation feels this as an exciting, new beginning — from the students through to the executive board. As Caporale puts it, “Our design system in Figma marks the starting point of a new journey where we build more consistently and speak the same language across every single part of the UAL experience.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The finale of Prototyping Week: Interactions</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/the-finale-of-prototyping-week-interactions/</link>
      <description>If you’ve been following along on Twitter, you know we spent the last four days celebrating Prototyping Week at Figma, with daily releases like landscape device frames and clickable URLs.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’ve been following along on Twitter, you know we spent the last four days celebrating <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FigmaProtoWeek?src=hash">Prototyping Week</a> at Figma, with daily releases like landscape device frames and clickable URLs.</p><p>I worked on many of these updates during my summer engineering internship here at Figma, so I’ve enjoyed reading all your reactions (and predictions about what’s coming next). Before I head back to school, I have one last feature to leave you with: Interactions.</p><p>With Interactions, you can now add hover and pressed states to buttons as well as imitate long presses and dropdown menus. This should make your prototypes feel more realistic since elements will behave how they would in production. As always, the Figma community helped guide the form and priorities of our product, and we’re grateful to the teams who spent time working with us in the user research phase.</p><p>Read on for more details on Interactions, and a quick recap of everything we shipped this week!</p><h2 id="interactions"><a href="#interactions">Interactions</a></h2><figure></figure><p>People interact with applications in a wide range of ways. They hover over buttons to view tooltips or press elements to see additional functionality, and they expect applications to respond automatically.</p><p>For a prototype to feel real, the buttons and elements inside it also need to respond to the user’s input in these predictable ways. Through our new Interactions feature, you can create these rich experiences for more accurate user testing.</p><p><strong>Here’s the full list of Interactions now available to you in Figma:</strong></p><ol><li>On Click</li><li>While Hovering</li><li>While Pressing</li><li>Mouse Enter</li><li>Mouse Leave</li><li>Mouse Down</li><li>Mouse Up</li><li>After Delay</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6aa98fbc19e16f659c0490b6dfb148444b8c5ae6-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6aa98fbc19e16f659c0490b6dfb148444b8c5ae6-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6aa98fbc19e16f659c0490b6dfb148444b8c5ae6-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6aa98fbc19e16f659c0490b6dfb148444b8c5ae6-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6aa98fbc19e16f659c0490b6dfb148444b8c5ae6-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>There are three Interactions we think you’ll find most useful: “On Click”, “While Hovering” and “While Pressing.” These allow you to show hover states of buttons or communicate the pressed state of a list item. For example, if someone hovers over a menu item in your prototype, you can change the item’s background color.</p><p>Four of our new Interactions offer more advanced functionality: “Mouse Enter,” “Mouse Leave,” “Mouse Down” and “Mouse Up.” They give you more granular control about how the application responds to detailed behavior from the user. For example, if you use “Mouse Enter” on a button to show a dropdown menu, the menu will automatically stay open until the user performs a different interaction.</p><div><blockquote><p>When you have a device frame selected, some interactions will appear as On Tap, Touch Down and Touch Up.</p></blockquote></div><h3 id="after-delay"><a href="#after-delay">After Delay</a></h3><p>We’ve also included the “After Delay” Interaction, which causes transitions to occur automatically after a specified amount of time. Use it to mimic things like notifications and auto-redirected pages.</p><p>You can only set an “After Delay” transition from one screen to another. After all, an “After Delay” transition isn’t tied to any specific sublayer of the frame.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="ewiLnBZvsTCd" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>All this can be a bit abstract, until you play with it. Go check out Interactions yourself in the tool (you’ll find it in the prototype section of the right hand sidebar). To learn more about how to use them, visit our <a href="https://help.figma.com/prototyping/prototyping">Help Center</a>.</p><p>Interactions are the final surprise we have for you in Prototyping Week. For those who don’t follow our Twitter account, here’s the rundown of everything else we shipped this week.</p><h2 id="monday-landscape-device-frames"><a href="#monday-landscape-device-frames">Monday: Landscape Device Frames</a></h2><figure></figure><p>We released <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-3-0-217d6c248f85">Figma 3.0</a> two months ago and added device frames around designs in presentation view. Now you can set device frames around screens that are meant to be viewed sideways.</p><h2 id="tuesday-clickable-urls"><a href="#tuesday-clickable-urls">Tuesday: Clickable URLS</a></h2><figure></figure><p>To integrate Figma designs more with other content, we introduced Clickable URLs, which let you link a prototype frame to an external web link or another Figma file. For example, you could link to a personal website at the end of a presentation deck and send viewers directly to your portfolio when they click the link.</p><h2 id="wednesday-back-transitions"><a href="#wednesday-back-transitions">Wednesday: Back Transitions</a></h2><figure></figure><p>Back Transitions act exactly the way they’re named. Sometimes, you’ll want users of your prototype to be able to return to the previous screen — for instance, you may be designing a confirmation menu. And, if the screen can be accessed from several different locations, Back Transitions allow you to keep track of where the user started without duplicating the screen and transition for each initial location.</p><p>One thing to note: If you navigate to the current frame with an animated transition, pressing the back button will play that animation in reverse. The gif above shows this in action.</p><h2 id="what-s-next"><a href="#what-s-next">What’s next?</a></h2><p>The team is hard at work developing additional features. We’ve heard a lot from the community about Overlays — let us know what else you’d like to see from our prototyping tool set on <a href="https://spectrum.chat/figma">Spectrum</a>!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

On Monday, Kiwi web designer <a href="https://twitter.com/charliprangley">Charli Marie</a> released a YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIyhqEra7Sc&amp;feature=youtu.be">review of Figma</a>, which included a roundup of her favorite details in our web-based, collaborative design tool. She wound up inadvertently teaching a few Figma staffers things we didn’t know— like the fact our layers panel cleans itself up automatically.</p><p>Since we learned from Charli, we thought you might too. Without further ado, here’s Figma Tips 10.0, studded with quotes from Ms. Marie herself.

I love that in Figma it’s the same as in Photoshop — command and a bracket. It’s a super easy shortcut to press, and it makes it really fast to rearrange layers as you’re designing something. I also like that in their menus they show what the shortkey is in case you’ve forgotten. — Charli Marie</p><p>Helpful link: <a href="https://help.figma.com/keyboard-shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts">Shortcuts in Figma</a></p></blockquote></div><h2 id="figma-groups-will-auto-delete-when-empty"><a href="#figma-groups-will-auto-delete-when-empty">Figma groups will auto-delete when empty</a></h2><figure></figure><div><blockquote><p>If you delete all the elements from within a group in Figma, the group itself will disappear, because obviously it’s not a group anymore if there’s nothing in it.

In Figma, you can copy all the properties if you want to, but you could also just copy just the fill or the font or the stroke. It means if you got something right in one place, it’s super easy just to apply it to other things. — Charli Marie</p><p>Easily manipulate images using fill settings instead of masks</p></blockquote></div><figure></figure><div><blockquote><p>In Figma when you drop an image in it actually makes it a rectangle with an image as the fill. So if you want to crop or tile it, you come into the fill settings and make your changes there. That was a little confusing at first, but it’s actually really handy. I’d find in Sketch a lot of the time I’d make a whole bunch of masks to get my image to be the right size. It’s much easier to do that if the image is already — when you put it in — a fill of a shape. — Charli Marie</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="use-figma-s-vector-networks-instead-of"><a href="#use-figma-s-vector-networks-instead-of">Use Figma’s vector networks instead of Illustrator to make complex shapes</a></h2><figure></figure><div><blockquote><p>Figma handles vectors in a completely different way to what I’ve seen before — they use what they call vector networks. In usual vector programs a point can really only have two connections to it, but in Figma you can have multiple and it means you can create complex shapes.

      <title>Learn how a Microsoft designer built an internal Icon Library in his spare time</title>

      <description>Imagine a world where icons coexist no matter which design tool a UI/UX professional prefers.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Imagine a world where icons coexist no matter which design tool a UI/UX professional prefers. The icons live peacefully together, properly tagged and classified, easily searchable by everyone.</p><p>One designer at Microsoft, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jackiechui/">Jackie Chui</a>, built this utopia. In three weeks flat, he spun up a browser-based library with the company’s full set of 4,000 icons. He made searching intuitive by including class names for engineers and tags for designers. Engineers can even do a reverse search to grab metadata by pasting an icon into the library.</p><p>Perhaps the best feature of them all is cross-tool functionality. Because Jackie’s library runs in the browser, anyone at Microsoft can bring the icons straight into their preferred design tool. No more arguing over which application should rule them all.</p><p>If you feel like your icons live in a siloed design nightmare, take a look at Jackie’s pragmatic approach to building a shared icon library.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="how-to-set-up-your-own-icon-library"><a href="#how-to-set-up-your-own-icon-library">How to set up your own Icon Library</a></h2><h3 id="_1-research-the-competitive-landscape-and-your"><a href="#_1-research-the-competitive-landscape-and-your">1. Research the competitive landscape and your users’ needs</a></h3><p>First, like any designer worth their salt, Jackie did his preliminary research. He talked to several designers at Microsoft and watched their design processes in action to best understand their icon issues. Next, he looked for existing products on the market.</p><p>The best Icon Library with organizing and copy/paste capabilities that he could find was <a href="https://geticonjar.com/">IconJar</a>, but it still lacked several features Microsoft needed:</p><ol><li>It didn’t have the ability to share and crowdsource tags. Jackie knew he wanted everyone the autonomy to contribute tags for icons.</li><li>It wasn’t browser-based, meaning the icons couldn’t live in the cloud.</li><li>It was Mac only — a big turn-off to the company who created Windows.</li></ol><p>He decided he’d need to build a tool from scratch to meet the company’s unique needs. He wanted to keep the project a secret and launch it as a fun surprise for his coworkers, so he worked on it after-hours.</p><h3 id="_2-design-and-develop-your-tool-with-the-wisdom"><a href="#_2-design-and-develop-your-tool-with-the-wisdom">2. Design and develop your tool with the wisdom of a designer and engineer</a></h3><p>As an early step, he built a basic version of his planned icon library’s UI in Sketch. (These days Jackie uses Figma — we’ve become the primary design tool for Microsoft’s Cloud and AI design studio teams 💪.) He took inspiration from IconJar’s design and mocked up a similar version, styling it in Microsoft’s Fabric design language.</p><p>Once he was finished with the design, he needed to build it. He had some experience with HTML, CSS and Javascript from creating his portfolio website, so he decided to leverage that existing knowledge by tapping a beginner-friendly Javascript library called <a href="https://www.meteor.com/">Meteor.js</a>. It allowed him to build both the front-end and back-end databases without spending too much time mastering a new programming language.</p><p>He took a <a href="https://www.meteor.com/tutorials">React tutorial</a> on Meteor’s website, and applied what he learned to build the icon library. For example, Meteor’s tutorial taught Jackie how to build a database for a to-do list, and he extended that concept to creating a database for his icon library. With a real problem in mind that needed fixing, he felt more than motivated to learn along the way.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/57b824cd9cb3d5d9a75df7cf04088aa7841c34ba-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="_3-collect-and-extract-the-icons-from-the-company"><a href="#_3-collect-and-extract-the-icons-from-the-company">3. Collect and extract the icons from the company’s repository</a></h3><p>For those not in the know, icons are normally stored in a font file. The challenge with icons is that you cannot ‘type’ the icons using your keyboard since there are many more characters than keys on a keyboard. Instead, you have to copy the ‘icon character’ and paste it into your design to use. Previously, designers had to keep a file with a bunch of icon characters that they used often so they could copy and paste in their designs. What Jackie’s tool does is allow designers to search and copy the ‘icon character’ easily in one central location.</p><p>He downloaded and extracted the files and got the actual unicode characters of each icon. Next he found a Microsoft documentation page with all the icons and their corresponding class names used by engineers. He copied the list of icon names into an Excel spreadsheet then converted that into a JSON file to use in his code. Presto.</p><h3 id="_4-distribution"><a href="#_4-distribution">4. Distribution</a></h3><p>After three weeks of not sleeping a whole lot, the first version of his Icon Library was ready. He hosted the tool on Microsoft Azure, a cloud-computing service for building and managing services and applications that is open to the public . At this point he didn’t think too much about the distribution, he just sent a simple email with a link to the tool to his team, then it spread to the rest of the design studio through word-of-mouth. Instantly it was a hit (see pile of emails below for evidence.)</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fbd98e7c2827d35401d5ce9c21d529b2dc340705-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fbd98e7c2827d35401d5ce9c21d529b2dc340705-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fbd98e7c2827d35401d5ce9c21d529b2dc340705-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fbd98e7c2827d35401d5ce9c21d529b2dc340705-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fbd98e7c2827d35401d5ce9c21d529b2dc340705-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fbd98e7c2827d35401d5ce9c21d529b2dc340705-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Currently, Jackie’s working on a V2 of his Icon Library. His coworkers are helping him find bugs and suggesting new features, however it’s already wormed itself into many designers’ workflow. Once he’s done building the last few features and fixing the remaining bugs, he’ll share it more publicly to other Microsoft teams to extend the tool’s impact.</p><p>Plans for the future<br/>So, what’s next for our tireless overachiever? 😉 In the coming months Jackie wants to develop a converter that, with one click, could take all 4000+ icons from his Icon Library and turn them into Figma components. This would allow everyone at Microsoft to organize and search for icons much more easily inside Figma without having to go through an intermediary tool. Yep, his new tool will make his last one obsolete.</p><p>The potential for this goes far beyond Microsoft icons. Eventually Jackie plans to make his converter available to the design community, allowing anyone to be able to drop in an icon font file and get all their icons back as Figma components.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>With Figma’s new SVG Exports, less = more</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/with-figmas-new-svg-exports-less-more/</link>
      <description>Why we moved away from SVG novels</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Here’s one big lesson we’ve learned since <a href="https://www.figma.com/">launching collaborative design tool Figma</a>: when it comes to SVG Export, less is more. For a long time, we stuck as much information as possible into our SVG files, hoping it would help other tools render and import designs accurately.</p><p>Fueled by feedback from our community, we’ve had a change of heart and have been gradually tweaking the Export format over the past few months. As our <a href="https://releases.figma.com/">release note junkies</a> have noticed, our SVGs are now simpler, more compact and compatible with more tools (like Android Studio). Read on for a quick primer on SVG and details about what we changed.</p><p>SVG — which stands for Scalable Vector Graphics — is an increasingly popular image format for 2D vector graphics. It emerged in 2001 as an open specification aimed primarily for use in web browsers. Unlike traditional bitmap image formats like JPG and PNG that become blurry when resized, SVG is designed to always remain crystal clear.</p><p>That’s because SVGs are effectively instructions describing how to paint an image from scratch while bitmap images are static snapshots of the final result. SVG is perfect for assets like logos and icons on the web, where they might show up anywhere from a huge monitor to a high resolution retina screen on a phone.</p><div><blockquote><p>Here’s the rub though: there’s no standardized way of converting the SVG markup to pixels on the screen.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here’s the rub though: there’s no standardized way of converting the SVG markup to pixels on the screen. Most tools have their own custom SVG importers or renderers and the quality of these implementations varies widely. The SVG specification is also sufficiently complex that most tools only understand a subset and have bugs even when dealing with the subset that they claim to support.</p><p>For example, SVG has a nifty feature that allows you to define instructions in a <code>defs</code> block and reference them repeatedly with the <code>use</code> element. As we learned the hard way, Android Studio does not support this in most cases.</p><p>In addition to choking many importers, our complicated and extraneous markup also bloated the file size and made the output difficult to digest for humans. Many of our users had resort to post-processing with tools such as SVGO and svgito or, even worse, by manually cleaning up the file by hand. 😬😬😬</p><h2 id="from-figma-s-svg-na-vet-to-our-new-pragmatic"><a href="#from-figma-s-svg-na-vet-to-our-new-pragmatic">From Figma’s SVG naïveté… to our new pragmatic approach</a></h2><p>People have been asking for smaller, simpler SVGs from Figma for a long time. We resisted making the change because we were hoping that SVG would become the de facto data transfer format between design tools. In this utopia, you could easily spread your design workflow across different design tools depending on what was the best fit for each stage.</p><p>We now accept that was a bit of pie-in-the-sky naïveté, and our new SVG Exporter takes a more pragmatic approach.</p><p>To understand the improvements, let’s start with a seemingly innocent example: a frame containing a single black rectangle with a grey inside stroke.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87440f826b54b4f49df2068222052e45d7739720-200x200.png?w=670&amp;h=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87440f826b54b4f49df2068222052e45d7739720-200x200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 200w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="with-our-old-svg-exporter-we-generated-this"><a href="#with-our-old-svg-exporter-we-generated-this">With our old SVG Exporter, we generated this embarrassing novel:</a></h3><div><pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>svg</span><span> </span><span>width</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>100</span><span>&#34;</span><span> </span><span>height</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>100</span><span>&#34;</span><span> </span><span>viewBox</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>0 0 100 100</span><span>&#34;</span><span> </span><span>version</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>1.1</span><span>&#34;</span><span> </span><span>xmlns</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>http://www.w3.org/2000/svg</span><span>&#34;</span><span> </span><span>xmlns:</span><span>xlink</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span><span>

Previously, we did this by using center strokes with a doubled stroke width. That is visually equivalent to having both an inside and outside stroke so we used a <code>mask</code> to hide the unnecessary half. This approach greatly inflated the file size and complicated the markup.</p><p>We now try to adjust the points in the path such that the visual result will resemble an inside or outside stroke while using center strokes with the original stroke width. For example, a rectangle with an inner stroke can be represented as smaller rectangle with a center stroke.</p><div><pre><code><span>  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>mask</span><span> </span><span>id</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>path-1-inside-1</span><span>&#34;</span><span> </span><span>fill</span><span>=</span><span>&#34;</span><span>white</span><span>&#34;</span><span>&gt;</span><span>

For example, we used to always output a <code>clipPath</code> for clipped frames, but now we do so only when clipping is actually necessary.</p><p>Finally, we now inline SVG elements where we previously had a <code>use</code> reference to a deduplicated element defined within the <code>defs</code> block. Even though we lost deduplication, it turns out that the simplified structure actually reduces the overall file size in most cases. This is especially true when the SVGs are compressed with something like gzip.</p><p><strong>Export Options</strong></p><p>The new SVG Export defaults are optimized for the most common usecases. For example, most of our users will not miss the id attributes, but for those of you that do, we went ahead and added an option. We also have an option to control the markup for strokes and text objects.</p><p>We hope Figma’s new short ‘n&#39; sweet SVGs have been treating you well.

      <title>Figma, faster 🏎</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-faster/</link>
      <description>File loading, dragging &amp; zooming is up to 3x faster</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For design tools to be effective, speed is essential. If there are delays in the wrong places, it totally ruins the illusion that the tool is an extension of your mind and body. Imagine the frustration of trying to pound in a nail when the hammer trails behind your hand by half a second.</p><p>We want Figma to be an extension of your creative mind. To meet that goal, we need to remove as much friction as possible from the process of placing your ideas into a visual space to discuss, collaborate on and convert into working software. To reduce that friction, we need an ongoing focus on Figma’s performance.</p><p>Since the beginning, we’ve tried to design every feature with performance in mind. When we discover targeted performance wins through careful analysis of our code (running on real documents that users share with us), we take them. Occasionally, however, opportunities to reap huge wins present themselves.</p><div><blockquote><p>We want Figma to be an extension of your creative mind.</p></blockquote></div><p>Earlier this year, we figured out that restructuring our document renderer and ironing out WebAssembly bugs could make Figma significantly faster. We worked on these optimizations for months. The reward was massive improvements in zooming, dragging and file loading speed (up to 3x faster!) in dense files.</p><p>We rolled out these changes to the entire user base over the past several weeks. Read on to learn more about what changed, how we measured these gains, and what’s next for performance work in Figma.</p><h2 id="file-loading-up-to-3x-faster"><a href="#file-loading-up-to-3x-faster">File loading — up to 3x faster</a></h2><figure><figcaption>File loading speed in action, on a real design document </figcaption></figure><p>As our product matures, we’ve noticed teams at large organizations creating ever more complex design documents in Figma. Users push our tool to its limits, nesting components many layers deep to give them flexibility and power in their design systems.</p><p>The Fluent Design Team at Microsoft, for example, rebuilt every Windows native control in a single Figma document, capturing components in all possible states and permutations. These seemingly simple operations add a lot of computational complexity, and load times suffered.</p><p>“We were stress-testing the limits of what Figma could do before we adopted it as our team’s primary tool,” Kyle Anderson, Senior Product Designer on the Fluent team, told us.</p><p>Fortunately, over the last 2 months WebAssembly optimizations and a collection of other changes helped us reduce the load time for a large realistic document from 29 seconds down to under 8 seconds.</p><p>&#34;It’s considerably more lightweight and much more performant,” Kyle said. “The speed at which your team hot fixes stuff is really encouraging, and we couldn’t be happier with the product.&#34; WebAssembly is now enabled in all the common places that our users work within Figma [1]. This includes the desktop app, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both macOS and Windows. The impact of this is huge across the board.</p><h2 id="continuous-interactions"><a href="#continuous-interactions">Continuous Interactions</a></h2><p>Of course, the importance of performance doesn’t end when your file has loaded. Two of the most common operations where Figma users need speed are zooming in/out and dragging layers.</p><p>We renewed our focus on improving the fluidity of these common behaviors, and since the beginning of the year, we’ve reduced the “hitches” you see when zooming or dragging.</p><h3 id="zooming-is-now-up-to-3x-faster"><a href="#zooming-is-now-up-to-3x-faster">Zooming is now up to 3x faster.</a></h3><figure><figcaption>Zooming now actually zoooooms</figcaption></figure><h3 id="dragging-is-now-up-to-3x-faster"><a href="#dragging-is-now-up-to-3x-faster">Dragging is now up to 3x faster.</a></h3><figure><figcaption>Dragging feels like less of a drag</figcaption></figure><p>N3TWORK, a 100-person gaming and media company, particularly appreciated these improvements. Their files are dense and packed with bitmap images, so their UX Design Director Adam Donkin came by in person to talk through performance. “That’s one of the best things about Figma — I feel like I’ve built a relationship with people there, and we work through problems together,” he said. “It makes it feel like Figma is my product.”</p><p>After a few minutes diagnosing the issue with Adam in person, we enabled our new renderer for N3TWORK. They saw an instantaneous uptick in the speed of component publishing and file loading. “You didn’t have to measure it, it was completely obvious,” Adam said. “I walked back to the office and several people had tested it and were seeing improvements in all cases. That was super exciting.”</p><h3 id="why-we-measure-both-average-frame-time-maximum"><a href="#why-we-measure-both-average-frame-time-maximum">Why we measure both average frame time &amp; maximum frame time</a></h3><p>With continuous operations like zooming and dragging, it’s smoothness we care about, not duration. There’s a huge experiential gap between a drag taking 500ms and getting no feedback until it’s complete versus a drag taking 500ms where you’re getting full visual feedback at 60 frames per second.</p><p>One of our design team’s guiding principles is “favor direct manipulation,” and nothing breaks the illusion of direct manipulation like delayed and infrequent feedback.</p><div><blockquote><p>One of our design team’s guiding principles is “favor direct manipulation.”</p></blockquote></div><p>To measure the quality of this feedback, we track two key metrics: average frame time and maximum frame time. Each contribute to smoothness in dragging, so they both must be monitored to understand the impact of an optimization.</p><p>Higher maximum frame times produce a jarring “hitching” effect, like your sailing boat suddenly hitting a rock. In comparison, higher average times produce choppiness, like driving a car over cobblestones.</p><p>The below examples show this difference between the two in practice.</p><figure><figcaption>Maximum frame times increase (from left to right) while average frame times stay the same</figcaption></figure><p>With this example of maximum frame times degrading, all three gifs have an average frame rate of 15fps. In the leftmost animation, every frame is 67ms. In the center animation, most frames are 33ms, but every sixth frame is 200ms long. In the right animation, most frames are 33ms, but every eleventh frame is 367ms long.</p><p>Despite one metric staying constant, the other degrades enough to make the path of the ball seem jarring.</p><p>In the next example, it’s the average frame time that degrades from left to right. Rather than switching between smoothness and hitching, a low average frame rate produces a choppy appearance.</p><figure><figcaption>Average frame times increase (from left to right) while maximum frame times stay the same</figcaption></figure><p>All three of these have a maximum frame time of 167ms, with most frames taking 33ms. In the left animation, however, the 167ms hitches happen every 28th frame. In the center animation, every 10th frame. In the right animation, every 4th frame.</p><p>In an ideal world, applications would never drop below 60fps. As we move towards that world, however, it’s helpful to monitor both of these metrics over time. We could instead look at a full histogram of frame times, but it would be difficult to chart our progress over time with so many variables.</p><h3 id="tracking-figma-s-average-and-maximum-frame-times"><a href="#tracking-figma-s-average-and-maximum-frame-times">Tracking Figma’s average and maximum frame times</a></h3><p>We measured our progress over the last 3 months for zooming and dragging in a complex document in terms of average and maximum frame times.</p><p>As you can see from the charts below, both zooming and dragging frame times decreased. For zooming in our benchmark document, we’ve maintained the necessary average frame time for 60fps and reduced the max frame time enough to avoid dropping any frames. For dragging, we improved the average frame from 30fps to 60fps, and reduced hitches from 120ms to 30ms, dropping a single frame instead of six during the hitch.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/90c20b9387f7e77ba902480bf6c797e091013e44-1600x354.png?rect=0,0,1600,353&amp;w=670&amp;h=148&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/90c20b9387f7e77ba902480bf6c797e091013e44-1600x354.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/90c20b9387f7e77ba902480bf6c797e091013e44-1600x354.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/90c20b9387f7e77ba902480bf6c797e091013e44-1600x354.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/90c20b9387f7e77ba902480bf6c797e091013e44-1600x354.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/90c20b9387f7e77ba902480bf6c797e091013e44-1600x354.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/749a7725276e6d99f39e36f11c4ed987ee12bb53-1600x349.png?w=670&amp;h=146&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/749a7725276e6d99f39e36f11c4ed987ee12bb53-1600x349.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/749a7725276e6d99f39e36f11c4ed987ee12bb53-1600x349.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/749a7725276e6d99f39e36f11c4ed987ee12bb53-1600x349.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/749a7725276e6d99f39e36f11c4ed987ee12bb53-1600x349.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/749a7725276e6d99f39e36f11c4ed987ee12bb53-1600x349.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50df51f2dddeee314ca2fe89b34233282b05fcf4-1600x357.png?rect=0,0,1600,356&amp;w=670&amp;h=149&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50df51f2dddeee314ca2fe89b34233282b05fcf4-1600x357.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50df51f2dddeee314ca2fe89b34233282b05fcf4-1600x357.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50df51f2dddeee314ca2fe89b34233282b05fcf4-1600x357.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50df51f2dddeee314ca2fe89b34233282b05fcf4-1600x357.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/50df51f2dddeee314ca2fe89b34233282b05fcf4-1600x357.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/245a2793037c5e8e05de5366b8f3a33f53579371-1600x350.png?rect=2,0,1595,350&amp;w=670&amp;h=147&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/245a2793037c5e8e05de5366b8f3a33f53579371-1600x350.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/245a2793037c5e8e05de5366b8f3a33f53579371-1600x350.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/245a2793037c5e8e05de5366b8f3a33f53579371-1600x350.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/245a2793037c5e8e05de5366b8f3a33f53579371-1600x350.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/245a2793037c5e8e05de5366b8f3a33f53579371-1600x350.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="behind-the-scenes-details-for-the-skeptics"><a href="#behind-the-scenes-details-for-the-skeptics">Behind the scenes: details for the skeptics</a></h2><p>To optimize Figma, we need benchmark tests that are consistent, but also realistic. To count as consistent, they must do exactly the same thing every time, so we can tell when performance improvements are the result of a code change versus a changing usage pattern. For them to be realistic, we need to be testing against real design files, not just files containing grids of 1000 gray rectangles. Making Figma really fast for unrealistic use cases isn’t terribly helpful to anyone 🙂.</p><p>To create consistent and realistic benchmarks, we run a version of our app in <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a> (basically a fancy wrapper around Chrome), and simulate user interactions like dragging, panning, zooming, selecting, and a few other key interactions. We measure how long we’re spending in key parts of the code (event processing, rendering, UI updating, etc.), and track those over time.</p><p>Once the benchmarks complete, the results are reported to <a href="https://www.datadoghq.com/">Datadog</a> where we set up alerts. These benchmarks run on every commit, so when performance regresses, we get email notifications and can tie the regression to specific code changes. Once we determine the source of the regression, we either fix the regression or undo the change until we can figure out a way of delivering the same functionality without the performance hit.</p><h2 id="what-s-coming-next-copy-paste-delete-undo-mirror"><a href="#what-s-coming-next-copy-paste-delete-undo-mirror">What’s coming next: copy, paste, delete, undo, Mirror improvements and more</a></h2><p>Of course, we’re not done here. We’re committed to making the experience of using Figma as fast as possible, and we want to focus on the areas affecting people most deeply.</p><p>While we’ve made strides on loading time, there’s still a lot of work to be done. We have a few major architectural changes underway that should yield huge benefits for loading time. The benefits will be especially pronounced for loading prototypes and working in the Figma Mirror app.</p><p>We’ve also recently rolled out changes to help us monitor operations that result in Figma locking up for more than 100ms, and have identified a few significant areas to start with: copy, paste, delete, undo, redo, and export.</p><p>Stay tuned!</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="w_oz4_C3Yfez" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><strong>Footnotes</strong></p><p>(1): <a href="https://blog.figma.com/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x-76f3f2395164">We announced this win last year</a>, but truly realizing it has been a journey involving discussion with the Chrome WebAssembly team, diving into their compiler source, finding workarounds to dodge compiler deadlocks, and contributing patches to Electron to backport Chrome GPU bug fixes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Welcome to a brand new editorial effort by Figma: Designer Q&amp;A. The first installment is with Gusto&#39;s Lead Illustrator Camellia Neri on 5 creativity catalysts</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to a brand new editorial effort by Figma: the Designer Q&amp;A! In our Catalyst Series we ask notable designers what sparks their creativity juices like a Vitamix set to 11.

Maybe you’re checking out a scene depicting the Serengeti: the lions, elephants, and zebras are all positioned in a story. A lion is eating a dead zebra and the elephants are cautiously watching. The diorama’s background is hand-painted in a color palette that represents the animals’ natural ecosystem. If it wasn’t for the formaldehyde it’s essentially a huge illustration.</p><p>These dioramas use the perfect color palette, lighting, and characters — dead animals in this case — to make for a fully packaged experience. I’m reminded of that attention to detail whenever I come across well-crafted landing pages with amazing storytelling, impactful visuals, and dynamic design in the exact same way.</p><h2 id="inspiration-4-the-partnership-of-quentin-blake"><a href="#inspiration-4-the-partnership-of-quentin-blake">Inspiration #4: The partnership of Quentin Blake and Roald Dahl</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6dd1f4eafb9512ca0f28dae17fdb9ec0781a764-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6dd1f4eafb9512ca0f28dae17fdb9ec0781a764-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6dd1f4eafb9512ca0f28dae17fdb9ec0781a764-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6dd1f4eafb9512ca0f28dae17fdb9ec0781a764-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6dd1f4eafb9512ca0f28dae17fdb9ec0781a764-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b6dd1f4eafb9512ca0f28dae17fdb9ec0781a764-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>When I finally moved out of my childhood home and began my life as an apartment-renting adult, I gave away all of my childhood books. All of them except for anything written by Roald Dahl and illustrated by Quentin Blake.</p><p>Quentin illustrated nearly all of Roald Dahl’s books, classics such as James and the Giant Peach, Matilda, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and my personal favorite, The Witches. While I loved Roald’s narrative whimsy, it was the pairing of Quentin’s illustrations that really sold the stories for me. Much like iconic film directors who consistently choose the same leading actors and actresses, it was the collective vision of both Roald and Quentin that brought to life the characters.</p><p>This is all to say that as an illustrator, the partnership you have with writers is comparable to a marriage. Choose yours wisely and when you find a good fit, make it a priority to nurture the relationship.</p><h2 id="inspiration-5-the-hidden-history-of-san-francisco"><a href="#inspiration-5-the-hidden-history-of-san-francisco">Inspiration #5: The hidden history of San Francisco</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/67c3f3e8d99e67ee1e9fb49608526d410cf36ef4-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/67c3f3e8d99e67ee1e9fb49608526d410cf36ef4-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/67c3f3e8d99e67ee1e9fb49608526d410cf36ef4-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/67c3f3e8d99e67ee1e9fb49608526d410cf36ef4-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/67c3f3e8d99e67ee1e9fb49608526d410cf36ef4-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/67c3f3e8d99e67ee1e9fb49608526d410cf36ef4-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>San Francisco is rich with hidden discoveries or nuggets (Gold Rush pun) of historical oddities.

      <title>Why transparent open design leads to happier clients</title>

      <description>Not sure where to start with building a culture of transparency in design? Citrusbyte sat down with us to share their approach and the role collaborative design software Figma plays.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever the craftsmen, designers are used to the lone wolf life. They perfect deliverables in secret until they’re ready for formal presentations.</p><p>But we’re entering a new era of design, and pioneers are forging far more transparent ways of working. Citrusbyte, a 90-person strategy, design and development firm based in Los Angeles, is one such leader. They value openness to such an extent that they share their raw, in-progress design files with clients. (I can practically hear all you perfectionists shuddering from afar.)</p><p>It’s not for moral reasons. The Citrusbyte team says that transparency benefits their business — resulting in more streamlined workflows, better project outcomes, and happier clients. It’s a big departure from the traditional culture of siloed design.</p><p>Citrusbyte’s unconventional approach has paid off handsomely. Since the company was founded in 2007, they’ve gone from working primarily with startups to now serving Fortune 1000 companies, including Apple, Caterpillar, Sony, Intel, AT&amp;T and the Brooklyn Nets. They help these giants transform legacy systems into more efficient software.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7c1b389917ec454b92a5f1ca4ab768a4b1db9fd-1600x889.png?rect=0,0,1600,888&amp;w=670&amp;h=372&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7c1b389917ec454b92a5f1ca4ab768a4b1db9fd-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7c1b389917ec454b92a5f1ca4ab768a4b1db9fd-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7c1b389917ec454b92a5f1ca4ab768a4b1db9fd-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7c1b389917ec454b92a5f1ca4ab768a4b1db9fd-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d7c1b389917ec454b92a5f1ca4ab768a4b1db9fd-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>A selection of Citrusbyte clients</figcaption></figure><p>Not sure where to start with building a culture of transparency in design? Citrusbyte sat down with us to share their approach and the role collaborative design software Figma plays.</p><h2 id="why-go-for-transparency"><a href="#why-go-for-transparency">Why go for transparency?</a></h2><p>From its earliest years, the Citrusbyte team placed a premium on transparency. They wanted clients to peruse projects often and follow the evolution of the work. Because design tools didn’t allow for that, Citrusbyte’s staff had to export and email files to customers, or sync to services like Dropbox and Google Drive.</p><div><blockquote><p>If we say we’re giving the client 100 percent transparency, but we’re using Sketch or Photoshop, then being 100 percent transparent is impossible, said Citrusbyte’s Design Manager Alex Zapadenko. The process influences the tools and the tools influence the process.</p></blockquote></div><figure><figcaption>Citrusbyte designers use Figma Multiplayer to work in a file at the same time</figcaption></figure><p>That all changed with Figma. Because our platform runs in the cloud, the design files are always up to date and can be shared with a link (which stays the same). Many people can be in a design file simultaneously and see the changes in real time.</p><p>&#34;I tell clients, You’ll get continuous design delivery from day one and it will be amazing, said Alex. You’ll go into a design file like it’s a room and walk around.&#34;</p><p>This accessibility eases clients’ nerves, according to Pablo Franco, a Citrusbyte designer. “There’s a feeling of security in a Figma project,” he said. “It’s not a closed environment where all the work I do is in a black box.”</p><p>Of course, that’s many designers’ worst nightmare — that a client, or manager, could check on a project in various states of disarray. They might misunderstand the messy stages of the creative process. But Citrusbyte deals with that issue through communication and expectation management. Pablo uses this metaphor with his clients: “You may want a bike, but if you peek in on me you’ll see me working on the chain.”</p><p>All this additional transparency ultimately benefits Citrusbyte. “When you bring the folks you’re working with directly into the project, you create a lot more buy-in,” said Adonya Ourshalimian, Client Partner at Citrusbyte. “There’s a much better understanding of what’s actually happening.”</p><h2 id="moving-faster-the-figma-way"><a href="#moving-faster-the-figma-way">Moving faster the Figma way</a></h2><p>Aside from just letting clients drop in on the work, Citrusbyte encourages them to give feedback throughout the design process. This was complicated before they found Figma. Sometimes they’d email clients PNGs or PDFs, and clients would email or Slack back responses. But there was no way of knowing what part of the design they were referring to.</p><div><blockquote><p>You had to write back, I don’t know what you’re talking about, Sam Small, another Citrusbyte designer, said. It was a lot more back and forth — wasted effort and time.</p></blockquote></div><p>In other situations, they’d use third party prototyping apps to share designs. “With tools like InVision, we would always have to save new versions as flat files and re-upload,” Sam said.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b303271484beef6665329efb3f7e99a1d499046c-1600x889.png?rect=0,0,1600,888&amp;w=670&amp;h=372&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b303271484beef6665329efb3f7e99a1d499046c-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b303271484beef6665329efb3f7e99a1d499046c-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b303271484beef6665329efb3f7e99a1d499046c-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b303271484beef6665329efb3f7e99a1d499046c-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b303271484beef6665329efb3f7e99a1d499046c-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Now, Citrusbyte uses Figma to reduce the inefficiencies. Since it’s web-based, there’s no need to re-upload files when designs change — the prototype always reflects the most current version. Clients can make changes themselves, like experimenting with different headline copy to see what feels best. “This decreases email chains revolving around small text tweaks,” said Sam. “It lets the designer focus on designing.”</p><p>For more formal reviews, Citrusbyte holds regular meetings with clients to go over progress — sometimes daily if it’s an aggressive timeline. “Before Figma, we’d spend a lot of time putting together this refined view, a nicely spruced up file with flow connectors,” Sam said.</p><p>Figma’s <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040318013">observation mode</a>, where users can click on a presenter’s avatar to follow their screen, cut out that hassle. The presenter can simply move around the design to demo it. “It saves a ton of time from that old process,” Sam said. “It’s night and day.”</p><p>Little features like this add up to big wins in productivity. Sam estimates he saves 30–50% time using Figma, compared to his previous workflow. “There’s just so many steps that have been removed,” he said.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?rect=0,0,1600,888&amp;w=670&amp;h=372&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1ec622ac6ecd0b15d05e899f8e822ceb191ff03c-1600x889.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The time savings helped Citrusbyte take on more work than they otherwise could have, and clients noticed. SundaySky, a video personalization and engagement provider, was impressed with Citrusbyte’s ability to hit a very aggressive deadline for them.</p><p>“If we look at the amount of time we spent designing other features, our review cycle time was cut in half using Figma due to the transparency and real-time collaboration tools,” SundaySky Product Director Megan Weil said. “It was a no-brainer decision to advocate for using Figma.”</p><p>An added bonus? Because Figma is an all-in-one design, prototyping, and developer handoff tool, Citrusbyte no longer needs to pay for a hodge-podge collection of other tools. “We save ~$20k/year,” Alex said.</p><h2 id="empowering-the-client"><a href="#empowering-the-client">Empowering the client</a></h2><p>Aside from just time savings, clients are thrilled by Citrusbyte’s open approach. Construction technology company Rouse Services hired Citrusbyte to build a mobile sales app. In previous projects, Product Manager Miles Wheelersburg constantly had to update internal stakeholders on his end.</p><p>In Figma, he could dive into Citrusbyte’s design files himself, so whenever people asked for updates on the project he could give them the information they needed without having to wait for Citrusbyte designers to send the latest version.</p><p>“To have the transparency there was key,” Miles said. “With other firms it was a black box as to where the designs physically came from.”</p><p>That’s exactly the trust that Citrusbyte wanted to engender in its clients. “What I love about Figma is not just the tool,” said Citrusbyte Design Manager Alex. “It’s the whole philosophy, the way of doing things that comes along with it.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>On the road: How two designers got rid of their hardware baggage</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/on-the-road-how-two-designers-got-rid-of-their-hardware-baggage/</link>
      <description>Edit Figma designs on a tablet with their simple Samsung set-up</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you hate carrying stuff for remote user testing, we have good news. With a simple Samsung mobile set up, you can run user research in Figma, direct your team and even do design work…all without an expensive laptop.</p><p>Here’s how it works. Snag:</p><ol><li>A Samsung S8, S8+, S9, or S9+ or Tab 2 tablet</li><li>Samsung’s DEX Dock (USB-C to HDMI converter) or Chromecast</li><li>A bluetooth keyboard &amp; mouse</li></ol><p>Then, wherever you are, broadcast your mobile Chrome browser on a monitor or television. You can navigate your Figma designs on your phone with your bluetooth keyboard and watch the frames change in real-time on the bigger screen.</p><p>Two Figma users, Josh Goodwin and Tyrale Bloomfield, pioneered this lightweight approach to UX after bonding over a mutual love of travel. “We have this constant pursuit to simplify everything: wallets, cars, chairs,” Tyrale said. “Our day-to-day UX process is one of those things.”</p><p>Josh lives mostly out of an RV and travels constantly in his work at a medical tech company. He used to have to lug bags of computers and tablets with him — each pre-loaded with Sketch or Adobe programs — so doctors could interact with designs in the context of the hardware they use.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e95f7d7e38731c782dedec8f53d5c2f20131efe-2000x1500.jpg?rect=1,0,1998,1500&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e95f7d7e38731c782dedec8f53d5c2f20131efe-2000x1500.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e95f7d7e38731c782dedec8f53d5c2f20131efe-2000x1500.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e95f7d7e38731c782dedec8f53d5c2f20131efe-2000x1500.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e95f7d7e38731c782dedec8f53d5c2f20131efe-2000x1500.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e95f7d7e38731c782dedec8f53d5c2f20131efe-2000x1500.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>But with Figma, Josh simply loads the design in his Chrome browser on his phone. He uses the DEX Dock or Chromecast to connect his phone to whatever free monitor the hospital has laying around. Then, he shares the prototyping URL with the doctors so they can see the designs on their own computers or tablets (they just open the prototype in their browser).</p><div><blockquote><p>With a Samsung Tab 2 tablet, a Chrome browser and a bluetooth mouse you can edit Figma designs on mobile</p></blockquote></div><p>As doctors give him feedback, he makes changes to the designs on the fly, watching the larger monitor to which he’s connected his phone. “It makes the dev team faster as well because they don’t have to wait for you to get home to design it,” Josh added.</p><p>In theory, this kind of setup isn’t just for user testing. It can also help designers on a budget. If you’re really strapped for cash — let’s say you’re coming right out of school, or you’re in an emerging country — you can buy one smartphone and a $100 TV, and design just as well as anyone with a $2000 MacBook.</p><p>“It lowers the entry point for designers,” Josh said. “As long as you’ve got access to a browser and the Internet you’ve got enough.”</p><div><blockquote><p>You can buy one smartphone and a $100 TV, and design just as well as anyone with a $2000 MacBook.</p></blockquote></div><p>On the other hand, Tyrale has found he can do his job as a creative director with a tablet alone — no monitor needed. He connects the bluetooth mouse to the Samsung Tab 2 and easily clicks around between Figma files. When his family takes trips to the beach, he ditches the mouse entirely and uses his fingers to leave comments by hand (while sitting in the sand). He likes that he doesn’t have to awkwardly balance a laptop on his lap or deal with glare in those moments.</p><p>“At that point you question, why do I have a laptop?” Tyrale explained. “You can use mobile to power the whole experience.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3328d8e53c6f025d63f98a44bf1ea7fbd1fe4bcb-2000x1500.jpg?rect=1,0,1998,1500&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3328d8e53c6f025d63f98a44bf1ea7fbd1fe4bcb-2000x1500.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3328d8e53c6f025d63f98a44bf1ea7fbd1fe4bcb-2000x1500.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3328d8e53c6f025d63f98a44bf1ea7fbd1fe4bcb-2000x1500.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3328d8e53c6f025d63f98a44bf1ea7fbd1fe4bcb-2000x1500.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3328d8e53c6f025d63f98a44bf1ea7fbd1fe4bcb-2000x1500.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Wondering if you could use other kinds of hardware besides Samsung? Josh and Tyrale said beware. They spent years testing different options — in some cases lurking at Best Buy, in others bumming tablets and phones off friends. Ultimately, Samsung offered the best option because of the way it handles display size. It changes the DPI when it broadcasts a phone onto a larger screen, so there’s more visual space in the projection, appropriate for the size of the display.</p><p>“These ones are as close to plug and play as you can get,” Tyrale said. “You can pull the device out of the box at the phone store and log into Figma and it’ll work.”</p><div><blockquote><p>At that point you question: Why do I have a laptop?</p></blockquote></div><p>The other key issue to consider in buying your mobile device is the way it interprets mouse clicks versus finger taps. For example, iPads interpret anything touching the screen as a finger. Android, depending on whether it’s Samsung, HTC, Nokia or Motorola, can sense the difference. If Figma thinks it’s receiving a finger touch all it will let you do is move objects around on the screen — not resize things, use the bounding box, or click and drag.</p><p>“We had to look for the right combination of hardware app and browser that could communicate mouse clicks to Figma,” Tyrale said. By the end of their hunt, they’d tested 30 browsers and countless phones.</p><p>“I can pick up anybody’s computer, anywhere in the country at any point in time, as long as you give me a browser with a cord and an input device, I can do my full job. That’s huge,” Tyrale said.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Learn how to tell your story authentically &amp; creatively</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It can be daunting to apply for your first product designer job. From navigating the wide variety of roles in the industry, to mastering the awkward dance of the in-person interview, there’s a lot to learn in a short period of time.</p><p>Your search for the perfect position hinges critically on one thing: Your portfolio. You need to represent your work in a way that’s both memorable and accurate, so it’s important to be thoughtful about what you focus on, especially for newcomers.</p><p>I worked with Figma and Skillshare to build <a href="https://www.skillshare.com/site/join?teacherRef=5773616&amp;utm_source=figma&amp;utm_medium=teacher-referral-partner&amp;utm_content=figma-0807&amp;t=Digital-Product-Design-Create-a-Compelling-Portfolio-Learn-with-Figma&amp;sku=531373984">a free online class</a> that will help you create your first portfolio and land that dream job.</p><h2 id="in-the-series-i-cover"><a href="#in-the-series-i-cover">In the series I cover:</a></h2><ol><li>What information to include in your portfolio.</li><li>How to design it visually.</li><li>What to consider when presenting your projects as case-studies.</li><li>How to tell your story throughout the application process, from your online presence to the actual job interview</li><li>How to iterate on portfolio designs and collaborate with peers using Figma. (You’ll learn how to invite a mentor into your project and get real-world feedback.)</li></ol><p>Product design is a moving target — it’s often a hybrid of different areas including research, user-experience, prototyping, user testing and visual design, to name a few. At many organizations, especially smaller companies or lean startups, designers can wear many hats. At others — often large enterprises — the product design team is broken up into specialized roles.</p><p>It’s important to determine where your strengths and interests lie so you can determine which of these specialties best suits you. As a newcomer to design, it’s easy to feel like an imposter lacking confidence, but keep in mind: Smart employers want talent who can adapt, because the industry’s tools, techniques and needs constantly change.</p><p>We hope users taking this course will learn how to approach their portfolio confidently and learn to highlight projects’ processes, learnings and outcomes (not just the polished end result).

      <title>Figma feature highlight: Observation Mode</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-feature-highlight-observation-mode/</link>
      <description>Did you know you can click on someone’s avatar to follow their screen activity?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At Figma we suspect some of our small (but mighty!) power features go unnoticed. In fact, after prodding our Twitter community this week, several users were surprised to learn we have a little something called <a href="https://help.figma.com/prototyping/presentation-view">“Observation Mode.”</a> We’re going to highlight more of these semi-secret use cases on the blog and figured Observation Mode was a good place to start.</p><div><blockquote><p>This feature is 🔥 for doing design critiques, getting feedback from clients and running user tests.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here’s the rundown: If more than one person is looking at a Figma file, then you can click on any face in the upper right hand corner. Similar to screen sharing, your screen will mirror everything they see on theirs. You’ll see each movement they make, from updating text in a frame to clicking their cursor on an object and expanding it. As you’d imagine, this feature is 🔥for doing design critiques, getting feedback from clients and running user tests.</p><p>Anyone can access observation mode in a Figma file as long as sharing for that particular file or project is enabled (even those with view only access). So, make sure you’re ok with being watched before you share a design URL.</p><div><blockquote><p>If sharing is enabled for that design file, anyone can use observation mode (even those with view-only access).</p></blockquote></div><p>There are many, many ways for a designer to wield this tool. Rather thanlisting them in all of their glory ourselves, we thought we’d “show” through our users’ tweets rather than “tell.”</p><h2 id="study-user-testing-in-real-time"><a href="#study-user-testing-in-real-time">Study user testing in real time</a></h2><p>Instead of gathering anecdotal evidence after the fact, simply click on a user’s avatar while they’re moving through a prototype in Figma. This way you’ll be able to see exactly where their pain points and hesitations occur.</p><h2 id="bypass-remote-communication-woes"><a href="#bypass-remote-communication-woes">Bypass remote communication woes</a></h2><p>As remote work <a href="https://blog.figma.com/how-to-hit-the-road-as-a-design-digital-nomad-c7cb9799735a">grows in popularity</a>, A/V issues become increasingly problematic. Our most common workaround, other than turning devices on/off, is to use Figma’s observation mode instead of screensharing on Google Hangouts. Call your co-worker via audio, observe their screen in Figma and voila! A near foolproof way to collaborate from afar.</p><h2 id="sync-stakeholders-on-internal-design-critiques"><a href="#sync-stakeholders-on-internal-design-critiques">Sync stakeholders on internal design critiques</a></h2><p>Rather than gesturing at a projector while Larry from Amsterdam tries to decipher what the heck you’re pointing at, in Observation Mode you can calmly walk all stakeholders through a design in real-time, regardless of their time zone.</p><h2 id="learn-the-patterns-of-your-students-pitfalls"><a href="#learn-the-patterns-of-your-students-pitfalls">Learn the patterns of your students’ pitfalls</a></h2><p>Did you know Figma is free for students? <a href="https://blog.figma.com/how-figma-transformed-this-berkeley-design-class-6c4b9586df45">When we spoke to Shana Hu</a>, a former TA for a UC Berkeley design class, she explained how Figma transformed her experience as an educator. “They could leave comments for students in context of the design, compared to previous tools, when they’d have to give feedback en masse over email or other applications.”</p><h2 id="assess-a-user-s-experience-by-observing-via-a-low"><a href="#assess-a-user-s-experience-by-observing-via-a-low">Assess a user’s experience by observing via a low-end monitor</a></h2><p>What better way to quality check than to literally see what a user sees?

But there are around twenty people contributing to our designs in some way, whether they’re commenting on our latest iterations, fixing copy, or designing cross platform features. Currently, our front end is designed in Sketch, as is Orbit, our design system. But since the mobile part of Orbit is visually different, we decided to try designing it in Figma and see how it works for us.</p><p>This post covers:</p><ol><li>Why we built our mobile design system in Figma</li><li>How the latest update changed the way we work</li><li>How we’ve organized our design system (with examples)</li></ol><p>Skip ahead to the 3rd section (“Our design library component principles”) if you’re already a Figma convert and just want inspiration on organizing components, handling version history and other housekeeping.</p><div><blockquote><p>Jump to “Component principles” if you’re already a Figma convert &amp; just want file organization/structuring ideas</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="why-figma"><a href="#why-figma">Why Figma?</a></h2><p>A Sketch-oriented workflow relies on tools like Zeplin to handle handoffs, Abstract to cover version control, and Marvel to design static prototypes. But, from time to time, things get out of sync. Prototypes get stuck on the latest tested iterations, people forget to push commits to Abstract, maybe Zeplin hasn’t been updated with the latest approved visuals, or the PNGs embedded in Dropbox Paper are 3 weeks old. These tools are, by design, bound to get out of sync 🤔.</p><p>Before I joined Kiwi.com, I was playing with the idea of trying Figma, but it was hard for me to get to it. I didn’t see much much value in using it, and I didn’t need to keep all my tools in sync.</p><p>I was also put off by the browser/cloud approach to it. I liked that I could fire up Sketch whenever I wanted, and it’s a native Mac app. And then it hit me, there’s no way around it — you either have everything in the cloud and it’s in sync 100% of the time, or you have things offline in desynchronized workflows. So, I tried working with Figma, just a little bit at first, and I liked it a lot.</p><p>Then I joined Kiwi.com last November. <a href="https://twitter.com/vojtarysanek">Vojta</a> was the only one working there on mobile at the time. He was covering all the platforms and all the devices by himself 👏. While he was doing a great job, his work lacked a consistent system behind it.</p><p>We wanted to try it, but betting on Figma without the whole team, and designing Orbit in it, seemed like a bad call. It wasn’t very clear what direction the Figma team would be heading in, and what they would focus on. Additionally, some of the features just weren’t quite ready. And yet, we decided to try it anyways, but with mobile only. Our front end and Orbit are still designed and maintained in Sketch.</p><div><blockquote><p>Then it hit me: You either have everything in sync 100% in the cloud, or you have things offline in desynchronized workflows.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="figma-3-0"><a href="#figma-3-0">Figma 3.0</a></h2><p>Until recently, managing components was a pain. Figma lacked the features to make the design system scalable. If you wanted to work with a DS efficiently, you were limited to a single file.</p><p>Fortunately Figma <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-3-0-217d6c248f85">introduced a huge 3.0 update</a>. I won’t go into much detail here (just <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-3-0-217d6c248f85">follow the link</a>), but basically the update:</p><ol><li>Made enabling, disabling, and managing updates easy</li><li>Enabled users to share components with overrides across files</li><li>Enabled users to share different styles for layers (which makes it more atomic than Sketch, as it enables you to combine text styles with colors and effects)</li></ol><h2 id="our-design-library-component-principles"><a href="#our-design-library-component-principles">Our design library component principles</a></h2><p>Whenever we design a new library component, or any other addition to the design system, we try to follow a couple of UX principles to ensure the library remains consistent, efficient and easy to work with.</p><h3 id="max-two-level-deep-component-nesting"><a href="#max-two-level-deep-component-nesting">Max two level deep component nesting</a></h3><p>Working with components and nesting them feels pretty powerful at first. By building components out at an atomic level (like icons) and assembling them into larger components (like status bars), you give yourself the flexibility to change one small piece of your system and watch it reflect in every part of your design. For those unfamiliar with the practice, <a href="https://blog.figma.com/component-architecture-in-figma-f16ae9cc4481">here’s a blog post</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHEh9HFBtFU">a tutorial video</a> that go into more detail.</p><div><blockquote><p>Going 2 levels deep in component nesting provides the best balance of usability and possibility.</p></blockquote></div><p>But as soon as you go more than a few layers deep — for example, let’s say you nest an icon component inside a status bar component, which itself is nested inside a home screen component — your process can get really confusing. With great power comes great responsibility, and I’ve found that going about <strong>2 levels deep in component nesting</strong> provides the best balance of usability and possibility. It’s a crucial guideline that keeps our design system manageable.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/02dbdfff0833a768fa092e6aab68e3349aafb921-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/02dbdfff0833a768fa092e6aab68e3349aafb921-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/02dbdfff0833a768fa092e6aab68e3349aafb921-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/02dbdfff0833a768fa092e6aab68e3349aafb921-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/02dbdfff0833a768fa092e6aab68e3349aafb921-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="make-it-easier-to-select-layers-especially-with"><a href="#make-it-easier-to-select-layers-especially-with">Make it easier to select layers (especially with text)</a></h3><p>To design quickly, you need techniques for manipulating layers and components. They often have invisible bounding boxes around them that can be tricky to nail (much like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitbox">the ‘hit box’ targets in FPS games</a>). For example, let’s say you create a standard component, with only a text label in it. By default, when you create a text layer in Figma the handles (dashed lines) surrounding it are small, wrapping the text nearly 1:1.</p><p>At Kiwi.com, we’ve gotten in the habit of automatically stretching those handles to the borders of the component. Then, we can double click almost anywhere in the component to edit the label.</p><p>You have to take a slightly different tact when you have two labels in a component. If you stretch both of these labels to the edges, they will overlap (and the handy ‘stretch to click’ technique no longer works). In this case, make one of the labels a bit smaller (I usually make it half the size), and push it to the top of the layer list in the left-hand panel. Then, you have a convenient way to double click and edit both layers, either by clicking the large one on the canvas itself, or by clicking smaller one in the layers panel.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f5ff9a4deefa2c97b4d8ef3cdaf0aa67cbcf8f-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f5ff9a4deefa2c97b4d8ef3cdaf0aa67cbcf8f-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f5ff9a4deefa2c97b4d8ef3cdaf0aa67cbcf8f-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f5ff9a4deefa2c97b4d8ef3cdaf0aa67cbcf8f-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b2f5ff9a4deefa2c97b4d8ef3cdaf0aa67cbcf8f-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="component-override-logic"><a href="#component-override-logic">Component override logic</a></h3><p>Component override suggestions are based on the size of the components. So, when you want to replace a component with something else, and you want to select it from the suggestions window, it needs to be the same size.</p><h3 id="groupit-protip"><a href="#groupit-protip">GroupIt ProTip™</a></h3><p>We wrap all of our components in groups. This way they don’t clutter the sidebar in the file components library. This makes working with pages with lots of components far easier. It’s something I miss in Sketch quite a lot.</p><h3 id="optimise-bitmap-assets"><a href="#optimise-bitmap-assets">Optimise bitmap assets</a></h3><p>When working with photos or any other bitmaps in our designs, we work with them as we would if they would be web assets.</p><ul><li><strong>We optimize the images:</strong> with tools like ImageOptim, Optimage, tinyPNG and such. I’m not sure if Figma does any optimization, but we do it anyways.</li><li><strong>We optimize the file format:</strong> PNGs for simple illustrations and JPEGs for photos.</li><li><strong>We resize the assets:</strong> We generally don’t need a billboard sized photos in our mockups.</li></ul><p>Following this practice improves the download time of our files and library components. It also makes reopening files less of a hassle.</p><h2 id="components-and-project-structure"><a href="#components-and-project-structure">Components and project structure</a></h2><p>In addition to our guidelines on building components, we’ve also created organizational structure for projects, versions and files. I’ve recreated the following examples so you can easily use them yourself. Just copy them, and feel free to adapt them to your workflow.</p><h3 id="project-cover"><a href="#project-cover">Project cover</a></h3><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dff3322532703a1e2b67edf88c692c60a316754-1026x489.png?rect=0,0,1026,488&amp;w=670&amp;h=319&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dff3322532703a1e2b67edf88c692c60a316754-1026x489.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dff3322532703a1e2b67edf88c692c60a316754-1026x489.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dff3322532703a1e2b67edf88c692c60a316754-1026x489.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dff3322532703a1e2b67edf88c692c60a316754-1026x489.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0dff3322532703a1e2b67edf88c692c60a316754-1026x489.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1026w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>It might seem like a little thing, but navigating through Figma can be a pain when you have lots of files and projects. File titles work, but it is hard to scan them fast. That is why we use cover images.</p><h3 id="project-file-structure"><a href="#project-file-structure">Project file structure</a></h3><p>We stick with one file per project or flow (we have files for things like place picker, date picker, search and similar). We chose this solution because we found that having many user flows in one file makes it slow to load.</p><p>One drawback — You cannot connect two files and create a prototype from them in Figma. So, with flows separated between files, we can’t test certain user behavior (like going from the booking flow to their profile information).</p><h3 id="project-versioning"><a href="#project-versioning">Project versioning</a></h3><p>We use pages as different versions of the project with a standard XY naming convention. X represents huge version updates, while Y smaller iterations, with the latest iteration on top. The components page hosts component candidates which we consider moving to the main UI library.</p><h3 id="tokens"><a href="#tokens">Tokens</a></h3><p>This file is rarely touched. It contains the most atomic components of the entire design system. The file has three pages: colors, typography, and shadows. Basically everything you can define in Figma Libraries, except for components.</p><p><strong>Tokens — Colors</strong></p><p><strong>Tokens — Typography</strong></p><p>Typography is the same as colors. We’ve already defined everything we need in our design system (it is missing some FE font style definitions), and thus is rarely touched. The typography defined above seems rather simple, but when combined with other shared styles, it’s everything we need on mobile.</p><p><strong>Tokens — Shadows</strong></p><p>Shadows are something we’re still experimenting with, but so far we’ve defined 4 elevation levels, and this seems to work well for us.</p><h3 id="icons"><a href="#icons">Icons</a></h3><p>Icons have their own page, they are all split into different sections, and are placed in 24x24 frames. Almost all the icons are standard <a href="https://material.io/tools/icons/">Material Design Icons</a>.</p><h3 id="illustrations"><a href="#illustrations">Illustrations</a></h3><p>Illustrations are very similar to icons. It’s just a huge canvas full of our product illustrations. They all share the same size. But due to some import limitations of SVG to Figma, we have to work with bitmaps for now.</p><h2 id="orbit-mobile"><a href="#orbit-mobile">Orbit Mobile</a></h2><p>Initially we had two different mobile libraries for iOS and Android. But since they overlap a lot, we’ve decided to combine them. It’s easier for us to maintain it this way. But differences in the presentation of some of the UI elements remain, for example switches and such. This is still a work in progress, and we need to catch up with Android a little bit 🙂.</p><h2 id="the-naysayer-eats-his-words"><a href="#the-naysayer-eats-his-words">The naysayer eats his words</a></h2><p>Figma lacked in features <a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-3-0-217d6c248f85">before the 3.0 release</a>, but now they’ve added most of my must-haves, and it’s become a serious competitor to other tools. Building a design system with it proved to be relatively easy. Actually, I feel like managing it in Figma is far easier than it other tools. It is by no means perfect, but it fits my taste the most.</p><p>The way we structure our files and split the design system logic is constantly evolving with every update, but the things mentioned in this post have stuck with us the longest and proven effective.</p><p>In future posts I would like to cover how to actually build a design system in Figma, some of the gotchas behind working with nested components, and some other tips. If this is something right up your alley, the safest way to know about it once it’s out is to follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/rojcyk">Twitter</a> 🐧.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Much like cultures and countries, professional industries have their own unique languages. Specialized terminology gives experts a way to define and discuss their work, but it can also intimidate and confuse new entrants to the field.</p><p>Design has a particularly dense vocabulary, forged through a long history of art, printmaking, and publishing. As in other areas, designers are hyper focused on the details, resulting in an array of terms for everything from usability to typography.</p><p>Today, we’re excited to share a new resource for learning all this design-related jargon—our <a href="https://www.figma.com/dictionary/">Design Dictionary</a>. Whether you’re just getting started as a designer or you work alongside them, we hope you can use this glossary to master the basics.</p><p>In the golden era of digital interfaces, everyone across an organization touches design. Engineers turn designs into production ready code, copy editors add language to frames, stakeholders approve designs, product managers conduct the whole shebang. It’s difficult for people in these roles to work cross-functionally if they aren’t speaking the same language.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e55bc570e934c67cae33c5496736352b5dc9682-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e55bc570e934c67cae33c5496736352b5dc9682-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e55bc570e934c67cae33c5496736352b5dc9682-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e55bc570e934c67cae33c5496736352b5dc9682-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e55bc570e934c67cae33c5496736352b5dc9682-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e55bc570e934c67cae33c5496736352b5dc9682-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>We saw this first hand at Figma after hiring staff from a wide range of specialties — business, analytics, support, engineering and more — who didn’t necessarily have backgrounds in design.</p><p>To strengthen communication, we built this dictionary. It’s a work in progress — we’re launching with 70 terms — but we decided to open source it for the community in case others find it useful. We plan to expand it as time goes on (and the industry evolves).</p><p>To build a truly comprehensive resource, we need your help: What terms have made design collaboration challenging on your team? Are there certain words (like White Space, Stroke, or Lorem Ipsum) that contribute to extra confusion?

Mike went to a friend’s movie club, where people quietly watched a film together and then discussed it afterwards. That format provided a simple constraint for intelligent discourse.</p><p>Feeling inspired, Mike decided to apply a similar framework to his own passion: music.</p><p>He felt like his life was missing a communal listening experience. He wanted to cut out distractions (digital or human), create an intentional environment of reflection and provide an opportunity to truly listen.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e807790321aab2ff00930f4c12ae016aa4709349-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e807790321aab2ff00930f4c12ae016aa4709349-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e807790321aab2ff00930f4c12ae016aa4709349-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e807790321aab2ff00930f4c12ae016aa4709349-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e807790321aab2ff00930f4c12ae016aa4709349-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e807790321aab2ff00930f4c12ae016aa4709349-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Sketch drawn by Sarah Klearman while listening to Cornelius’ “Mellow Waves” LP   </figcaption></figure><p> <br/> Flash forward several months, and Mike hosts Art of Listening (AoL for short). People sit in a living room and listen to an album from start to finish with one rule: Stay quiet and pay attention. That means no talking, checking your phone for a new Tinder match, or showing up late. What you can do is doodle, write down memories surfaced by the music, or sit back with your eyes closed and let sound waves wash over you. Afterwards, the group discusses their thoughts and people show off whatever they’ve sketched.</p><p>It may sound like a simple setup, but a ton of effort goes on behind the scenes. First, Mike has to find an artist who puts a lot of thought into the rhythm and narrative arc of their albums. Then Mike has to pour through interviews, b-sides, podcasts, Instagram posts, whatever he can get his hands on, and pull the most compelling content. Photos and juicy quotes rotate on a monitor while the participants listen, giving additional context to the album far above a distracted stream via Spotify</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/10acf0dc322774d45fd359eb17afd3fff9fc5858-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/10acf0dc322774d45fd359eb17afd3fff9fc5858-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/10acf0dc322774d45fd359eb17afd3fff9fc5858-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/10acf0dc322774d45fd359eb17afd3fff9fc5858-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/10acf0dc322774d45fd359eb17afd3fff9fc5858-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/10acf0dc322774d45fd359eb17afd3fff9fc5858-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p> <br/> So, how can this possibly relate to interface design? For Mike, this auditory, artistic side project refills his creative coffers, giving him energy for his visual, systematic work as an interface designer. He explains, “There’s an attraction for designers to the analogue or offline world. Many shoot film cameras or learn how to do letterpress and binding.” Designers crave a reprieve from screens, a break from being swallowed head-over-heels down the Internet rabbit hole.</p><p>“If you had asked me a year ago whether I thought I’d ever plan events, I would have said, ‘hell no,’” he admits. But that’s the thing about creative pursuits — sometimes they find you when you least expect them.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7afb807e88437e83a1d4377693fcd15140c788bd-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7afb807e88437e83a1d4377693fcd15140c788bd-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7afb807e88437e83a1d4377693fcd15140c788bd-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7afb807e88437e83a1d4377693fcd15140c788bd-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7afb807e88437e83a1d4377693fcd15140c788bd-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7afb807e88437e83a1d4377693fcd15140c788bd-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Desktop-based design can come with a hefty price. Teams spend their days managing a Frankenstein workflow: Which prototype has stakeholder comments? Is the style guide up to date? Are we all working from the right version of the design?</p><p>We think there’s a better way on the web. Today, <a href="https://www.figma.com/">I’m excited to introduce Figma 3.0</a>, with three features that — taken together — will allow companies of all sizes to consolidate their tool stack. This will save you time because you won’t need to constantly switch across apps. And it will save you money because you can remove redundant tools from your workflow.</p><h2 id="what-s-new"><a href="#what-s-new">What’s new:</a></h2><h3 id="prototyping"><a href="#prototyping">Prototyping — </a></h3><p> We’ve added device frames, fixed objects and advanced scrolling to bring your designs to life.</p><h3 id="styles"><a href="#styles">Styles — </a></h3><p>With Styles and our new Team Library functionality, you can now build and maintain every part of your company wide design system in Figma.</p><h3 id="organization-tier"><a href="#organization-tier">Organization tier — </a></h3><p>We’re previewing our new “Organization” tier, which helps large organizations scale their design management.</p><p>We hope this new functionality, coupled with our existing web-powered features like <a href="https://help.figma.com/editor/developer-handoff">Developer Handoff</a>, <a href="https://help.figma.com/editor/1322329-toolbar/comments">Commenting</a> and <a href="https://blog.figma.com/components-in-figma-e7e80fcf6fd2">Shared Components</a>, will allow you to switch your team and workflow 100% (or nearly 100% 😉) to Figma.</p><p>Read on for the details.</p><h2 id="prototyping"><a href="#prototyping">Prototyping</a></h2><p>With 3.0, prototyping in Figma has evolved. We listened carefully to our users over the past year and added things you need to get great feedback on your work: Device frames, fixed objects, scrolling and <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-prototyping-now-with-transitions/">transitions</a>.</p><p>Yes, this means your team can finally kiss your pricey InVision subscription — and its endless syncing — goodbye. Prototyping in Figma is free, and it’s tied to design so you never have to export screens again (web magic in action ✨).</p><h2 id="the-rundown"><a href="#the-rundown">The rundown:</a></h2><p><strong>Device frames</strong>. Add a range of containers — from iPhone to Android to Apple Watch — on your designs, and watch them shine. This will help others on your team gain context about the scale of the design.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7fca8a6303f2a200c903bd0ad4f214ca2d16dfec-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7fca8a6303f2a200c903bd0ad4f214ca2d16dfec-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7fca8a6303f2a200c903bd0ad4f214ca2d16dfec-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7fca8a6303f2a200c903bd0ad4f214ca2d16dfec-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7fca8a6303f2a200c903bd0ad4f214ca2d16dfec-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7fca8a6303f2a200c903bd0ad4f214ca2d16dfec-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><strong>2. Fixed objects</strong>. Our community has asked for fixed headers and footers in prototyping since the day we launched.

Scrollable areas.</strong> This is a whole new level of interaction for a screen design tool. You can enable scrolling through individual shapes within a parent frame, which can itself be scrollable. Want to introduce a carousel of images (ex: Netflix’s horizontal selection style)? Go for it! Need vertical lists? Add it. We went a little wild and even included ‘scroll in any direction.’</p><figure></figure><p><strong>4. Transitions.</strong> Add dissolve, slide and push effects to link frames. These subtle transitions mimic the motion of native mobile apps so your prototypes look professional.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf7b2d5f669106959e265dc6f6e086baff0b7cb-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf7b2d5f669106959e265dc6f6e086baff0b7cb-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf7b2d5f669106959e265dc6f6e086baff0b7cb-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf7b2d5f669106959e265dc6f6e086baff0b7cb-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf7b2d5f669106959e265dc6f6e086baff0b7cb-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1bf7b2d5f669106959e265dc6f6e086baff0b7cb-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Read more on how to enable this new functionality <a href="https://help.figma.com/prototyping/prototyping">in our help article</a> here or watch our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6DOO11zuA&amp;feature=youtu.be">tutorial video here</a>.

In Figma, the two are linked, so you don’t have to switch between tabs when incorporating feedback.</li><li><strong>TED TALK MODE 👩🏽‍🏫:</strong> Stroll the conference room like a TED talk pro by opening your prototype in your mobile browser. Use your phone as a remote to click through your presentation.</li></ul><figure></figure><p>Prototyping is a big surface area and we know some of you will still need other tools to do your work.

When new hires join their specific team in Figma, they’ll be able to access the appropriate materials from day one — no onboarding, software setup, permissions granting or other menial labor necessary.</li><li>Security: With Figma’s org tier, companies can enforce login restrictions like SAML, Google SSO, or two-factor authentication. They can also add guests to Figma, so people outside their organization — like contractors — can access specific projects without full membership.</li><li>Admin controls: Admins will be able to manage the above security features from a single centralized view. We’re also giving them improved visibility and control over org data, with audit logs and data export, to ensure a company never loses track of work.</li></ol><figure></figure><p>We want to get this right, so we’re partnering with a few select companies to perfect our offering.

Along the way, she’s learned some valuable lessons about building products that work well for everyone.</p><p>A report from <a href="https://www.interactiveaccessibility.com/accessibility-statistics">Interactive Accessibility</a> found that 57 million Americans are disabled, either by a physical or mental handicap, with 54% of that number active online. That’s 9.3% of the American population.</p><p>Do you really want to miss out on 10% of that prospective user base?</p><p>“Designers have this notion that accessibility means terrible constraints that will make your UI shitty,” she tells us. “But actually, how shitty is it to leave out an entire population?”</p><p>To build an app for everyone, you have to prioritize accessibility from the start. Cat’s working on three apps doing just that: <a href="https://twitter.com/lyraapp">Lyra</a>, a symbol to speech app for autistic children; <a href="https://www.getiris.co/">Iris Health</a>, a modern day critical health service; and <a href="https://www.getstark.co/">Stark</a>, a design tool for color-blind simulation and color-blind contrast.</p><p>Here’s a peek into her projects along with tips on how to include as many users as possible.</p><h2 id="iris-health-a-modern-day-critical-health-service"><a href="#iris-health-a-modern-day-critical-health-service">Iris Health: a modern day critical health service</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2271323c6549194a2a3dc61893d5b0cf3b053dcb-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2271323c6549194a2a3dc61893d5b0cf3b053dcb-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2271323c6549194a2a3dc61893d5b0cf3b053dcb-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2271323c6549194a2a3dc61893d5b0cf3b053dcb-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2271323c6549194a2a3dc61893d5b0cf3b053dcb-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The idea for Iris Health came to Cat while she was driving through southwest Germany with her boyfriend (now husband) Ben. She looked at him and said, “‘Dude, if we get into a car accident, I’m SOL. We’re not married, so my health proxy is back in the US, and without that they know next to nothing about me. What am I allergic to? How has my health been recently? What’s my blood type? Am I diabetic?’”</p><p>The idea took hold. She decided to build an app to help save the life of anyone too incapacitated to speak for themselves, a service that’s just as useful for the chronically ill as it is for expats. Two years later and Iris Health is now fully operational.</p><p>If Iris Health detects that you’re located at a hospital, then it will ask if you’re OK. If it doesn’t receive a response within ten minutes, then it will alert your emergency contacts via text message. In addition to that, your personal health card will appear on your iPhone lock screen the way a boarding pass does — with a swipe, medical professionals can view important information such as name, medication, allergies and donor status (morbid, but useful.)</p><p><strong>Lesson learned</strong></p><p><em>Think about the user base from every angle. Spend a solid amount of time considering the different populations who might use your product and how you can adapt the UI to their needs.</em></p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1469d003dd21dfc56b0fc63cb1db13f2f5d217a-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1469d003dd21dfc56b0fc63cb1db13f2f5d217a-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1469d003dd21dfc56b0fc63cb1db13f2f5d217a-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1469d003dd21dfc56b0fc63cb1db13f2f5d217a-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d1469d003dd21dfc56b0fc63cb1db13f2f5d217a-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>As she attempted to build an app for the healthcare space, Cat realized there weren’t enough design tools supporting accessibility. It became apparent that the tech industry’s blind spot is anyone who doesn’t fit the mold of a “typical user,” whatever that means.</p><p>That’s how she came up with the concept for Stark, a color-blind simulator and contrast checker. The tool allows designers to simulate various forms of color blindness and check contrast by quickly selecting layers within Sketch (with more integrations soon to come :]). Then a designer can either select which form of color-blindness to simulate or view the contrast ratios for the typography against a background color.</p><p>Already Stark has racked up usage from teams at some heavyweight companies: Twitter, ESPN, Palantir, Dropbox and Microsoft.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned</strong></p><p><em>Embed tools into your workflow by default. Use accessibility tools like Stark, <a href="https://usecontrast.com/">Contrast</a>, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/">W3C checklist</a> to ensure you’re meeting the standards necessary. These services will analyze your design and tell you what’s missing from an accessibility standpoint. Typefaces like <a href="https://www.thisiscolossal.com/2018/04/braille-neue-combines-braille-and-visible-characters/%29">Braille Neue</a> are a cool way to address the visual and tactile needs of those with sight as well as those without.</em></p><h2 id="lyra-the-symbol-to-speech-app-for-autistic"><a href="#lyra-the-symbol-to-speech-app-for-autistic">Lyra: the symbol to speech app for autistic children</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/be3902828307f64bd9813cb9879620f85a5274ff-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/be3902828307f64bd9813cb9879620f85a5274ff-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/be3902828307f64bd9813cb9879620f85a5274ff-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/be3902828307f64bd9813cb9879620f85a5274ff-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/be3902828307f64bd9813cb9879620f85a5274ff-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>What if you could help autistic children communicate more effectively? That’s the question Cat asked herself after working with autistic children while in college. Back then she wanted to be a pediatric neurologist and worked with children with all different types of special needs — from autism to cerebral palsy, to a variety of behavioral challenges. These experiences serve as the backbone for why she cares so much about accessibility, and the reason for why she built Lyra, a symbol-to-speech communication app for non-verbal autistic children.</p><p>The Delaware Autism program created a non-digital communication method for autistic children, involving laminated tabs on velcro straps, back in 1985. Over three decades later, that style now seems archaic and analogue; it inhibits them from living in the digital world like the rest of us. Cat and her team wants to modernize this communication style with Lyra.</p><p>Cat and her team plan on releasing the beta version of Lyra within the next few months.</p><p><strong>Lesson learned</strong></p><p>Educate yourself. Learn what makes for accessible design, so you know what pitfalls to watch out for. A great place to start is with<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/%29"> Microsoft’s Accessibility guide</a>. Not only is it beyond informative, it’s also beautiful designed.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can tag people in comments, mark comments as resolved, and even integrate with Slack.</li><li><a href="https://blog.figma.com/figma-2-0-now-with-prototyping-and-developer-handoff-1b309a5d025c">Developer Handoff</a>. Devs can get dimensions, styles, and download icons and images from the project URL. It’s like Zeplin, but again, you don’t have to sync your artboards whenever you update your designs.</li><li><a href="https://blog.figma.com/now-you-can-name-and-annotate-your-figma-version-history-250aa1b5caf5">Version Control</a>. Figma includes version history for all collaborators. You can roll back to or fork from a previous state. This works like time machine on a Mac.</li><li><a href="https://blog.figma.com/5-ways-to-use-figma-that-you-probably-never-thought-of-7711610d6061">Multiplayer Collaboration</a>. Multiple people can collaborate in real time. Similar to Freehand, we all see each other’s cursors on the screen and can draw things and make comments.</li><li><strong>Liveshare</strong>. If you click on someone’s avatar, you get to see what they’re seeing on their screen and follow their cursor around. This works just like InVision Liveshare (RIP Liveshare).</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@nspace/building-flexible-components-in-figma-41113aa69493">Components</a>. Similar to Symbols in Sketch, but more flexible and easier to design with. (More on this below)</li><li><a href="https://blog.figma.com/5-essential-ways-to-use-design-constraints-29fb21cbcf40">Constraints</a>. Similar to Resizing in Sketch, but more intuitive.</li><li><a href="https://blog.figma.com/team-library-1-0-d1427092323a">Team Libraries</a>. You can share and update collections of components across projects.</li><li><strong>Bonus</strong>: you can even embed Figma projects in Dropbox Paper.</li></ul><h2 id="now-let-s-get-to-the-really-good-stuff"><a href="#now-let-s-get-to-the-really-good-stuff">Now let’s get to the really good stuff…</a></h2><p>Figma covers all the bases with the features mentioned above. But it gets really interesting when you consider how it improves our workflow.</p><p>Below are four ways Figma can fundamentally improve how we work.</p><h2 id="_1-we-can-iterate-way-faster-with-real-time"><a href="#_1-we-can-iterate-way-faster-with-real-time">1. We can iterate WAY faster with real-time collaboration</a></h2><p>You can <a href="https://blog.figma.com/how-braintree-cut-time-spent-on-design-critiques-by-50-1ebc23061b74">do a design review</a>, make updates on the fly, and instantly get feedback on your changes. The time between iterations can go from days down to minutes because there is zero time wasted uploading or syncing screens, creating share links, messaging people to look at the links, and so on. When I experienced this first-hand it was so amazing that I shed a single tear of joy.</p><p>Below are some real-life scenarios that can make work slow and tedious at the best of times and incredibly frustrating at the worst of times. All of these scenarios go away by using Figma:</p><ul><li>When after syncing all your screens to InVision you realize you want to increase the font size slightly in a header component, so you make the change in your design file and then have to re-sync all the screens to InVision.</li><li>When you use Craft to sync a complex, multi-screen prototype to InVision and then need to spend what feels like an hour dragging and dropping the screens in the correct order in InVision because Craft uploads them in a random sequence.</li><li>When someone in another timezone forgets to commit or upload their work so you have to wait until they’re back online to get the latest designs.</li><li>When there’s a software update and all the 3rd-party plugins break and you lose hours.</li></ul><h2 id="_2-our-design-process-becomes-more-inclusive-and"><a href="#_2-our-design-process-becomes-more-inclusive-and">2. Our design process becomes more inclusive and seamless</a></h2><p>All of a sudden the design file becomes a venue where anyone can meet up and <a href="https://blog.figma.com/why-transparent-open-design-leads-to-happier-clients-aaf98a7cd50c">have a discussion about the designs</a>. This means that it’s easier for designers to work in parallel, exploring options and iterating in shorter increments. This means that developers can spot and voice technical concerns sooner rather than later. And this means that stakeholders, project managers, or anyone with the link can see how the design is unfolding from an idea to a polished visual, rather than waiting for a big reveal.</p><p>Instead of fragmenting the design process across multiple files, there is now one place that can tell the whole story and evolve as the design process unfolds.</p><p>I like what Thomas Lowry, a designer at OpenText, wrote about <a href="https://medium.com/@nspace/figma-is-transforming-my-entire-workflow-2ce2df2c12c2">how his design process has changed by using Figma</a>:</p><div><blockquote><p>As we begin to dive into a massive website project, Figma is quickly becoming an essential part of our process. We will produce our wireframing and low-fidelity prototypes in Figma all the way through to the the visual design phase. During this process we will begin establishing components and push them to the team library for use across many files. As we vet out the components in different scenarios, and the design evolves, being able to make modifications that are global across all files will be a huge time saver.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="_3-our-transition-from-design-to-code-is-likely"><a href="#_3-our-transition-from-design-to-code-is-likely">3. Our transition from design to code is likely to be faster and more consistent</a></h2><p>That’s because with Figma, it’s easier to structure our designs in a way that reflects how those designs will be coded.</p><p>To understand why, you need to know <a href="https://help.figma.com/drawing/tools/creating-groups-frames">how frames work</a>. Figma uses frames instead of artboards. Frames are different because you can nest frames inside a frame. When you place a smaller frame over a larger frame, the two frames are automatically grouped and the smaller frame becomes the child of the larger, parent frame. Children frames are <a href="https://blog.figma.com/5-essential-ways-to-use-design-constraints-29fb21cbcf40">positioned and constrained</a> relative to their parent. This is one of those things that takes some getting used to, but then once you do, you wonder how you ever did without it.</p><p>You can use frames to divide a screen into content areas and then nest components (which are themselves a bunch of nested frames) inside of those sections. This approach combined with auto-grouping, relative positioning, and constraints makes it easy to quickly build out consistent and responsive designs.</p><p>Using frames like this is helpful for developers because a frame in Figma is akin to a container in HTML. When developers inspect the designs, they’ll be able to see UI elements nested in their respective containers, which means they’ll have a more accurate blueprint to refer to as they write their code.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bacd7d021222e0f6bc34d3be8f4458cdc68e638e-800x561.png?w=670&amp;h=470&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bacd7d021222e0f6bc34d3be8f4458cdc68e638e-800x561.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bacd7d021222e0f6bc34d3be8f4458cdc68e638e-800x561.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bacd7d021222e0f6bc34d3be8f4458cdc68e638e-800x561.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bacd7d021222e0f6bc34d3be8f4458cdc68e638e-800x561.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="_4-our-design-systems-will-be-more-flexible-and"><a href="#_4-our-design-systems-will-be-more-flexible-and">4. Our design systems will be more flexible and easier to design with, which means we’ll save time and gain consistency across projects</a></h2><p>Sketch has Symbols and Figma has Components. The difference is that components are more flexible than symbols, which means we can do more with less of them, which means we’re more likely to actually use them instead of breaking them or starting from scratch.</p><h3 id="how-are-components-more-flexible-than-symbols"><a href="#how-are-components-more-flexible-than-symbols">How are components more flexible than symbols?</a></h3><p>In Sketch you can use Symbol Overrides to edit text or swap out nested symbols. But if you want to change anything else — say, text size, border weight, or background color — you’d have to Detach from Symbol and create a slightly different version of the same UI element. To solve this you can nest every variation in one symbol, but then you end up with an overrides panel from hell. With large projects and complex UIs, organizing and maintaining all the permutations quickly becomes untenable.</p><p>With Figma, you can <a href="https://blog.figma.com/components-in-figma-e7e80fcf6fd2">access and modify the properties of any layer in a component</a> without detaching it from the master. The same thing goes for nested components. Now whenever you change a property of a layer in the master component, those changes will only get propagated to instances for which that property hasn’t already been overridden.</p><p>I think these three gifs do a good job of visually describing how it works.</p><figure><figcaption>Create a component and then copy it to create two instances of the master.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Changes to the master component are instantly propagated to all of its instances.</figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption>Except that any overridden property will stay overridden, even when the master is changed.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="how-are-components-easier-to-design-with-than"><a href="#how-are-components-easier-to-design-with-than">How are components easier to design with than symbols?</a></h3><p>First of all, you don’t have to worry about a naming structure (i.e. Icons/Search) as you’re creating components. You can rename a master component later and it will update all instances — not the case in Sketch. And to create a category of components, just group them in a frame and name that frame whatever the category is. That means it’s easy to reorganize things later just by dragging components around. For me, this really reduced the cognitive overhead of both creating components and keeping track of them.</p><p>Second of all, accessing components in Figma is way easier than accessing symbols in Sketch. Once again you don’t have to think about a naming structure to navigate a nested menu of symbol names. Instead, <a href="https://blog.figma.com/team-libraries-in-figma-409fa5e20f7">you can find (and see!) components</a> as a list of thumbnails. To add a component to a screen or to swap an instance, just drag and drop to the canvas. Or you can copy-paste the master component to create a new instance — you can’t even do this in Sketch without creating a new symbol.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f667cbe6322d5408de310599040852b0590d423-800x768.png?w=670&amp;h=643&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f667cbe6322d5408de310599040852b0590d423-800x768.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f667cbe6322d5408de310599040852b0590d423-800x768.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f667cbe6322d5408de310599040852b0590d423-800x768.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7f667cbe6322d5408de310599040852b0590d423-800x768.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>See and access components from a tab in the layers panel</figcaption></figure><p>Another thing that makes designing with components easier is that in Figma you can edit the master component in context of the larger view, rather than having to go to a separate page to make edits. I find it super annoying getting bounced to another page in Sketch every time I want to edit a symbol, then having to switch back to the design to see if my changes line up.</p><figure><figcaption>From https://blog.figma.com/components-in-figma-e7e80fcf6fd2</figcaption></figure><h2 id="wrapping-up"><a href="#wrapping-up">Wrapping up</a></h2><p>The more I use Figma, the more reasons I find to like it. There are a ton of details you end up discovering as you start working with it. Overall it feels like a more evolved and well-thought-out tool for interface design.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How one designer finds inspiration in rabble rousers like Bart Simpson</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-one-designer-finds-inspiration-in-rabble-rousers-like-bart-simpson/</link>
      <description>Welcome to our second edition of the Catalysts for Creativity Series where we ask notable designers what sparks their creative juices.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to our second edition of the Catalysts for Creativity Series where we ask notable designers what sparks their creative juices. Their chosen muses can be anything or anyone: graffiti, a short film, architecture, even a moment in history.</p><p>Our second subject in the series, Linda Eliasen, is currently the Head of Design at Help Scout. She’s spent her career as an intern for adult swim, an illustrator for MailChimp, and as the first designer at Dropbox to work on Dropbox Paper. And she also had a hand in creating this wonderfully weird recruiting video for Dropbox. She’s inspired by people who push the envelope — those rabble rousers of society, the outliers among the sheeple.</p><p>Linda was raised in the conservative town of Fayetteville, Georgia. Her creative and inquisitive personality didn’t mesh with the slow as molasses Southern town, so her sources of inspiration were particularly important for her growth as an artist. Each one opened a window to broader worlds, where women can break the rules, act goofy and strong, and even fart with their armpits. (We’re looking at you, Bartman.) As she grew up, her inspirations grew with her, replacing touchstones like religion with new sources of fantastical magic, like science. Later she would find reconciliation with her small town upbringing through William Eggleston’s unabashed photography, and a bet between two directors would teach her to shut up and get work done.</p><p>We’ll let Linda take it from here. 💃</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de1cca015de9fe67047fcb89dd44eaffb0d15f0b-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de1cca015de9fe67047fcb89dd44eaffb0d15f0b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de1cca015de9fe67047fcb89dd44eaffb0d15f0b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de1cca015de9fe67047fcb89dd44eaffb0d15f0b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/de1cca015de9fe67047fcb89dd44eaffb0d15f0b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>I never know what to say when asked how I stay inspired. I mentally spin in circles and end up saying something cliche like “travel!” Because secretly, I worry about my sources of inspiration constantly. I want to know how everyone else stays inspired, because I’m basically dead inside. What happened to the teenage spark? I vaguely remember what it was like to be 19 and out of breath because I was learning Color Theory for the first time and it was FASCINATING.</p><p>Everyone has their own sources of inspiration, I guess. Historically, people have considered Inspiration as an almost otherworldly inhabitation of the human mind, in which a vessel is possessed by a creative entity. Literal magic. Ghost stuff. And it’s never up to the Artist to decide when they will be inspired. They simply arrive at their desk and stay long enough to feel Inspiration’s grasp. I love that. It lets the artist separate their ego from their ideas. If their ‘inspired’ work is received well, it’s thanks to the Ghost of Inspiration. This way they stay grounded. And if the thing fails miserably then they’re still protected, because apparently the Ghost wasn’t on their A-game that day.</p><p>Anyway, below are five of the things that have shaped my work-in-progress self.</p><h2 id="inspiration-1-bart-simpson"><a href="#inspiration-1-bart-simpson">Inspiration #1: Bart Simpson</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/86a06da35bc31c533544b7493ea5e3a0733c514d-1280x720.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1280w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Bart Simpson inspired me to wonder what life would look like if I didn’t obey all the rules.</p><p>When I was young, I was a shy and quiet rule follower. A total cry-baby mama’s girl. I just wanted to obey my parents and make sure everyone was happy all the time. If a cartoon character defined me, it would be Bobby Hill from King of the Hill. Like a Saltine with arms and legs.</p><p>But then in the 3rd grade I started watching the Simpsons and I fell in love with Bart Simpson, my alter-ego. He was brave enough to stand up to his own parents, to The Law aka Chief Wiggum, and to the bullies in school. A rebel with no cause, a skater boy, a total jerk that you secretly get behind him because he’s doing and saying all of the things you secretly want to say and do. He was my first bad boy crush.</p><p>I eventually found out that Bart was voiced by a woman, Nancy Cartwright, which made me like Bartman even more. I don’t know why, but I think it has something to do with the fact that this very male figure was being played by a woman — I liked the disguise of that. Was she acting totally in jest? Was she taking jabs at masculinity and narcissism?</p><h2 id="inspiration-2-the-ladies-of-snl"><a href="#inspiration-2-the-ladies-of-snl">Inspiration #2: The ladies of SNL</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/99f676a1a9ba93c9e1debddf183ea1bebd002bad-1254x668.jpg?w=670&amp;h=357&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/99f676a1a9ba93c9e1debddf183ea1bebd002bad-1254x668.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/99f676a1a9ba93c9e1debddf183ea1bebd002bad-1254x668.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/99f676a1a9ba93c9e1debddf183ea1bebd002bad-1254x668.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/99f676a1a9ba93c9e1debddf183ea1bebd002bad-1254x668.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/99f676a1a9ba93c9e1debddf183ea1bebd002bad-1254x668.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1254w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The ladies of SNL taught me that I could be funny and weird, and smell bad sometimes and play pretend and have a big imagination, and still have a place center stage, along with the men.</p><p>When I was growing up in Fayetteville, Georgia, it was tough finding female role models. I wanted to be funny and play sports and design buildings and go to the moon, and I had very little access to women doing any of that.</p><p>The message I received was this: women could become animal doctors or farmers’ wives or be rescued by a prince somehow. But that didn’t happen very often, so you should just become a teacher or something, because they let girls do that.</p><p>And if you do want a decent life, just make sure you’re pretty. And charming. And polite. And skinny. And pretty. And smile a lot. And don’t sweat too much. And don’t swear, or hold opinions, or make inappropriate jokes. Especially don’t fart with your armpit. And be very pretty.</p><p>Then I discovered Saturday Night Live. At the time, Cheri Oteri was my favorite cast member. This started to inspire me in a whole new way. Along with Cheri, women like Molly Shannon, Maya Rudolph, Tina Fey, Kristen Wiig and Amy Poehler put on ridiculous outfits, made themselves look horrendous, acted like idiots and played extremely unique and imaginative characters — far from the polite skinny princesses most girls were raised to become. That show inspired the hell out of me, and made me feel like I didn’t have to just be “the pretty girl” to have a great life.</p><h2 id="inspiration-3-carl-sagan"><a href="#inspiration-3-carl-sagan">Inspiration #3: Carl Sagan</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/03b41d295aa26acf2cfc41446ef333bf77740975-890x501.jpg?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/03b41d295aa26acf2cfc41446ef333bf77740975-890x501.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/03b41d295aa26acf2cfc41446ef333bf77740975-890x501.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/03b41d295aa26acf2cfc41446ef333bf77740975-890x501.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/03b41d295aa26acf2cfc41446ef333bf77740975-890x501.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 890w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The work of Sagan pushed my mind in new directions, and my work took on more technical qualities as an effect. It felt as if new life was being breathed into everything I made, and I owed it all to this beautiful weirdo who had long since left the Earth.</p><p>I’m pretty sure Carl Sagan was an alien. But nonetheless, he inspired me so much when I first started my career. I found a few essays he had written, and the first time I read them I was moved to tears. I realized that I didn’t know very much about the Universe or how Outer Space worked thanks to my Creationist upbringing.</p><p>Sagan’s writing was so affecting it led me to sign up for a free, online Astrophysics class offered through Yale. I drifted away from religion and became hungry for knowledge. I started to see that my shy and sheltered upbringing kept me far away from so many beautiful things I’d never seen before. I wasn’t angry with this realization; I was more “inspired” than ever to know that this world was STILL filled with fantastic new things to learn about, even halfway through my twenties. And the way that he speaks about humanity and civilization is just soul crushing.

The eating of this shoe, and the speech he gave before doing so, really inspired me to shut up and get to work.</p><p>After college, I was feeling a little burnt out. I did some only-okay work for a year or so, and I wondered if I had lost touch with inspiration. I started watching all sorts of films, British comedies, Kubrick, and the work of Werner Herzog, searching for that magical feeling.</p><p>Herzog had a friend named Errol Morris who, like most of us, had that side project he was always talking about but never got around to doing: he wanted to make a film about a pet cemetery. Herzog bet Morris that he would never actually make the film, telling him that if he did, he would <em>literally</em> eat his own shoe.</p><p>Morris was so inspired by Herzog’s challenge that he got to work, doing whatever he had to do to get the film finished. After years of development, he released Gates of Heaven, which in 1991 Roger Ebert named one of the 10 best movies of all time.</p><p>The first time I saw the digestion-churning documentary (where Herzog does, in fact, eat Morris’ shoe), it pushed me past a point in Mailchimp where I had felt stale and stuck. In the end I decided to leave Mailchimp for a new challenge, but not before designing one last thing, this inspirational coaster for a food blogging event. The video reminds me to keep making, keep making, keep making. You have to do something hundreds of times before you’re any good at it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>With websites, what comes first: The copy or design?</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/with-websites-what-comes-first-the-copy-or-design/</link>
      <description>Poll any marketer and they’ll tell you website projects rank up there with root canals and visiting the DMV.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Poll any marketer and they’ll tell you website projects rank up there with root canals and visiting the DMV. The end result is (mostly) great, but the process to get there is excruciating.</p><p>In my career, I’ve overseen countless website projects — from microsites, to landing pages, to net new website launches and major redesigns. No matter the size of the project, I always struggle with the exchange between design and copy. The two are inextricably linked in the ultimate chicken egg quandary. And because there’s so many siloed tools involved, the experience can feel like a black box (even for the project manager).</p><p>There’s a better way! Much like Google Slides eased the pain of creating presentations collaboratively, cloud-based design tools solve the “who’s on first” problem of copy and design. When multiple people from design and marketing can work in a design at the same time, it transforms the experience of creating a web asset.</p><h2 id="trapped-in-a-corporate-version-of-groundhog-day"><a href="#trapped-in-a-corporate-version-of-groundhog-day">Trapped in a corporate version of Groundhog Day</a></h2><p>I discovered this 9 months ago, when I joined browser-based design tool Figma as head of product marketing. When we decided to add some new pages to our website, I geared myself up for a world of hurt.</p><p>In previous roles, I’d spend weeks, sometimes months playing ping pong with the design team to build net-new website pages. I’d write copy in Google Docs, they’d design in Sketch, and we’d realize the copy didn’t fit. We’d try again for a second round, but then a design critique or a copy review would change everything. Once other stakeholders got involved — as they inevitably do — it would turn into a cluster.</p><p>At one company, most of our designers were remote. Our back and forth would get so crazy I’d wind up printing out the website designs, manually writing my edits on them with a pen, and scanning these marked up documents — yes scanning! — to share back with the team. It was like being trapped in a corporate version of Groundhog Day.</p><p>Figma was a different story and a much more pleasant one.</p><h2 id="here-s-how-the-website-project-went-using-figma"><a href="#here-s-how-the-website-project-went-using-figma">Here’s how the website project went using Figma:</a></h2><p>I scoped out the main copy points I want to make for each page in one Google doc<br/>The design team created a project in Figma with frames for each website page<br/>We worked together — often simultaneously — to go from high fidelity wireframe to final design<br/>No endless cycles between design and copy. No waiting days or weeks to get designs back before I could iterate on the text. No need to export or email designs to stakeholders. No scrambling to update last minute tweaks right before a milestone review.</p><p>You can imagine the time this saves and the frustration it averts.</p><p>With Figma, I can instantly see if the copy is too long or short in the context of the design and keep updating it without bothering the design team. The designers can focus on the actual design instead of managing the communication caused by a siloed tool chain. And the stakeholders can always see the latest design/copy, leave comments and access version history via the project’s URL. Better yet, we also use this URL to run user tests, so everyone involved can see the customer feedback. Having everyone and everything in one place is truly game changing.</p><p>While using Figma doesn’t replace every web project meeting, we have way less of them, and we run them far more efficiently. The result? I no longer cringe when I hear the phrase “let’s update the website” and instead get excited to use Figma the way some of our users do. With our free tier you can check out Figma yourself to see if it could work for you.</p><p>Do you have a great web use case for Figma? We’d love to hear it.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Are you passionate about the intersection of tech and design? We’re always recruiting! Visit our Careers page for the full listing.</p><p>Here at Figma we have a much loved tradition called “3 things.” It goes something like this: Once a new Figmate has been around the office for a few months, they present three things that made them who they are at a company all-hands meeting. Their chosen trio can be anything — family members, a moment in time that struck them, or even their collection of sneakers (yes, that was one designer’s “thing”).</p><p>Our Show and Tells offer glimpses into the wide-ranging backgrounds of people at Figma. A few fun facts that have emerged: Our head of support previously ran a record store. One of our engineers oversaw the animatronic effects in the 1995 film Babe. And our communications designer was born in Cairo.</p><p>We wanted to share these quick vignettes with the outside world to give you a peek at the human faces powering Figma. First up? Kathryn Salant. Her three things — music, programming and cycling — speak to her love for incremental, measurable progress. Each task’s problem has a solution; songs (or code) that fall flat can be fixed with enough iteration.</p><p>Kathryn is a software engineer on the Organizations team who has been with us for two years — nearly an eternity in startup time. In a past life she was a trumpet player for the orchestral anarchist band Extra Action Marching Band. David Byrne (of Talking Heads fame) was a fan of their frenetic playing and invited them on tour as his closing act.

For college she scored a full-ride scholarship to University of Wisconsin-Madison, spent a year at the London College of Music, and returned to Minnesota to study with her original teacher.</p><p>But by the end of college she was disillusioned with the classical music world — many of her classmates were narrowly focused on technical perfection and less interested in the inspiration and meaning behind the music they were playing. This was the point in her life where she fell in love with the arts and creativity — something that would eventually lead her to Figma.</p><p>Afterwards she moved to San Francisco and met The Extra Action Marching Band, a huge troupe of eccentrics who would crash parties with their avant garde orchestra. She signed on as a trumpet player in 2003, closed for David Byrne at The Fillmore, and even covered Beyonce’s “Crazy In Love” onstage with him. A later tour brought them to the South where they exclusively covered Black Sabbath with an Elvis impersonator in charge of Ozzy Osbourne’s vocals — suffice to say, the South was not amused with this interpretation.</p><h2 id="thing-2-programming"><a href="#thing-2-programming">Thing 2: Programming</a></h2><p>Growing up in the small Midwestern town in the 90’s meant less access to computers; however, in the 6th grade Kathryn found herself in a class filled with Apple IIEs. The teacher taught everyone basic programming skills in Logo and she built a Super Mario demo that was so realistic the rest of the kids thought she was playing the actual game.</p><p>The tinkering obsession continued into junior high. She would both fix and break her mom’s work computer by seeing how it was put together, often erasing important system files and then having to reinstall the OS.</p><p>Later, while at University, Kathryn filched a pirated copy of Flash 4 and installed it onto a computer in one of the music rooms. She was entranced by how Flash enabled, for the first time ever, motion graphics and interactivity on the Internet. The endless possibilities blew her away. She felt a kinship with this new intersection of tech and design: Flash attracted musicians, artists, and creative people. To the early aughts Silicon Valley programmers, code was the means to creative expression.</p><p>After exploring Flash at length, Kathryn knew she wanted to write code that enabled other people to create things. She loved working with talented designers whose ideas were begging to come to life. And they loved working with her because she respected design and did her best to implement their vision meticulously. Her passion for open communication between teams is in line with Figma’s mission of building a design tool that strives for the same.</p><h2 id="thing-3-cyclocross-racing"><a href="#thing-3-cyclocross-racing">Thing 3: CycloCross Racing</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?rect=1,0,1598,1200&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a468a53aaf702dcffbeb85836413d73824a37b8-1600x1200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>In addition to music and programming, Kathryn has fallen in love with cycling as an adult. It’s a strange irony for her because she admits to not being the most athletic while growing up.</p><p>San Francisco changed that mindset, starting with the AIDS/LifeCycle seven-day ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles — after that she was hooked on the empowerment that came from pushing her body’s endurance. In 2006 she combined her love for community building and cycling by founding Butterlap, a weekly bike ride through San Francisco with only two rules: 1) don’t be an asshole and 2) if you bring booze, bring the good stuff. It still exists today if you’re looking for a new route and some new friends.</p><p>Things intensified when she got into CycloCross, a community-oriented dirt (read: mud) race for cyclists. She participated in the Single Speed CycloCross World Championships in 2008, an adventure where she spent more time cheering for others than racing. For her, CycloCross is more about the experience and not taking yourself too seriously — it’s about the process and all of the other humans participating. Something we at Figma — the first collaborative design tool in the cloud — understand very well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Virta Health Figma Case Study</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we can monitor sleep, count our steps, record our heartbeat and even text our doctors — all with a click. Thanks to intuitive design, individuals are equipped to take ownership of their health unlike ever before.</p><p>When building experiences in healthcare, the stakes are higher. If your product fails, your patient fails — and that simple equation comes with risky outcomes. Designing for healthcare is complex — there are human lives on the line.</p><p>Meet Virta Health, the revolutionary company that delivers treatment for type 2 diabetes and other chronic metabolic diseases without medications or surgeries. This company is on a mission to reverse diabetes for 100 million people by 2025. Launched in 2014, Virta has already seen jaw-dropping results like:</p><p>94% of insulin users reduced or eliminated usage after 1 year<br/>60% of patients reversed their type 2 diabetes after 1 year*<br/>At Virta, design is central. According to David Hatch, Head of User Experience, it has been that way since the company’s inception, “The goal of design at Virta is to make things that allow all types of people to achieve healthy behavior change.”</p><h2 id="igniting-the-figma-flash-mob"><a href="#igniting-the-figma-flash-mob">Igniting the Figma flash mob</a></h2><p>At Virta, design is a shared investment across all teams — from designers, marketers, and developers to physicians. The 11 person design team operates as a transparent and collaborative internal hub, touching every piece of the company.</p><p>“Other tools we had been using suddenly felt archaic.”<br/>As early adopters of collaborative, web-based design tool Figma — some designers even refer to themselves as “OG Figma users” — Virta Health was designed from the ground up on Figma. Hatch said, “I felt like Figma was the future. The collaborative aspect is where our design culture took off.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef0d835929d56248faa068f641e61fefb695ae0a-1600x1019.jpg?rect=1,0,1599,1019&amp;w=670&amp;h=427&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef0d835929d56248faa068f641e61fefb695ae0a-1600x1019.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef0d835929d56248faa068f641e61fefb695ae0a-1600x1019.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef0d835929d56248faa068f641e61fefb695ae0a-1600x1019.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef0d835929d56248faa068f641e61fefb695ae0a-1600x1019.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ef0d835929d56248faa068f641e61fefb695ae0a-1600x1019.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Virta team meeting<br/>Collaboration and transparency are paramount for this young scaling startup. For Victor Kernes, the newest UX designer to join the team, getting up to speed was no challenge. “I was able to dive right in on day one because everything was current and lived in Figma.” (Fun fact: Victor taught himself to design by using Figma. Listen to his feature on Design Details Podcast).</p><p>As Hatch put it, “The idea that people could be untethered from the desktop environment made the tool easy to adopt.” Anyone can access, comment and participate in design from anywhere, on any machine. But the collaboration feature is what really hooked Hatch:</p><p>“I like to start a project, get something to a certain state and send the link to our UX Slack channel and ask for help. Within seconds I’ll see cursors jump into the canvas, start duplicating and making improvements. It’s impressive to see your team at work together. It’s like a Figma flash mob. Other tools we had been using suddenly felt archaic.”</p><h2 id="consistent-design-is-intuitive-design"><a href="#consistent-design-is-intuitive-design">Consistent design is intuitive design</a></h2><p>The Virta design team subscribes to the principle that consistency is king. For example, if a patient is having a health issue, a physician will need to be able to communicate with their patient as quickly as possible through the Virta app. That path has to be predictable and well-known. There cannot be any unexpected left turns in the design and usability. You have to create consistency across everything. If someone is used to one flow, it can’t be different in another part of the app.</p><p>“I felt like Figma was the future. The collaborative aspect is where our design culture took off.”<br/>For Virta, components in Figma are the key to unlocking consistent design. Once an element becomes repeatable, a component is created and UI can easily be duplicated which saves time. Victor explains, “Figma makes the process of replicating design much easier.”</p><p>Over time, the Virta team has made their component library more sophisticated. Based on the idea that if you build a component well, it allows for the desktop and mobile version to to exist in that single component and be responsive.</p><p>“As a designer who is responsible for creating UI patterns, the one thing I worry about the most is breaking consistent design patterns,” Joey said. “With components in Figma, consistency is created by default.”</p><p>In Virta’s visual component library today, everything is based off a structural component and then the team uses nested components to create new components from that base.</p><p>The team is also taking that principle of basing everything off a structural component and applying that to code to bake in even more consistency.</p><h2 id="empowering-non-designers"><a href="#empowering-non-designers">Empowering non-designers</a></h2><p>With design as the heartbeat of the company, Figma is like the blood supply. Figma files are passing through Slack channels all the time. Marketers are adding copy changes, physicians are providing feedback on prototypes and designers are collaborating.</p><p>In the recent relaunch of VirtaHealth.com, the design team was tasked with reimagining the site in an effort to bring in patients in a more efficient way. Stakeholders included marketing, product, leadership and developers and the entire project took place in Figma — from ideation to developer handoff. “It offered us peace of mind,” recalls Joey.</p><p>With Figma, anyone could see how the project was tracking at any given time. The product team sat with designers during ideation, marketing was able to adjust their own copy and developers were able to move quickly with Figma. That transparency allowed a seemingly big project to get underway fast with their first page going live in just one month.</p><p>“Figma results in us doing more showing rather than telling,” said Dian Xiao, a UX engineer at Virta. “We get better feedback and we can iterate with more up to date information.”</p><p>Victor and Alex Tran, UX designers who partner with the marketing team, came up with a self serve-model which helps marketing move faster. Marketing has access to templatized Figma files for social images, landing pages and collateral. They can go directly into a file, spin up their asset, tag a designer using comments for illustrations or tweaks and voilà, their asset is complete.</p><div><blockquote><p>“Figma results in us showing rather than telling.”</p></blockquote></div><p>According to Victor, it has reduced at least two, if not more, cycles with design and shaved weeks off the process. Joey states, “The most magical part about working in Figma is that it gives non-designers the power to participate in their own content.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0b4570f159ef94874ef6266d8e9d2661858a53c9-2000x1500.png?rect=1,0,1998,1500&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0b4570f159ef94874ef6266d8e9d2661858a53c9-2000x1500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0b4570f159ef94874ef6266d8e9d2661858a53c9-2000x1500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0b4570f159ef94874ef6266d8e9d2661858a53c9-2000x1500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0b4570f159ef94874ef6266d8e9d2661858a53c9-2000x1500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0b4570f159ef94874ef6266d8e9d2661858a53c9-2000x1500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Dian agreed, “It’s great to have someone visually respond back to what you shared instead of using words or Photoshop. People can build on top of your design while you watch.”</p><p>On the app side, collaborating with physicians is woven into the workflow. “What’s important is making sure everything is as functional, succinct, compact and dense as possible while still being very usable,” says Joey. He’ll often send Figma links over to a physician for fast feedback or invite them in during ideation to test a flow. The intuitive nature of Figma allows non-designers to easily jump in. Hatch states, “It’s beautiful to see two sides of house come together with one tool.”</p><h2 id="transforming-the-future-of-healthcare"><a href="#transforming-the-future-of-healthcare">Transforming the future of healthcare</a></h2><p>At Virta, the company has come together around this shared commitment to design and has seen real impact this company in it’s patients:</p><p>“I’ve learned a new way of thinking and a new way of living. I love the way my life is now.” — Wilma, Virta Patient<br/>“The most important part of being in the Virta treatment is the app and scale that sends in my weight everyday gives me accountability.” Shirley, Virta Patient<br/>By delivering a consistent user experience, they are positioned to make a real impression on the healthcare industry. As Hatch said, “We want to be proud of our designs but the most important thing is to serve and heal our patients.”</p><p>*Note that % reversal is defined as the % of patients with HbA1c less than 6.5% who are taking no glycemic control medications or only metformin.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How you can design end to end on a Chromebook</title>

      <description>When Chromebooks first came out, it would’ve been a pipe dream to believe they could replace Macs for designers.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When Chromebooks first came out, it would’ve been a pipe dream to believe they could replace Macs for designers. They were limited by power, software, and screen quality. Even today, few would think to trade out their Apple computer for a Chrome device.</p><p>I’m here to tell you it’s possible, and I’ll even share the tips that made it so. For the past year I’ve been working as a professional, paid (yes, paid!) designer using a Chromebook as my primary computer.</p><h2 id="why-you-ask"><a href="#why-you-ask">Why, you ask?</a></h2><p>Well, Square, my previous company, persuaded me to make the move. They decided to transition some people over for a range of reasons — from the security of Chromebooks (they’re way safe) to their affordability to the fact that files are always backed up and synced.</p><p>As a designer, I could’ve chosen to stick with Macs, but because I worked with people inside the company on internal presentations, I decided I needed the true Chromebook experience to empathize with my “customers.”</p><p>I was wary at first…of course. Would this Chrome computer sit on my desk, collecting dust after a day of usage due to my preference for macOS? I’ve been designing with Figma for the previous three years (I was lucky enough to get an alpha invite), so my primary design software was already in the cloud. But I had no idea how Chromebooks would handle performance, or how I’d go about meeting my other design needs.</p><p>It’s been an adjustment, but overall, I’ve gone Chromebook and I’ll never go back. Below is what you need to know if you’re thinking of making the switch as a designer.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ec830ac16426eb143a3c0e097134b47ec9ad9bd0-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ec830ac16426eb143a3c0e097134b47ec9ad9bd0-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ec830ac16426eb143a3c0e097134b47ec9ad9bd0-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ec830ac16426eb143a3c0e097134b47ec9ad9bd0-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ec830ac16426eb143a3c0e097134b47ec9ad9bd0-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Image courtesy of Google</figcaption></figure><h2 id="six-things-to-know-about-designing-on-chrome-os"><a href="#six-things-to-know-about-designing-on-chrome-os">Six things to know about designing on Chrome OS</a></h2><ol><li>The design tool Figma is the only one I know of that runs in the cloud, so it’s necessary for designing on Chromebooks. I had been using it for the previous 3 years before I switched to Chromebook, so I was in good shape when I made the jump. (Disclaimer: I work at Figma now.)</li><li>The Control key is the Command key equivalent, and yes your finger will get used to its location. The Search key (in place of the caps lock key) can be used as a modifier, such as Search + drag duplicates an object. In Figma, opening the Shortcuts menu will show you keyboard shortcuts for whichever operating system you are currently using, including Chrome OS. (Ctrl + Shift + /)</li><li>Performance has never been an issue. Figma is super fast everywhere I’ve used it, and works great across the three different Chromebooks I’ve tried.</li><li>There are always other tools you need for design: Slack, Grammarly, accessibility testing tool Funkify, and G Suite are all web-based, so I didn’t have issues there either.</li><li>Some things to watch out for: Currently, there is no ability to install custom typefaces, but Google Fonts offers a ton of great options and you have access to all of them.</li><li>Additionally, sometimes you are limited by your access to the internet, however the Chromebook still has some functionality when you are offline. The touchscreen computer has been surprisingly nice to have for scrolling through long documents and Slack conversations or even navigating around a canvas.</li></ol><h2 id="there-are-a-bunch-of-chrome-os-devices-what"><a href="#there-are-a-bunch-of-chrome-os-devices-what">There are a bunch of Chrome OS devices, what should I use to design?</a></h2><p>There’s a ton of options for Chrome hardware, and I’ve looked at all of them. I first tried an HP Chromebook, then I experimented with the stylus and touchscreen of the Samsung Pro. Now, I have the Google Pixelbook, which is my favorite so far. </p><p>The Pixelbook starts at $999, a premium price-point for Chrome devices, but it’s still less than a third of the cost of my previous MacBook Pro. I’m even eager to try some of the lower cost Chrome devices — even a Chromebit, the $85 computer in an HDMI stick. For now, I’m sticking with the Pixelbook because of the quality of the keyboard and trackpad.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f33e6ae7ce38152bb37fbf61d4bde3032136711e-1600x1210.jpg?rect=0,0,1599,1210&amp;w=670&amp;h=507&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f33e6ae7ce38152bb37fbf61d4bde3032136711e-1600x1210.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f33e6ae7ce38152bb37fbf61d4bde3032136711e-1600x1210.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f33e6ae7ce38152bb37fbf61d4bde3032136711e-1600x1210.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f33e6ae7ce38152bb37fbf61d4bde3032136711e-1600x1210.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f33e6ae7ce38152bb37fbf61d4bde3032136711e-1600x1210.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>As a designer, I’m always trying out new tools and workflows to get work done. Here are some of the tools that I’ve found for getting almost all my work done in the cloud:</p><h3 id="creating"><a href="#creating">Creating:</a></h3><ul><li>Figma for designing and prototyping</li><li>SuperHi code editor for building my website</li><li>Google Slides, Figma, and Paste by FiftyThree for presentation design</li><li>Grammarly, Google Docs, and Dropbox Paper for writing</li></ul><h3 id="organizing"><a href="#organizing">Organizing:</a></h3><ul><li>Asana and Google Tasks for keeping track of work</li><li>Bonsai for accounting</li><li>Notion for keeping track of my finances</li><li>1password X for sanity and security</li></ul><h3 id="messaging"><a href="#messaging">Messaging:</a></h3><ul><li>Signal, Telegram, and Slack for messaging from my computer</li><li>Slack and Google Meet for my meetings and video calls</li></ul><h3 id="listening"><a href="#listening">Listening:</a></h3><ul><li>Spotify and Pocket Casts for staying productive</li><li>For video and audio editing, I keep a Mac around with Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. I’m confident that I’ll turn to web-based alternatives for video and audio editing in the future, and if it wasn’t part of my design work, then I would rely solely on Chrome.</li></ul><h2 id="software-has-moved-to-the-web"><a href="#software-has-moved-to-the-web">Software has moved to the web</a></h2><p>As a designer, not having to worry about backing up files or even saving is a relief.

You’re able to let go of the idea of files tied to a device.</p><p>As web technologies continue to advance, so much is possible on the web. Figma started after co-founder Evan Wallace used WebGL to make an interactive swimming pool and sphere with real-time rendering and realistic physics.</p><figure><figcaption>Screen recording from madebyevan.com/webgl-water </figcaption></figure><p>This demonstration proved that browsers were ready to support virtually any type of software — especially professional design tools.</p><p>The web as a platform is unrivaled for accessibility. For the most part, the web is open; anyone can build for it, and there isn’t corporate ownership nor app store evaluation processes as a gateway to your customers. More individuals and teams have access to building and publishing to the web than any operating system platform could, further distributing the access to building products.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>5 ways to use Figma that you probably never thought of</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/five-ways-to-use-figma-that-you-probably-never-thought-of/</link>
      <description>Figma’s magic lives in its collaborative capabilities.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Figma’s magic lives in its collaborative capabilities. If you’ve ever watched someone else’s cursor dance across a frame to tweak a problem spot while you’re filling in copy in that same frame, you know exactly what we’re talking about. In today’s team-oriented digital age, designing with others just feels right.</p><p>Multiplayer, the nickname for our real-time collaboration, was actually inspired by cooperative multiplayer video games. In other words, from the get-go we strove to instill fun into the design process. This is why two of the use cases we’ve highlighted in this post, games and comics, are mentioned purely for recreational purposes: no KPIs here, not unless you want to measure the decibel of a laugh. The other three methods will help you streamline your workflow and organize convoluted information.</p><p>Read on to learn some of the ways we at Figma use our own tool for, well, everything.</p><h2 id="_1-organize-scattered-ideas-with-affinity-diagrams"><a href="#_1-organize-scattered-ideas-with-affinity-diagrams">1. Organize scattered ideas with affinity diagrams</a></h2><figure></figure><p>Organize research findings remotely with your team<br/>In Figma your team is capable of organizing a massive amount of information quickly. One method of doing this is by creating an affinity diagram, which is when you group similar concepts together into themes. Similar to how a team brainstorms with sticky notes slapped onto a whiteboard, you can organize a team’s ideas digitally with Figma. Multiplayer lets them throw ideas into a file in tandem, and afterwards, allows them to collaboratively group those concepts however makes the most sense. This two-step process helps clarify, prioritize and provide initial structure for larger projects. And it’ll be a godsend for anyone with a Type A personality.</p><h2 id="_2-vote-on-different-concepts-in-real-time"><a href="#_2-vote-on-different-concepts-in-real-time">2. Vote on different concepts in real time</a></h2><figure></figure><p>Voting clarifies individual preferences and helps decision making<br/>This solution is best for those wrought with indecision. Similar to the design sprint process, teams will vote on examples of a design feature by printing them out and placing stickers on the ones they prefer or find intriguing. The same can be done in Figma, and without having to walk over to your printer.</p><p>At Figma, we do our own version of this. Everyone opens a file of designs at the same time and places circles next to the ones that catch our attention as being especially on brand for the company. Our designers even make sure the colors of the circles are the same as Figma’s logo. It’s because of Multiplayer that the whole team can be in the file at the same time, perusing possible designs, watching cursors dart about and dragging dots to mark favorites.</p><h2 id="_3-divide-and-conquer-with-a-design-assembly-line"><a href="#_3-divide-and-conquer-with-a-design-assembly-line">3. Divide and conquer with a design assembly line</a></h2><figure></figure><p>ClassPass needed 30+ custom maps. The team designed it together<br/>Faced with a menial, repetitive task in your project and want it done yesterday? Try assembly line production. Instead of building Ford automobiles with a crew, your team will design a digital product. You can do this by splitting up a large simple task amongst several people</p><p>Above is a quick gif showing the design team at ClassPass using Figma to place pins signifying where gyms and studios are located in different cities. Look at them go!</p><h2 id="_4-scrounge-up-some-friends-and-make-a-comic"><a href="#_4-scrounge-up-some-friends-and-make-a-comic">4. Scrounge up some friends and make a comic</a></h2><figure></figure><p>The source file behind a comic about AI and healthcare<br/>Looking for creative ways to hang with friends? Try designing a comic together in Figma. You can watch each other illustrate in real time, then riff off of each other’s ideas. Our vector networks make drawing easy because they offer much more flexibility and control.</p><p>Louis Harboe and Parker Malachowsky did exactly this during their senior year at USC. They turned one of their class presentations (on AI and healthcare) into a comic to make it easy to understand for a wide range of audiences. They landed on using Figma to work in for its collaborative capabilities. Since the comic will be on the longer side, they created components of speech balloons, caption boxes and image panels.</p><h2 id="_5-play-games-to-lighten-the-mood"><a href="#_5-play-games-to-lighten-the-mood">5. Play games to lighten the mood</a></h2><p>Workplace collaboration can take many forms. When you want to unwind and bond with your teammates, what’s better than playing a few collaborative games together? In Figma you could play anything from Pictionary, to Bingo, to Tic Tac Toe. Show off your whimsical and creative side to build up a well of good vibes.</p><p>Case in point: over lunch a few months ago the entire Figma team — at this time there were about 40 of us — designed a sort of “Sim City” together in Figma. Everyone, even the writers with zilch design expertise, was in charge of a square. We dragged components created by Figma designer Rasmus Andersson and plotted out our own little corners of the city.</p><p>Last week a few of us played the game again during a Figma workshop with Airbnb’s design team, this time pitting two teams against each other and using observation mode to have the “mayors” present their city:</p><figure></figure><p>Team 1 had to drop a few 🚒to put out those pesky 🔥from Team 2. 🤣<br/>Has your team come up with unique ways of collaborating in Figma? <br/>Let us know! We’d love to hear about it in the comments.</p><p>Thanks to Noah Levin.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Material Design + Figma Styles = 🔥</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Often when we think of design systems, we think of a tightly controlled collection of components, patterns and guidelines in order to ensure consistency across a product. In the context of a single product or brand, this makes a lot of sense, but what about a design system for a platform that will be adopted by many different brands/products?</p><p>Google’s Material system has been faced with this challenge since its inception. Its adoption has ensured far more consistent experiences across both Google and non-Google native Android applications. That said, although those experiences excel in usability, they’re less successful at becoming memorable extensions of the brand. There’s drawbacks when everyone leverages the same set of components.</p><figure><figcaption>Theming possibilities in Material Design. Source: Material.io</figcaption></figure><p>Enter the next evolution of Material—a system that builds on everything that was great about its first iteration, but adds the ability for brands to theme their system in ways that will allow Material apps to feel less like stock native UI experiences, and more like impactful on-brand experiences.</p><p>With an infinite number of possibilities and such a large library of components, it poses an interesting challenge for designers to easily theme and customize an entire UI kit. I decided to take on the challenge as a side project for collaborative design tool Figma, to see how we could work together to make a Material kit that could leverage Figma features…</p><h2 id="enter-figma-styles"><a href="#enter-figma-styles">Enter Figma Styles</a></h2><p>Figma recently announced a modular take on Styles, allowing you to quickly define global text, fill, stroke, effect and grid styles. Making a change to a style instantly makes a globalized change across your entire document. Additionally, styles can also be pushed to your shared team library, to be used across all of your team’s projects in the same way you would share a component.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3807cc6792ef5891489082a0773f452329d5ce1d-2000x1222.png?rect=0,0,2000,1221&amp;w=670&amp;h=409&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3807cc6792ef5891489082a0773f452329d5ce1d-2000x1222.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3807cc6792ef5891489082a0773f452329d5ce1d-2000x1222.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3807cc6792ef5891489082a0773f452329d5ce1d-2000x1222.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3807cc6792ef5891489082a0773f452329d5ce1d-2000x1222.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3807cc6792ef5891489082a0773f452329d5ce1d-2000x1222.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Configuration page for customizing the Material Theme.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="see-what-s-possible"><a href="#see-what-s-possible">See what’s possible</a></h2><p>I was fortunate enough to get early access to Figma Styles, and got excited about the possibilities of using them for Material Design. So I created a Material UI kit using Styles to make building Material apps much easier. While this isn’t an official kit or partnership, I think it showcases how well these things work together.</p><p><strong>Material Colors</strong> — I used a fill style for all of the primary and secondary app colors, all levels of emphasis for typography, and a number of swatches for surface colors. Modifying the theme to match your brand’s colors is as easy as picking new colors. I also included a page in the document to access the stock Material palette. Alternatively you can also use Google’s new color tool as a starting point.</p><figure><figcaption>Making global color changes to affect multiple components at once.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Material Type</strong>—I created text styles for the all of the styles specified in the Material Design spec. By default these are set to <a href="https://www.figma.com/google-fonts/roboto-font-pairings/">Roboto</a>, but can be easily redefined to use your brand’s typeface. Changing a style to a different font will instantly propagate the changes across the whole system. Bear in mind, you may need to make some adjustments to type size and spacing in order to fine tune the sizing across the system. As the kit evolves, I plan to include some predefined size recommendations that work for some of the most popular Google fonts.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cacc1951d1cf6e837331d7098ee04b5f290956ec-885x663.jpg?w=670&amp;h=502&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cacc1951d1cf6e837331d7098ee04b5f290956ec-885x663.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cacc1951d1cf6e837331d7098ee04b5f290956ec-885x663.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cacc1951d1cf6e837331d7098ee04b5f290956ec-885x663.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cacc1951d1cf6e837331d7098ee04b5f290956ec-885x663.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 885w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Some of the styles defined in the kit.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Material Elevation</strong>—I created a library of preset drop shadow styles for all elevations. Changing the elevation of an element is as easy as choosing the appropriate elevation—this greatly simplifies the process of applying Material shadows which are sometimes complex combinations of up to three different drop shadows.</p><p><strong>Material Grid</strong>—Material is based on a 4dp baseline grid so I created a style for that too. You can apply this to any frame or component, and of course, you can add your own grids for desktop, mobile and tablet and apply them as needed.</p><h2 id="combining-styles-with-components"><a href="#combining-styles-with-components">Combining Styles with Components</a></h2><p>Material Design encourages designers to control the shapes of UI components to better reflect the personality of the brand. They give users the option to customize surface corners, ranging from sharp rectangular corners, to 45 degree cuts, to varying levels of roundedness.</p><figure><figcaption>Using nested components to make globalized changes to card and button shapes.</figcaption></figure><p>To achieve this, I created some basic shape components for buttons, floating action buttons, and cards. This gives users the ability to adjust the size of the cuts or the degree of corner radius for any chosen shape. Then I nested those components within another master component which would become the base for corresponding components in the system. If you decided you wanted to have cut-off corners, it is as simple as toggling the visibility of the correct nested component.</p><p>That change is then reflected across the entire system (note: in some cases this will take a few seconds for the change to propagate through hundreds of components). Because you can access the nested layers within every component instance, if there are specific places where you want change the style, you can make that change as an override in any instance.</p><p>Material Design also give you the option to change between 5 different icon styles. To keep the weight of the kit down, we created 5 separate sticker sheet documents for each icon style, complete with components for each icon. You can copy the desired icons from those files, or better yet, publish them as a shared library to your team and pull them into your projects.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma Styles beta: A new way to apply text and layer attributes</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-styles-beta-a-new-way-to-apply-text-and-layer-attributes/</link>
      <description>Today, we’re excited to announce a private beta for Figma Styles.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Edit: The Styles beta group is now closed. Thanks to everyone who indicated interest! We’ll be following up soon.</em></p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="ClZ0RXbuHDH-" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>Today, we’re excited to announce a private beta for Figma Styles. Styles will simplify your workflow and keep text and layer attributes consistent across all your documents. We took a modular approach, allowing you to apply text, fill, layout grid, effect and stroke styles separately.</p><p>These styles will be accessible in your team library, to allow everyone to stay in sync with the most up-to-date versions. You can enable your team’s Styles, and you’ll receive notifications when there are changes.</p><p>After joining Figma, I worked together with Rasmus, one of our designers, to finalize the interaction model for Styles. Through previous user studies, he and the team surfaced key pain points with using styles in other tools. They honed in on the exact issues I struggled with, and I was excited by their solutions.</p><p>When we release Figma Styles publicly, we’ll do a deep dive into our approach’s benefits. In the meantime, here’s a glimpse at two of the major pain points it solves:</p><h2 id="pain-point-1-setting-up-text-styles"><a href="#pain-point-1-setting-up-text-styles">Pain Point 1: Setting up text Styles</a></h2><p>Traditionally, text styles tie form, color and alignment together. If your brand uses a font like Helvetica, you’d need to create Helvetica styles for headers (h1), subheads (h2) and paragraph text (p). If you add a few colors to the mix — for example, to highlight link text — things become exponentially complicated. In most design tools, you can’t separate text and color style, so you must create 9 styles — 3 colors for each of the 3 text formats (and that doesn’t even include text alignment).</p><p>If your brand changes — let’s say you realized your ‘light grey’ link color doesn’t pass accessibility tests — you have to manually update all of the styles impacted by that change.</p><p>We fixed this problem by breaking apart form, color and alignment. All three attributes can be set up (and then used) individually. If your link color changes, simply update the original fill style and it will propagate through your design in all the places where it was used.</p><h2 id="pain-point-2-using-styles-in-text-fields"><a href="#pain-point-2-using-styles-in-text-fields">Pain point 2: Using Styles in text fields</a></h2><figure></figure><p>Override any part of your text field with a specific style<br/>In most design tools, text fields can only hold one style. That means if you want to format part of a sentence as a link, include a section header, or make any other adjustments, you’ll distort the connection between the text field and the originally applied style.</p><p>In Figma, text fields work a little differently. Users can select and apply various text and fill styles inside one text field by highlighting a portion of the text. This will make it easier to add subheads or define sections of the text as links (among other things). They will keep their connection and update when you change the related style.</p><h2 id="sign-up-now"><a href="#sign-up-now">Sign up now</a></h2><p>This is a new way of working with styles, and while it might be an adjustment, we believe the rewards will be worth it. It will ease daily pain points for individual designers, and give teams flexibility to customize their design systems at scale.</p><p>If you’re interested in checking it out, drop us a line here.</p><p>Note: With the beta, we will be migrating smaller teams before larger teams, and it’s a one way migration.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Rust in Production at Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/</link>
      <description>How Mozilla’s new language dramatically improved our server-side performance</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Like building state-of-the-art web apps? <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">Come work at Figma!</a></em></p><p>At <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>, performance is one of our most important features. We strive to enable teams to work at the speed of thought, and our multiplayer syncing engine is a critical part of this vision. Everyone should see each change made to a Figma document in real time.</p><p>The multiplayer server we <a href="https://blog.figma.com/multiplayer-editing-in-figma-8f8076c6c3a6">launched with two years ago</a> is written in TypeScript and has served us surprisingly well, but Figma is rapidly growing more popular and that server isn’t going to be able to keep up. We decided to fix this by rewriting it in Rust.</p><p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/">Rust</a> is a new programming language from Mozilla, the company that makes Firefox. They’re using it to build a next-generation browser prototype called <a href="https://research.mozilla.org/servo-engines/">Servo</a> which demonstrates that browsers can be way faster than they are today. Rust is similar to C++ in performance and low-level ability but has a type system which <a href="https://polyfloyd.net/post/how-rust-helps-you-prevent-bugs/">automatically prevents whole classes of nasty bugs</a> that are common in C++ programs.</p><p>We chose Rust for this rewrite because it combines best-in-class speed with low resource usage while still offering the safety of standard server languages. Low resource usage was particularly important to us because some of the performance issues with the old server were caused by the garbage collector.</p><p>We think this is an interesting case study of using Rust in production and want to share the issues we encountered and the benefits we achieved in the hope that it will be useful to others considering a similar rewrite.</p><h2 id="scaling-our-service-with-rust"><a href="#scaling-our-service-with-rust">Scaling our service with Rust</a></h2><p>Our multiplayer service is run on a fixed number of machines, each with a fixed number of workers, and each document lives exclusively on one specific worker. That means each worker is responsible for some fraction of currently open Figma documents. It looks something like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f1548aa28e236a50ba53859b13c5fdf70908bb6-800x531.png?rect=0,0,799,531&amp;w=670&amp;h=445&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f1548aa28e236a50ba53859b13c5fdf70908bb6-800x531.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f1548aa28e236a50ba53859b13c5fdf70908bb6-800x531.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f1548aa28e236a50ba53859b13c5fdf70908bb6-800x531.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f1548aa28e236a50ba53859b13c5fdf70908bb6-800x531.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The main problem with the old server was the unpredictable latency spikes during syncing. The server was written in TypeScript and, being single-threaded, couldn’t process operations in parallel. That meant a single slow operation would lock up the entire worker until it was complete. A common operation is to encode the document and Figma documents can get very large, so operations would take an arbitrarily-long amount of time. Users connected to that worker would be unable to sync their changes in the meantime.</p><p>Throwing more hardware at the problem wouldn’t have solved this issue because a single slow operation would still lock up the worker for all files associated with that worker. And we couldn’t just create a separate node.js process for every document because the memory overhead of the JavaScript VM would have been too high. Really only a handful of documents were ever big enough to cause problems, but they were affecting the quality of service for everyone. Our temporary solution was to isolate the crazy documents to a completely separate pool of “heavy” workers:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7cb4c2114a729a419638d4235f01fc1b260a3cf0-800x531.png?rect=0,0,799,531&amp;w=670&amp;h=445&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7cb4c2114a729a419638d4235f01fc1b260a3cf0-800x531.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7cb4c2114a729a419638d4235f01fc1b260a3cf0-800x531.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7cb4c2114a729a419638d4235f01fc1b260a3cf0-800x531.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7cb4c2114a729a419638d4235f01fc1b260a3cf0-800x531.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>This kept the service up but meant we had to continually look out for crazy documents and move them over to the heavy worker pool by hand. It bought us enough time to solve these problems for real, which we did by moving the performance-sensitive parts of the multiplayer server into a separate child process. That child process is written in Rust and communicates with its host process using stdin and stdout. It uses so little memory compared to the old system that we can afford to fully parallelize all documents by just using a separate child process per document. And serialization time is now over 10x faster so the service is now acceptably fast even in the worst case. The new architecture looks like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87448ddbbe8f49d41fd89618c644b2738bc8249c-800x504.png?w=670&amp;h=422&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87448ddbbe8f49d41fd89618c644b2738bc8249c-800x504.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87448ddbbe8f49d41fd89618c644b2738bc8249c-800x504.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87448ddbbe8f49d41fd89618c644b2738bc8249c-800x504.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87448ddbbe8f49d41fd89618c644b2738bc8249c-800x504.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="server-side-performance-improvements"><a href="#server-side-performance-improvements">Server-side performance improvements</a></h2><p>The performance improvements are incredible.

performance server, it turns out the language wasn’t as ready as we thought. It’s much newer than standard server-side languages and still has a lot of rough edges (described below).</p><p>As a result, we dropped our initial plan to rewrite our whole server in Rust and chose to focus solely on the performance-sensitive part instead. Here are the pros and cons we encountered in that rewrite:</p><h3 id="pros"><a href="#pros">Pros</a></h3><ul><li>Low memory usage</li></ul><p>Rust combines fine-grained control over memory layout with the lack of a GC and has a very minimal standard library. It used so little memory that it was actually practical to just start a separate Rust process for every document.</p><ul><li>Awesome performance</li></ul><p>Rust definitely delivered on its promise of optimal performance, both because it can take advantage of all of LLVM’s optimizations and because the language itself is designed with performance in mind. Rust’s <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.22.0/std/slice/">slices</a> make passing raw pointers around easy, ergonomic, and safe, and we used that a lot to avoid copying data during parsing. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html">HashMap API</a> is implemented with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_probing">linear probing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Robin_Hood_hashing">Robin Hood hashing</a>, so unlike C++’s <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map">unordered_map API</a> the contents can be stored inline in a single allocation and are much more cache-efficient.</p><ul><li>Solid toolchain</li></ul><p>Rust comes with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html">cargo</a> built-in, which is a build tool, package manager, test runner, and documentation generator. This is a standard addition for most modern languages but is a very welcome improvement coming from the outdated world of C++, the other language we had considered using for the rewrite. Cargo was well-documented and easy to use, and it had helpful defaults.</p><ul><li>Friendly error messages</li></ul><p>Rust is more complex than other languages because it has an additional piece, the borrow checker, with its own unique rules that need to be learned. People have put a lot of effort into making the error messages readable and it really shows. They make learning Rust much nicer.</p><h3 id="cons"><a href="#cons">Cons</a></h3><ul><li>Lifetimes are confusing</li></ul><p>In Rust, storing a pointer in a variable can prevent you from mutating the thing it points to as long as that variable is in scope. This guarantees safety but is overly restrictive since the variable may not be needed anymore by the time the mutation happens. Even as someone who has been following Rust from the start, who writes compilers for fun, and who knows how to think like the borrow checker, it’s still frustrating to have to pause your work to solve the little unnecessary borrow checker puzzles that can come up regularly as you work. There are good examples of the problems this creates in <a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2016/04/27/non-lexical-lifetimes-introduction/">this blog post</a>.</p><p><em>What we did about it:</em> We simplified our program to a single event loop that reads data from stdin and writes data to stdout (stderr is used for logging). Data either lives forever or only lives for the duration of the event loop. This eliminated pretty much all borrow checker complexities.</p><p><em>How this is being fixed:</em> The Rust community is planning to address this with <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2094-nll.md">non-lexical lifetimes</a>. This feature shrinks the lifetime of a variable such that it stops after the last time it’s used. Then a pointer will no longer prevent the mutation of the thing it points to for the rest of the scope, which will eliminate many borrow checker false-positives.</p><ul><li>Errors are hard to debug</li></ul><p>Error-handling in Rust is intended to be done by returning a value called “Result” that can represent either success or failure. Unlike with exceptions, creating an error value in Rust does not capture a stack trace so any stack traces you get are for the code that reported the error instead of the code that caused the error.</p><p><em>What we did about it:</em> We ended up converting all errors to strings immediately and then using a macro that includes the line and column of the failure in the string. This was verbose but got the job done.</p><p><em>How this is being fixed:</em> The Rust community has apparently come up with several workarounds for this issue. One of them is called <a href="https://docs.rs/error-chain/*/error_chain/">error-chain</a> and another one is called <a href="https://boats.gitlab.io/failure/">failure</a>. We didn’t realize these existed and we aren’t sure if there’s a standard approach.</p><ul><li>Many libraries are still early</li></ul><p>Figma’s document format is compressed so our server needed to be able to handle compressed data. We tried using two separate Rust compression libraries that were both used by Servo, Mozilla’s next-generation browser prototype, but both had subtle correctness issues that would have resulted in data loss.</p><p><em>What we did about it:</em> We ended up just using a tried-and-true C library instead. Rust is built on LLVM so it’s pretty trivial to call C code from Rust. Everything is just LLVM bitcode in the end!</p><p><em>How this is being fixed:</em> The bugs in the affected libraries were reported and have since been fixed.</p><ul><li>Asynchronous Rust is difficult</li></ul><p>Our multiplayer server talks over WebSockets and makes HTTP requests every so often. We tried writing these request handlers in Rust but hit some concerning ergonomic issues around the futures API (Rust’s answer for asynchronous programming). The <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.1.25/futures/">futures API</a> is very efficient but somewhat complex as a result.</p><p>For example, chaining operations together is done by constructing a giant nested type that represents the whole operation chain. This means everything for that chain can be allocated in a single allocation, but it means that error messages generate long unreadable errors reminiscent of template errors in C++ (an example is <a href="https://gist.github.com/evanw/06a672db1897482eadfbbf37ebf9b9ec">here</a>). That combined with other issues such as needing to adapt between different error types and having to solve complex lifetime issues made us decide to abandon this approach.</p><p><em>What we did about it:</em> Instead of going all-in on Rust, we decided to keep the network handling in node.js for now. The node.js process creates a separate Rust child process per document and communicates with it using a message-based protocol over stdin and stdout. All network traffic is passed between processes using these messages.</p><p><em>How this is being fixed:</em> The Rust team is hard at work on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2033-experimental-coroutines.md">adding async/await to Rust</a>, which should solve many of these issues by hiding the complexity of futures underneath the language itself. This will allow the “?” error-handling operator that currently only works with synchronous code to also work with asynchronous code, which will cut down on boilerplate.</p><h2 id="rust-and-the-future"><a href="#rust-and-the-future">Rust and the future</a></h2><p>While we hit some speed bumps, I want to emphasize that our experience with Rust was very positive overall. It’s an incredibly promising project with a solid core and a healthy community. I’m confident these issues will end up being solved over time.</p><p>Our multiplayer server is a small amount of performance-critical code with minimal dependencies, so rewriting it in Rust even with the issues that came up was a good tradeoff for us. It enabled us to improve server-side multiplayer editing performance by an order of magnitude and set Figma’s multiplayer server up to scale long into the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of you have actually <a href="https://blog.figma.com/want-figma-api-inspiration-heres-8-community-powered-projects-ddaef8a6f288">made working prototypes</a>, and <a href="https://medium.com/pagedraw/pagedraw-figma-integration-5f99090ec1d4">Pagedraw</a> even built a whole product around it!</p><p>We’re loving the enthusiasm and thought we’d share our own attempt at a React converter, discuss some of the subtle design choices and technical solutions that went into its development, and expound on the vision that motivated its creation. If you want to follow along, we’ve open sourced the code at <a href="https://github.com/figma/figma-api-demo/tree/master/figma-to-react">GitHub</a>. (Too excited to read this blog post and want to play around with our read API right now? Check out our <a href="https://www.figma.com/developers">Developers</a> page!)</p><p>We wanted to solve two main problems when building Figma to React. One was to have the design for components we generate to live as much in Figma as possible. How amazing would it be to update a design in Figma, and then click a button to sync those design changes to your website? This also means that we need to ensure updating your design doesn’t overwrite any custom code that we have written to make the website or app functional, and that it naturally lends itself to having Figma-generated design code and functional code live separately in neat compartments.</p><p>The second but related goal was to make it easy to attach existing functional code to new designs. For example, in the sorted list example above, it would be nice if we could design a new sorted list and easily attach the code we’d already written to it. In other words, it would be great to have our functional code be <em>reusable</em> across designs, just like how you might reuse React components.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="from-figma-to-css"><a href="#from-figma-to-css">From Figma to CSS</a></h2><p>The first hurdle to Figma to React was creating React components that look like the designs they represent — otherwise, there’s not much point to any of this.

For example, we could render an image of the entire frame and create a component that just draws that image. This approach is simple but very limited; for example, it’s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area">almost</a> impossible to do something interactive here like clicking a button to sort.</p><div><blockquote><p>The first hurdle to Figma to React was creating React components that look like the designs they represent — otherwise, there’s not much point to any of this.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="use-absolute-layout-to-position-nodes"><a href="#use-absolute-layout-to-position-nodes">Use absolute layout to position nodes</a></h2><p>A better approach would be to break the frame down into its constituent pieces, convert each piece into a DOM element like a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>, and then compose those DOM elements together. Composing these elements is a process called layout in which we specify where each element should be placed and how it should be sized relative to every other element.</p><p>The Figma API provides a solid foundation for determining layout. Each node in a document has a property called <code>absoluteBoundingBox</code>. Using <code>absoluteBoundingBox</code>, we can figure out exactly where each node currently lives on the canvas, and how much space it occupies. From this, one idea would be to take each node, render it as an element, and then use CSS absolute positioning to place it on the page. Doing so, we might get something like this (notice that the frame is still stuck to the top left corner):</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?rect=1,0,1199,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fa57b23d06741d6cffc2e5731aa28083899740d6-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1199w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>This looks pretty much the same as if we had rendered the entire frame as an image, however we’ve already made a lot of progress. We can now select the text in the list, we can potentially replace the text with something dynamic, and we can attach events to clicking on different things in the scene (like the sorting arrows). Despite that, many shortcomings remain. If we add a lot of text to this list item box, the text will spill over outside the rectangle. Looking at these absolute bounds turns out to be too constraining. We need to loosen our grip over layout and allow elements to dynamically resize as the design intended.</p><h2 id="use-figma-constraints-to-resize-nodes-dynamically"><a href="#use-figma-constraints-to-resize-nodes-dynamically">Use Figma constraints to resize nodes dynamically</a></h2><figure></figure><p>Figma and other design tools have a concept of <em>constraints</em> that can be applied to a layer that make them resize according to their parent frame. These constraints are reflected in the API as the constraints property, shown here for the previous text node:</p><div><pre><code><span>&#34;constraints&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>&#34;vertical&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;TOP&#34;</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>  </span><span>&#34;horizontal&#34;</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>&#34;LEFT_RIGHT&#34;</span><span> 
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>This says that this particular text element should be positioned relative to the top of the parent, and should stretch with the parent horizontally such that the left and right margins are preserved. The parent in this case is the rectangle surrounding “List item 1”. Applying constraints out of the box to absolute positioning is a direct mapping to the left, right, top, and bottom attributes in CSS. This deals with the list container changing size and shape, but not with the list contents themselves changing. For instance, how would we adapt if we wanted to add another list element dynamically, or if the text that goes in that list element exceeds the dimensions of the original box?</p><h2 id="layout-top-down-or-bottom-up"><a href="#layout-top-down-or-bottom-up">Layout: top-down or bottom-up?</a></h2><p>The problems above happen to be what HTML itself is adept at solving. If you stack two div elements one on top of the other, changing the height of the first div will automatically push the second div down. This behavior doesn’t work in our situation because everything is absolutely positioned, and so they’re locked in place!</p><p>Stacking divs one atop the other based on how much content is in each one is an approach that we’ll call <em>bottom-up</em> layout, meaning we start from the lowest building blocks (say, pieces of text) and build up the structure by composing those blocks together to get the shape of the higher level layers. In contrast, what we so far have done is <em>top-down</em> layout, in which we specify how much space the top-most layer should take up, and then place the elements that make up this higher layer within it. What if we take a combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches?</p><p>Let’s decide on how we want to react when content within one of our elements changes. In some cases, the answer is obvious:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0a383dc55c4b3b6f6db48a4c150d97f39c3b71ac-798x486.png?w=670&amp;h=408&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0a383dc55c4b3b6f6db48a4c150d97f39c3b71ac-798x486.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0a383dc55c4b3b6f6db48a4c150d97f39c3b71ac-798x486.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0a383dc55c4b3b6f6db48a4c150d97f39c3b71ac-798x486.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0a383dc55c4b3b6f6db48a4c150d97f39c3b71ac-798x486.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 798w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Imagine that the dashed boxes are the elements that live inside an outer frame.

The solution I ended up going with was pragmatic, but in many cases imperfect. The main insight is that most websites are arranged vertically, as website convention is that you scroll from top to bottom to view all available content. Given that, I decided to treat child elements of a node as if they had a linear ordering from top to bottom.</p><p>If we apply that to the first example above, the ordering might look something like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f8535869a7f31ce527e4550644c22e765ab655d-1200x900.png?rect=1,0,1199,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f8535869a7f31ce527e4550644c22e765ab655d-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f8535869a7f31ce527e4550644c22e765ab655d-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f8535869a7f31ce527e4550644c22e765ab655d-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f8535869a7f31ce527e4550644c22e765ab655d-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6f8535869a7f31ce527e4550644c22e765ab655d-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1199w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Now, if we want to expand the first text box, we push everything that comes after it in the ordering down to match the amount that it expanded by:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd1fb0fe3b9382a875843497e200a459761bbc55-1200x900.png?rect=1,0,1199,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd1fb0fe3b9382a875843497e200a459761bbc55-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd1fb0fe3b9382a875843497e200a459761bbc55-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd1fb0fe3b9382a875843497e200a459761bbc55-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd1fb0fe3b9382a875843497e200a459761bbc55-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/fd1fb0fe3b9382a875843497e200a459761bbc55-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1199w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Notice that in the above example the result is strange, but borderline reasonable.

We then simply set the margin-top CSS property of the current element to this difference. Now, if one element changes, the others will flow up and down the page as one would expect. The same can be done of <code>BOTTOM</code> aligned elements, treating them as a separate group. The result is that for any node, we can separate its children elements into three groups:</p><ul><li>A group of <code>TOP</code> aligned elements, with bottom-up layout</li><li>A group of elements that are <code>CENTER</code>, <code>SCALE</code>, or <code>TOP_BOTTOM</code> aligned, positioned with absolute (or top-down) layout</li><li>A group of <code>BOTTOM</code> aligned elements, again with bottom-up layout</li></ul><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?rect=0,0,1009,806&amp;w=670&amp;h=535&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/214eb936619d73e25ceebb4bb6b4e7d067e69c0b-1010x806.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1009w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>3-stack layout</figcaption></figure><p>If we apply these ideas to the sortable list, we can now output a fully reactive component that both resizes to fit the container and adapts to changing content within itself, as shown below.</p><figure><figcaption>Wrapping and constraints in action</figcaption></figure><p>One thing to point out in this clip is that the footer stops moving at a certain point — in other words, the document stops becoming shorter at a fixed point. This is crucial to ensure that for example the footer doesn’t run into the main content of the component. However, this can’t just be implemented as minimum height on the element: as the text resizes, the minimum height has to grow to accommodate the extra text. The solution here is to add a bottom margin to the top-aligned elements (and a top-margin to the bottom-aligned elements) such that they butt against the opposite end of their parent and “prop” their parent open to a certain size.</p><h2 id="push-out-and-in-at-the-same-time"><a href="#push-out-and-in-at-the-same-time">Push out and in at the same time</a></h2><p>Finally, let’s look back at how the bottom-up and top-down constraints interact with one another in the case of the list above. In this next example we highlight three elements that are instrumental in making the list items resize correctly: the containing frame (outer dashed box), the text field (inner dashed box), and the round rectangular border (outlined in solid blue).</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670&amp;h=418&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb40f9c7a4b8c4afbb58b612170bb302f6c232fe-1414x882.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Constraints visualized</figcaption></figure><p>The relationship between these elements is as follows: the text element and rectangular stage are both children of the frame. The text element has <code>LEFT_RIGHT</code> and <code>TOP</code> constraints on the frame, and the rectangle has <code>LEFT_RIGHT</code> and <code>TOP_BOTTOM</code> constraints. As the frame narrows, the text has to squeeze onto a second line, increasing its height. Because its margins remain constant, this causes the containing frame also to enlarge, which causes the next frame in the list to be pushed down. At the same time, because the rectangle (again, in blue) has a <code>TOP_BOTTOM</code> constraint to that frame, it too has to resize and become bigger to satisfy that constraint. So we have a bottom-up constraint where the inner text makes the outer frame larger, and then a top-down constraint where the outer frame makes the inner rectangle larger. I really feel like this is one of those interactions where the result is entirely unremarkable (this is exactly the behavior you would expect) but the journey to get there is fairly creative.</p><h2 id="make-the-list-act-like-a-list"><a href="#make-the-list-act-like-a-list">Make the list act like a list</a></h2><p>Now that we’ve got ourselves something that looks like a list, how do we make this list do list-y things? How can we make it load arbitrary data, for example? Or sort that data?</p><p>Our React converter will have to spit out some files with React components in them. Every time we change the design, we’ll have to at least change some of the contents of some of these files to represent the changes in the design. In order to make the components <em>do things</em> we probably want to write some code somewhere that can interact with the generated components. Lastly, the code that we write shouldn’t ever be overwritten by the generator and ideally could be portable from one component to another.</p><p>You might’ve noticed by now that the previous section on layout doesn’t depend on React at all. You’re right — we could’ve made our converter generate pure HTML and CSS and it would’ve worked just as well so far. That’s because a pure conversion of a Figma frame results in a static component, and React proffers no significant advantages when it comes to rendering a static site besides composability of code.</p><p>But now we’ll have to lean in on React more heavily. I’ll introduce just two basic concepts that I conceived of to solve the functionality problem. Their advantage is that they are simple yet surprisingly powerful, but in no way do I imply that these concepts are the only ways to do things — maybe you can offer or implement your own solutions to this problem.</p><h2 id="gadgets-reusable-code-blobs-that-stick-to-designs"><a href="#gadgets-reusable-code-blobs-that-stick-to-designs">Gadgets: reusable code blobs that stick to designs</a></h2><p>The first concept I want to introduce is that of a Gadget (called “components” in the code). A Gadget is a wrapper that goes around any node in a Figma design and adds a piece of functionality to it — any functionality at all. You can create or attach a Gadget to a Figma node by putting a hash symbol (‘#’) in front of its name.</p><p>For example, if you want to say that a frame should behave like a clock, you could name it <code>#Clock</code>. This won’t do anything special in the file itself, but will trigger that node to be Gadgetized in the converter — this will create a Gadget file called <code>CClock.js</code> that you can fill in with functionality. Perhaps the easiest way to explain this is to show an example:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/582d3b59316b1b742c0731f9353bc4cfecd977c0-1200x900.png?rect=1,0,1199,900&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/582d3b59316b1b742c0731f9353bc4cfecd977c0-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/582d3b59316b1b742c0731f9353bc4cfecd977c0-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/582d3b59316b1b742c0731f9353bc4cfecd977c0-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/582d3b59316b1b742c0731f9353bc4cfecd977c0-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/582d3b59316b1b742c0731f9353bc4cfecd977c0-1200x900.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1199w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Sample generated code</figcaption></figure><p>In this scene we have a container with two frames inside. One frame contains a picture of a circle and the other a picture of a square. Say we want both frames to exhibit some custom (but same) behavior, like we want to animate both spinning around. We can wrap each frame in the same Gadget (called <code>#Spinner</code>). This will generate a customizable code file <code>CSpinner.js</code>. The generated left hand side will reference this Gadget component every time a node annotated as a <code>#Spinner</code> appears in the node tree. The code will also pass a nodeID to the Gadget that it can use to look up its contents in each case— <em>the power of Gadgets is that they can be applied to any node, so the contents of the node can vary from instance to instance.</em></p><div><blockquote><p>A Gadget is a wrapper that goes around any node in a Figma design and adds a piece of functionality to it — any functionality at all.</p></blockquote></div><p>That means that if we code <code>CSpinner.js</code> to make the contents animate and spin around, we can make <em>any node</em> spin around by naming it <code>#Spinner</code> and thus attaching the Gadget code to it. If we apply the animation code to <code>CSpinner</code>, we get this:</p><figure><figcaption>#Spinner in action</figcaption></figure><p>Notice that in its render function the <code>CSpinner</code> component simply references Component which is obtained from <code>getComponentById</code>. <code>CSpinner</code> is unaware of what it is wrapping — a complete disentanglement of function from design. Note also that once <code>CSpinner.js</code> is generated we will never overwrite it: any changes made to it are persisted no matter how many times you regenerate the designs.</p><h2 id="variables-swap-out-placeholder-text-with-dynamic"><a href="#variables-swap-out-placeholder-text-with-dynamic">Variables: swap out placeholder text with dynamic values</a></h2><p>Variables are the second concept that we introduce. A variable is simply a text node whose name starts with <code>$</code>. Such a node will by default show the text in the design, but can be overridden by React props to show arbitrary text. The property that overrides the text is the same as the name of the node minus the <code>$</code>. So as an example, if I have a node called $chicken and props coming into that element looks like <code>{chicken: &#34;poptarts&#34;}</code>, then the text of that node will be replaced with the string <code>&#34;poptarts&#34;</code>. You can send these properties down by wrapping nodes with variables in a Gadget.</p><p>Let’s put this all together: for our sorted list, we want something that can take a data source and populate a list entry for each item in the data source. Given that we want to take one list item and duplicate it many times, it makes sense to put a Gadget around the node corresponding to the list item. Such a Gadget may look like this:</p><div><pre><code><span>class</span><span> </span><span>CListItems</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>PureComponent</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

This is to ensure that we can always start with a capital letter which is React convention for component names (another way would be to just capitalize the first letter).</li><li><strong>We default to showing what’s in the Figma document if no listItems are provided.</strong> This is recommended so that the page can function without having to provide any data sources.</li><li><strong>We can use Component, which is the node the Gadget is wrapping, multiple times in the render function!</strong> This is how we can duplicate the list item.</li><li><strong>We have to wrap each Component in a div</strong>. This is to apply the <code>position: relative</code> style, which is necessary in the case of our file. The details of why this is aren’t important, but it’s nice that we can do this. Note that you could just as easily attach a class here and style this in CSS. React in fact discourages inline styles in its style guide. You can imagine implementing a converter that outputs a CSS file without too much additional difficulty.</li></ul><p>So why can’t we just load the data source directly in this component? The reason is because we want to create a <em>sortable</em> list, and the controls for sorting are outside of this component. Because the <code>ListItems</code> component and the buttons to sort ascending and descending are on completely different subtrees, they can only communicate between one another through a common parent. They have to talk through this parent, so we might as well have the parent be responsible for being the canonical source of truth for the list elements.</p><p>There are a number of ways around this. You could easily attach Redux to each component and communicate through actions and the global store. This would also have the advantage of being more maintainable. But for the sake of code simplicity, I’ll show how to achieve the same end result with React only.</p><h2 id="load-custom-data-into-the-list"><a href="#load-custom-data-into-the-list">Load custom data into the list</a></h2><p>Next let’s set up the common parent component:</p><div><pre><code><span>export</span><span> </span><span>class</span><span> </span><span>CSortableList</span><span> </span><span>extends</span><span> </span><span>React</span><span>.</span><span>PureComponent</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

</span><span>  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>This Gadget is wrapped around the button that triggers sorting the list in ascending order. Because one of its ancestors is a <code>CSortableList</code>, we’re able to call into the <code>props.sortAscending()</code> function which will cause the state in <code>CSortableList</code> to change, triggering a rerender of the <code>CListItems</code> Gadget and rearranging the list items therein. Let’s attach all these Gadgets to our original design, create a <code>CSortableList</code> component with <code>listSource</code> set to <code>/shapes.json</code>, and see what happens:</p><figure><figcaption>Sorting custom data</figcaption></figure><h2 id="reuse-of-code"><a href="#reuse-of-code">Reuse of code</a></h2><p>This particular example is now functional! Even more exciting though is that now that we have this code, it’s easy to attach it to anything that we want to make into a sortable list by naming the nodes in Figma to what we called our Gadgets. We’ve managed to encapsulate functionality into these Gadget files that can be arbitrarily plunked onto any Figma node. Is this the way that interfaces should be built? Probably not exactly. Are there lessons to be learned here and insights that can be gleaned toward advancing how we think about the interaction of design and code? We hope so.</p><h3 id="future-work-prototyping-css-grid-layout-grids"><a href="#future-work-prototyping-css-grid-layout-grids">Future work: prototyping, CSS Grid, Layout Grids</a></h3><p>A few ideas for extending Figma to React:</p><ul><li>Respect prototyping links so that clicking on an element transitions the app to a different state</li><li>Implement hover states</li><li>Generate a stylesheet that uses CSS grid to layout the elements</li><li>Respect layout columns and rows in Figma</li><li>Implement support for rotated nodes (right now any node with rotation or skew won’t be correctly rendered)</li></ul><h2 id="go-west"><a href="#go-west">Go West</a></h2><p>Here we have presented what we hope to be a diamond in the rough. We laid out our strategy for mapping constraints to HTML and for attaching reusable code to designs. If you missed the link in the intro, we’ve open-sourced the code for Figma To React over at <a href="https://github.com/figma/figma-api-demo/tree/master/figma-to-react">Github</a>.</p><p>Interface design can benefit by embracing code, instead of having design and code live in two separate worlds imitating each other. By fusing them together into a shared library, designers and developers can cut down on menial work and spend time on what matters: solving bigger challenges.</p><p>Excited to build something of your own with our API?

      <title>Want Figma API inspiration? Here&#39;s 8 community powered projects</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/want-figma-api-inspiration-heres-8-community-powered-projects/</link>
      <description>We wanted to round up some of the coolest projects we’ve seen in the few short weeks since our API launch. Here&#39;s some of our favorites.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ICYMI, last month we <a href="https://blog.figma.com/introducing-figmas-platform-ee681bf861e7">released Figma Platform</a> with the first <a href="https://www.figma.com/developers/docs?utm_source=figma_blog&amp;utm_medium=link_in_post&amp;utm_campaign=platform_launch">Web API</a> for a professional design tool. We hoped the community would take this project in new directions, but didn’t know what to expect.</p><p>Well — your creativity didn’t take long to incubate. Within days, you flooded our Twitter timeline with impressive creations. From style guide generators to Alexa-Echo integrations, people are adapting the API to many workflows.</p><p>We wanted to round up some of the coolest projects we’ve seen in the few short weeks since our API launch. Thanks to those of you posting your work on our Show &amp; Tell channel on Spectrum, and special shout out to people open sourcing their projects for others to use.</p><p><em>Note: The integration creators provided the images and GIFs to Figma.</em></p><h2 id="integrations-to-excite-designers"><a href="#integrations-to-excite-designers">Integrations to excite designers</a></h2><p>These are the projects people built that can be used right off the bat by others — even those without programming skills. Stick a Figma URL in a website form, and make magic happen (keep in mind these are all 3rd party integrations, so Figma isn’t responsible for permissions’ settings or maintaining the integrations).</p><h3 id="_1-figma-pdf-exporter"><a href="#_1-figma-pdf-exporter">1. Figma PDF exporter</a></h3><p>With this new API integration you can export frames in your Figma designs as a PDF. Just select a frame, then copy paste the file URL into <a href="https://figma-pdf.gweltaz-calori.com/">this website form</a>. If you want to build an exporter for yourself, just fork the <a href="https://github.com/gweltaz-calori/Figma-To-Pdf">open-sourced</a> GitHub project built by <a href="https://github.com/gweltaz-calori">Gweltaz Calori</a>.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="_2-style-guide-generator"><a href="#_2-style-guide-generator">2. Style guide generator</a></h3><p>Paste a link to your Figma document on <a href="https://figstyle.freighter.studio/">this website form</a>, and this generator will build a style guide page based on all the fonts, colors and other styles you used. Read more details on how it works here <a href="https://spectrum.chat/thread/6dc219ab-4e4b-421d-842f-4bccab22652e">on Spectrum</a>, from its creator <a href="https://spectrum.chat/users/liammartens">Liam Martens</a>, Founder of Freighter design studio.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="_3-alexa-integration"><a href="#_3-alexa-integration">3. Alexa integration</a></h3><p>While we doubt any designer will actually use Alexa to read comments left on their design (feel free to prove us wrong), this example pushes the limits of what we imagined people building with Figma’s API. And if you hook your Figma account up to a similar voice activated function, show us what you do with it! It was built by Jon Gold, a Design Technologist at Airbnb.</p><h2 id="integration-inspiration-for-developers"><a href="#integration-inspiration-for-developers">Integration inspiration for developers</a></h2><p>Are you an engineer wondering where to start with the Figma API? A web-based design API can make it much easier to automate your design-developer handoff. Check out these projects for inspiration.</p><h3 id="_4-figma-js"><a href="#_4-figma-js">4. Figma.js</a></h3><p>In addition to an Alexa integration, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/figma-js">Jon Gold built an unofficial</a> library for using the Figma API in Javascript. The wrapper will help you get started quickly in building JS integrations with Figma. Jon’s wrapper is already being used for other programs, like an<a href="https://github.com/braposo/figma-graphql"> open-sourced GraphQL</a> connector that allows people to write GraphQL queries against the Figma API. The GraphQL connector was made by designer-developer <a href="https://bernardoraposo.com/">Bernardo Raposo</a> with help from <a href="https://iamsaravieira.com/">Sara Vieira</a>.</p><h3 id="_5-syncing-figma-designs-to-react-components"><a href="#_5-syncing-figma-designs-to-react-components">5. Syncing Figma designs to React components</a></h3><p>One of the API opportunities we are most excited about is the potential for automatically converting Figma to other frameworks. We’re already seeing it: PageDraw introduced a <a href="https://medium.com/pagedraw/pagedraw-figma-integration-5f99090ec1d4">React integration</a> for others to use, and Sara Vieira, a front end developer from Portugal, built a <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/3qlk2wk3v5">way for React components to be rendered directly</a> from a Figma file using the aforementioned GraphQL connector she worked on (💪).</p><figure></figure><p>Florian Nagel, software engineer at Candis, also created his own Figma →React converter, and he’s working on open-sourcing it.</p><h3 id="_6-volvo-car-mobility"><a href="#_6-volvo-car-mobility">6. Volvo Car Mobility</a></h3><p>To automate asset delivery, the design and development team at Volvo Car Mobility used the Figma API to simplify their workflow. With custom Slack commands, a designer or developer can initiate the process, and behind the scenes a web service creates a new branch in a GitHub repository.</p><p>From there, the web service uses the Figma API to export icons in a specific document with export settings for the frames that contain the icons. The user can view the event log and URL for the branch to create the pull request, all within Slack.

      <title>5 steps to nailing your portfolio presentation in design interviews</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/five-steps-to-nailing-your-portfolio-presentation-in-design-interviews/</link>
      <description>I’m a new grad myself and a designer, and I have a couple of suggestions that’ll help you nail your portfolio presentation.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let’s say you’re a talented rookie designer; the best in your class so to speak. You decide to go job hunting in the tech industry. Your website is polished, your work pixel perfect and judging by the amount of emails you received from recruiters, you’re doing a pretty good job.</p><p>All the necessary steps have been taken, you’re checking off the boxes on your employment to-do list, and everything’s going well.</p><p>But then comes your first presentation to a company’s hiring committee. Not all organizations require a formal presentation, but it’s become the norm for many. The interview panel usually consists of three to four designers (or ten to twelve depending on the company’s size and reputation), a recruiter, a manager and so on.</p><p>You showcase your work for them — explaining everything you have learned, everything that has prepared you for this moment. You dive into the inspiration and rationale for your decisions on an array of designs.</p><p>But then, you falter. You see everyone’s eyes glaze over as you go on tangents about complicated projects. Towards the end, they ask a ton of questions and then it’s over. You’re left unsure of whether you did a good job and hope for best as the day unfolds.</p><p>You’re not alone —the formal presentation is where most new grads trip in the long race to employment, literally inches before the finish line.</p><p>I’m a new grad myself, and part of my role as the Communications Designer at Figma is to be involved in the interview process for incoming design hires. So, in addition to having given my own, I sit in a lot of these presentations and take notes. If you feel stressed about these interviews, I have a couple of suggestions that’ll help you out.</p><h2 id="_1-start-slow"><a href="#_1-start-slow">1. Start slow.</a></h2><p>A job presentation is a performance of sorts. And like most performances, you shouldn’t start off the bat with props flying and giant musical numbers. Take the time to properly introduce yourself. Remember to state your name, and the type of design you’re good at.</p><p>There’s a lot of blogs out there about the demand for the multi-talented super employee. But as a new grad, you probably haven’t mastered every skill in the creative world. And that’s okay.</p><p>Be clear about what sets you apart. Is it:</p><ul><li>Typography</li><li>UX/UI design</li><li>Communications design</li><li>Motion graphics</li><li>Front end development</li></ul><p>Something else? You want the team to walk away with a clear sense of who you are, so don’t be afraid to emphasize your passion in your introduction. Later, you can mention other topics you were exposed to but don’t have expertise in. Eg, data visualization, CSS/HTML, etc.</p><p>Of course, if you’re a seasoned designer with tons of experience, this guidance might not apply to you. General experts should not be afraid to proclaim their broad talents to the room.</p><h2 id="_2-pick-which-project-you-loved-the-most-not-the"><a href="#_2-pick-which-project-you-loved-the-most-not-the">2. Pick which project you loved the most, not the one you spent the most time on</a></h2><p>I’ve noticed that new grads often start their presentations with elaborate projects, as though lengthy walls of text will impress the committee. Then, toward the end they show smaller-scoped projects that they’re far more passionate about.</p><p>I recommend beginning your presentation with the projects that tap into your inner child — they’re more authentic and playful. They’ll also represent your design sensibilities more accurately, as well as express who you are through your work.</p><h2 id="_3-the-dummies-guide-what-who-why-where"><a href="#_3-the-dummies-guide-what-who-why-where">3. The Dummies guide — What, Who, Why &amp; Where</a></h2><p>On that same note, give people a watered-down version of the design projects you worked on. The hiring committee doesn’t need to know every twist and turn of how things unfolded — that will just make their heads hurt.</p><p>Instead, focus on the bread crumbs: Provide a brief intro, present the problem, lay out the objectives, describe the execution, then reveal the final design and measures of success. Then move on to describing the next project.</p><p>If they’re interested or want to know more about a particular piece of work, they’ll ask questions. When in doubt, stick with the four W’s:</p><h3 id="what-is-this-project"><a href="#what-is-this-project">What is this project?</a></h3><p>Just because you wrote a carefully crafted artist statement in your presentation deck doesn’t mean everyone will read it. So, briefly introduce the project in a way, a simpler way. Bear in mind that not every person in the room will understand without context.</p><h3 id="who-worked-on-it"><a href="#who-worked-on-it">Who worked on it?</a></h3><p>This is vital. Distinguish yourself from your teammates by explaining what role you played in the making of the project. Otherwise, employers will be confused as to what you contributed or what you’re capable of.</p><h3 id="why-was-this-project-needed"><a href="#why-was-this-project-needed">Why was this project needed?</a></h3><p>Unless it’s a personal project, most of the assignments we work on are aimed at a specific problem. Clearly identify that problem and describe it vividly, so your audience identifies with the design challenge. Paint the scene.</p><h3 id="where-is-it-now"><a href="#where-is-it-now">Where is it now?</a></h3><p>Track your ideas as they come to life. How did your designs wind up being used? What impact did the project have? Are there metrics you can mention — like amount of signups driven? If your project wasn’t picked up, that’s fine too. Offer a hypothetical vision for what might have happened if it was. Companies like to see how the work you made could live beyond a deadline.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3f3158f3cfdf484de6eea32361bd7a9138665234-2000x1395.png?rect=0,0,2000,1394&amp;w=670&amp;h=467&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3f3158f3cfdf484de6eea32361bd7a9138665234-2000x1395.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3f3158f3cfdf484de6eea32361bd7a9138665234-2000x1395.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3f3158f3cfdf484de6eea32361bd7a9138665234-2000x1395.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3f3158f3cfdf484de6eea32361bd7a9138665234-2000x1395.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3f3158f3cfdf484de6eea32361bd7a9138665234-2000x1395.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="_4-be-wary-of-representing-the-company-you-re"><a href="#_4-be-wary-of-representing-the-company-you-re">4. Be wary of representing the company you’re pitching to</a></h3><p>Mimicry is a form of flattery, but there is a fine line between appeasing your employers and insulting them.</p><p>In your presentation, you may feel compelled to incorporate the brand of the company into your designs, but that can get a little tricky. You don’t know their usage guidelines and may unknowingly misrepresent their brand.</p><p>The very designers who made the components for the company might be the ones in the room interviewing you. And let me tell you, they didn’t spend months of design work on their pixel-perfect logo just to see it copy-and-pasted in the corner of your keynote. Think of it this way: in a game of “who wore it better,” the original designer will always win.</p><h3 id="_5-surviving-the-q-a"><a href="#_5-surviving-the-q-a">5. Surviving the Q&amp;A</a></h3><p>At the end of presentations, you’re going to face an onslaught of questions. These inquisitions are normal and not a sign that you screwed up. I’ve seen so many designers whither during Q&amp;A when they should be proud of the work they did and how far they’ve come.</p><p>The team’s job is to push and prod you so they understand you and your work. They want to challenge your design reasoning, your choice in color, your research, and a million other things, to see what informed your decisions. Don’t take it personally, and answer clearly, confidently and concisely. Keep in mind: You may be presenting a unique perspective. Perhaps the employer is taking the opportunity to learn from you in your job interview.</p><p>When all that’s said and done, breathe a sigh of relief — you made it through the ringer. By crafting your presentation to meet the needs of the interview committee, you’re doing what any good designer would: Empathizing with your users.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m the one-person marketing department over at Sounds app, a music video sharing service with 189k followers on Instagram and now over 150k likes on Facebook. The app connects with Spotify, Apple, and other platforms to allow users to add clips of music to their Instagram photos and stories. You could say social media, and especially social media outreach, is our bread and butter. But I’ll let you in on a little secret: Our metrics weren’t always this high.</p><p>When I was first hired our Facebook page was more of an afterthought. I’d post a few things here and there, mostly using it as a channel to drive fans back to our Instagram account. We’d only get about 20 likes per post at most and an average reach of about 500 of our 14k page fans. Going into the last quarter of 2017, however, our CEO Rhai Goburdhun asked me to focus on Facebook. Initially we had planned to outsource this to a creative agency. After interviewing quite a few we found out that it would’ve set the company back anywhere from $3k — $5k+ per month — not even including ad spend.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;h=379&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a398597fa6492afa34d2500932f831c7e1798aa-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1060w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Example of a Facebook post with low engagement</p><h2 id="here-s-the-sitch"><a href="#here-s-the-sitch">Here’s the sitch:</a></h2><p>A) We’re operating on a very tight budget.</p><p>B) My time is also split between community management, artist relations, and customer support (startups, amirite?! ;-)).</p><p>So, like any good startup, we decided to tackle it ourselves.</p><p>Step one was doing a content analysis of Facebook pages in the music/media/app space (shout out to TV Time and Unilad Sound!), to learn what types of posts had the highest engagement, and then using those findings to put together what types of posts we wanted for Sounds.</p><p>Step two entailed syncing with our designer Thomas to come up with a series of Sounds-branded templates that I could swap out with photos of the artists I was promoting. I assumed these would be Photoshop templates, but he had put everything together in the collaborative interface design tool Figma.</p><p>Thomas chose Figma because he knew it would be an easy tool for a non-designer to learn, thus perfect for a community manager to create and edit social media content. He explained to me that with other design tools, “the software isn’t always available on both Mac or Windows, it can be expensive to buy a license for casual use, and the UI is difficult to understand. Figma solves a lot of these problems.”</p><p>“It’s easily understandable for a non-designer, while still being very complete for a designer.” — Thomas Vimare, Lead Designer @ Sounds app</p><h2 id="she-s-a-figma-niac-that-s-for-sure"><a href="#she-s-a-figma-niac-that-s-for-sure">She’s a Figma-niac That’s For Sure</a></h2><p>He wanted a way to create marketing templates that could be easily edited by someone who doesn’t use design software everyday. As a non-designer who has only dabbled in Photoshop — mostly to troll friends with dumb photos I’d hack together — I initially found Figma’s interface to be a bit daunting. Luckily, Thomas is awesome, and he set up the workspace and templates in a very “Figma For Dummies” way. All it took was one Slack session and a brief screen grab video for me to get the hang of it.</p><p>Figma quickly became part of my daily social content creation process. I liked that I could now create posts immediately once I was struck by a creative idea, rather than having to wait for Thomas — who’s nine hours ahead of me at Sounds HQ in Paris — to read my Slack message and send something back. Figma empowers me to create social media content on a whim.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ca3bd7a21c171c5c8a83d3430843fec6640215f7-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;h=379&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ca3bd7a21c171c5c8a83d3430843fec6640215f7-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ca3bd7a21c171c5c8a83d3430843fec6640215f7-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ca3bd7a21c171c5c8a83d3430843fec6640215f7-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ca3bd7a21c171c5c8a83d3430843fec6640215f7-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ca3bd7a21c171c5c8a83d3430843fec6640215f7-1060x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1060w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>I started posting our Figma-created content to our Facebook page at the end of October, along with custom branch.io links to track which posts lead to the most app downloads. Even with just a tiny bit of ad spend (a max of $25/day split between Facebook and Instagram), I immediately noticed an exponential spike in reach and engagement.</p><p>Instead of 10–20 likes per post, I started seeing thousands of likes, comments, and shares per post. Our weekly reach started hitting over 1m, which is what our monthly reach used to be. And in less than 4 months, our number of Facebook page likes had quadrupled to 60k as of February 2018. Only a month later, and we’re at over 150k.</p><p>To be clear, with Facebook’s feed algorithm we still have to boost posts with a bit of ad spend (usually around $5/post, up to $10 if we see it’s performing really well) to reach our audience. But it’s costing a lot less, we’re seeing more enthusiastic discussions in the comments, and the audience reached with ad spend is sharing to their networks, so our overall organic reach is increasing.</p><p>If we had gone with an agency, we would’ve spent upwards of $20k in the same time frame. Instead, it’s cost a grand total of less than $3k in ad spend. For a lean startup, that sort of difference is huge for us, as it gives us much more budget to put back into other important areas of focus, such as tools that impact user retention and monetization in the app.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?rect=0,0,1399,800&amp;w=670&amp;h=383&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/abf3b6b93455d42e4cf9e66a7757d69bec86e40d-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="biggest-learnings"><a href="#biggest-learnings">Biggest Learnings</a></h2><p>After a few months of experimentation on our Facebook strategy, these are the key takeaways I have that could be helpful to anyone else who’s on a small marketing team and unsure of how to achieve social channel growth:</p><ol><li><strong>You don’t need to be a designer to create content.</strong> With the right tools (in our case, Figma) and a little creativity, having a set of templates optimized for each social channel makes it super easy to churn out daily content.</li><li><strong>You don’t need to be a marketer to do marketing</strong>. Before joining the Sounds team, I actually had very little traditional marketing experience (I come from an music app/editorial background, and was previously Editor-in-Chief of Band of the Day app for nearly 5 years). I’ve learned that marketing on social channels requires the same skill-set of knowing your audience and understanding what type of content best resonates with them.</li><li><strong>Limited resources doesn’t mean limited reach</strong>. I was doubtful that we’d be able to produce the same results in-house as an agency would have, especially with such little ad spend. But luckily I have a company that pushes for experimentation and learning from trial and error, which allowed me to figure out what would work for our channels without the pressure of “Oh man, what if I horribly fuck this up?!”<br/>–</li></ol><p><em>What tools do you use for creating social content?

      <title>Desperately seeking squircles</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/desperately-seeking-squircles/</link>
      <description>In a famous 1972 interview, Charles Eames answered a short sequence of fundamental questions about the nature of design.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is a story about one Figma engineer’s hunt for the perfect answer to a programming challenge. If it resonates with you, <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">we’re hiring</a>!</em></p><p>In a famous 1972 interview, Charles Eames answered <a href="https://www.eamesoffice.com/the-work/design-q-a-text/">a short sequence of fundamental questions about the nature of design</a>. Answering the first question, he defined design as “a plan for arranging elements to accomplish a particular purpose.”</p><p>His other answers are short, even quippy at times, but when asked about the role of constraint in design, he paused to give the longest and most considered response in the series: “Here is one of the few effective keys to the design problem: the ability of the designer to recognize as many of the constraints as possible; his willingness and enthusiasm for working within these constraints.”</p><p>Although I’m not a designer by trade — I’m an engineer who <a href="https://www.figma.com/">works on Figma</a>, the web-based collaborative design tool — it’s easy to see how Eames’ remarks apply to my work as well. Instead of arranging UI elements to make products, I arrange mathematical concepts expressed in code to implement tools and features. And constraints of time, simplicity, maintenance, and even aesthetics play a similarly dominant role in my process.</p><p>One recent project highlights these parallels exceptionally well. I was tasked with somehow adding support for Apple’s quirkily-named ‘squircle’ shape to Figma — with little else to go on, I got to work doing research.</p><p><strong>What unfolded was a mathematical odyssey, fraught with false starts, hidden problems, emergent constraints, exploration, tension and resolution.</strong> In short, it was a story every designer experiences, at some scale, almost every day.</p><p>To provide joy to math geeks like me and to illustrate how the design process unfolds when math is the medium, every step is presented below, from square one to shipping.</p><h2 id="the-squircle-smooth-operator"><a href="#the-squircle-smooth-operator">The squircle: Smooth operator</a></h2><p>My story begins long before I started at Figma, on June 10th, 2013, the day Apple released iOS 7. There was something subtle about the update: the home screen’s app chiclets had a juicier, more organic feel. They’d gone from squares with rounded corners, to <em>squircles</em> (a portmanteau of ‘square’ and ‘circle’).</p><p>What is the difference, you ask? To be fair, it’s slight — A squircle begins as the old rounded square, but with some sandpaper applied to the part where the rounding begins on each side of each corner so the transition from straight to curved is less abrupt.</p><p>Articulating this using mathematical language is precise: The curvature of a squircle’s perimeter is continuous, whereas a rounded square’s is not. This may seem trivial, a cool story, but subconsciously it really makes a big impact: a squircle doesn’t look like a square with surgery performed on it; it registers as an entity in its own right, like the shape of a smooth pebble in a riverbed, a unified and elemental whole.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a94289dee2f26a699f56f8f412b7e9370ab21d7-815x450.png?w=670&amp;h=370&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a94289dee2f26a699f56f8f412b7e9370ab21d7-815x450.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a94289dee2f26a699f56f8f412b7e9370ab21d7-815x450.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a94289dee2f26a699f56f8f412b7e9370ab21d7-815x450.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9a94289dee2f26a699f56f8f412b7e9370ab21d7-815x450.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 815w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>1.1 — Rounded squares vs squircles: it’s the little things, apparently!</figcaption></figure><p>For a long time, industrial designers making physical objects have known how important curvature is to an object’s perception. Try taking a careful look at the corners of a Macbook, or at an old-school, wired earbud case under a desk lamp. Notice how difficult it is to find an orientation where the corners have harshly contrasting highlights.</p><p>This is the result of curvature continuity, and it’s very deliberately included in the design. It’s no surprise that Apple, with fingers uniquely in both the hard and software pies, eventually cross-pollinated their interface designs with industrial ideas by making their icons look like the physical things they produce.</p><h2 id="from-form-to-formula"><a href="#from-form-to-formula">From form to formula</a></h2><p>Of course, at Figma we love iOS designers, and we feel our users should have the platform elements they need right at their fingertips. In order to give them access to this new shape while designing, we need to find a precise mathematical description so we can start figuring out how to build it into our tool.</p><p>Luckily, people have been asking this question for as long as iOS 7 has existed, and we are certainly not the first to walk this part of the journey! <a href="https://www.cocoanetics.com/2013/06/ios-7-icon-squircle/">Fundamental initial work</a> by Marc Edwards included a screenshot that indicated the icon shape was a particular generalization of an ellipse, called a superellipse. The following mathematical formula can describe circles, ellipses, and superellipses depending on how a, b, and n are chosen:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c98c6909ce7aebfbb021f79ad08aa4e27f8625de-164x41.png?w=670&amp;h=168&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c98c6909ce7aebfbb021f79ad08aa4e27f8625de-164x41.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 164w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>2.1 — Superellipse formula</figcaption></figure><p>If you choose, say, n = 2, a = 5 and b = 3, you get a normal ellipse with a major axis of 5 oriented along x and a minor axis of 4 oriented along y. Keeping n = 2 and choosing a = b = 1 describes a perfect unit circle. However, if you choose a value for n that is bigger than two, the result is a superellipse — the rounded elliptical shape starts blending into the shape of its bounding rectangle, with the corners becoming perfectly sharp in the limit that n goes to infinity. Early suggestions tried describing Apple’s shape with n = 5. If you <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=ParametricPlot%5B%7BSign%5BCos%5Bt%5D%5D+*+Abs%5BCos%5Bt%5D%5D+%5E+%282/5%29%2C+Sign%5BSin%5Bt%5D%5D+*+Abs%5BSin%5Bt%5D%5D+%5E+%282/5%29%7D%2C+%7Bt%2C+0%2C+2+*+Pi%7D%5D">try it out</a>, you’ll see it does look really close to what you’d find on a device running iOS 7+.</p><p>If this were the true description, we could just fit some reasonable number of Bézier segments to this shape and then do the delicate work of figuring out how to integrate this new concept into Figma. Unfortunately, though, <a href="https://applypixels.com/the-hunt-for-the-squircle/">careful follow-up efforts</a> showed that the superellipse formula wasn’t quite right (however, these days true superellipses <em>are</em> used as icons in other contexts). In fact, for all choices of n in the equation above, there is a small but systematic discrepancy when compared with the real icon shape.</p><p>This is the first blind alley in the story: We have an elegantly simple equation for something that looks a lot like an iOS squircle, but it’s fundamentally incorrect. And we really do owe our users the real thing.</p><p>Making headway requires some serious effort, and again I’m glad to harvest what others have sown. One investigator, Mike Swanson of Juicy Bits, made a hypothesis which builds up the squircles’ corners using a sequence of Bézier curves, <a href="https://blog.mikeswanson.com/post/62341902567/unleashing-genetic-algorithms-on-the-ios-7-icon">which he refined using a genetic algorithm</a> to optimize similarity with the official Apple shape. The results he obtained turned out to be right on, as proven with Manfred Schwind’s <a href="https://www.mani.de/backstage/?p=483">excellent direct approach</a>, which looks right at the iOS code which generates the icons. So we’ve got two different approaches yielding the same Bézier structure: iOS 7 Squircles were cracked and double checked by others, and we didn’t even have to calculate anything!</p><h2 id="a-spanner-in-the-works"><a href="#a-spanner-in-the-works">A spanner in the works</a></h2><p>Two important details remain, preventing us from cloning the shape directly into Figma and moving on:</p><p>First, there is the surprising fact that the iOS version of the formula (at least at the time of investigation) was found to have some quirks — the corners aren’t exactly symmetrical, and one side has a minuscule straight segment which clearly doesn’t belong. We don’t want that because it complicates both code and tests, but removing the extra segment is easily handled by just mirroring the bug-free half of the corner.</p><p>Second, when flattening the aspect ratio of the real iOS rectangle shape, it abruptly changes from the squircle we’re focusing on to a totally different sort shape. This would be unpleasant for a designer, and takes a strong point of view about what shapes ‘should’ be used under certain circumstances.</p><p>The most natural and useful behavior when flattening a squircle is for the smoothing to gradually disappear until there’s no room left to “sand” the transition between the round and the straight parts of the corner. Flattening even further should reduce the rounded section’s corner radius, which is in line with how Figma behaves today. The Apple squircle formula is of little help to us here, because its smoothing is done in a fixed way: it gives no indication for how to get nearer to or further from the old rounded rectangle. What we really need is a <em>parametrizable</em> smoothing scheme, where some particular value of the parameter corresponds very closely to the Apple shape.</p><p>As an added bonus, if we can parametrize the smoothing process that transforms a rounded square into a squircle, we can likely apply the same process to other places where corner rounding happens in Figma: stars, polygons, and even corners in arbitrary vector networks drawn with the pen tool. Despite the complication, this is beginning to look like a much more complete and valuable feature than simply adding support for iOS 7 squircles would have been. We are now giving designers an infinite variety of new shapes to use in many situations, and one of them happens to correspond to the squircle icon shape that got us started in the first place.</p><p>Requiring that our squircle smoothing scheme be continuously adjustable yet conform to the iOS 7 shape at some comfortable point its adjustible range is the first emergent constraint in our story, and it’s a difficult one to satisfy. An analogous task would be for a dancer to take a single still image of a ballerina in mid-flight, then design a leap in such a way that a movie of her executing it reproduces the image exactly at a precise point in time. Which sounds freaking hard. So maybe some calculation will be necessary after all?</p><p>Before diving into parameterizing squircles, let’s take a step back and dust off some formal tools that will help us analyze what’s going on. First of all, we need to settle on <em>how</em> we’ll describe a squircle. When discussing superellipses before, we used an equation involving x and y, where all the points (x, y) in the plane which satisfy the equation implicitly trace out the superellipse. This is elegant when the equation is simple, but real squircles are a patchwork of Bézier curves spliced together, which leads to unmanageably messy implicit equations.</p><p>We can deal with this complication by using a more explicit approach: take a single variable t, restrict it to a finite interval, and map each value which t can take on that interval to a distinct point on the squircle perimeter (Bézier curves themselves are almost always represented this way, in fact). If we concentrate on just one of the corners, thereby restricting our analysis to a curved line with a clear beginning and end, we can choose the mapping between t and the corner such that t = 0 corresponds to the beginning of the line, t = 1 corresponds to the end of the line, and smoothly sliding t between 0 to 1 smoothly traces out the round part of the corner. In mathematical language, we will describe our corner by the path r(t), which is structured as</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/85024a496d4e1ebf10397c94a2a338c56ad343df-317x23.png?rect=1,0,314,23&amp;w=670&amp;h=49&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/85024a496d4e1ebf10397c94a2a338c56ad343df-317x23.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 314w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>4.1 — Plane curve bijection with [0,1]</figcaption></figure><p>where x(t) and y(t) are separate functions of t for the x and y components of r.

From the path r(t) we can differentiate to get the velocity v(t) and acceleration a(t):</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b546fbf1cbeff346148d88d88c84a04fd88f40e2-366x49.png?rect=1,0,365,49&amp;w=670&amp;h=90&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b546fbf1cbeff346148d88d88c84a04fd88f40e2-366x49.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b546fbf1cbeff346148d88d88c84a04fd88f40e2-366x49.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 365w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>4.2 — Plane curve velocity and acceleration</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, the mathematical curvature, which plays a starring role in our story, can in turn be expressed in terms of the velocity and acceleration:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c5903456f494d89dd484a321a86a8cf0b142120d-184x52.png?w=670&amp;h=189&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c5903456f494d89dd484a321a86a8cf0b142120d-184x52.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 184w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>4.3 — Unsigned curvature of plane curves</figcaption></figure><p>But what does this formula really mean? Though it may look a bit complicated, curvature has a straightforward geometric construction, originally due to Cauchy:</p><ol><li>The center of curvature C at any point P along the curve lies at the intersection of the line normal to the curve at P and another normal line taken infinitesimally close to P. (As a side note, the circle centered at C as constructed above is called the <em>osculating circle</em> at P, from the Latin verb <em>osculare</em>, meaning ‘to kiss’. 😙 Isn’t that great?)</li><li>The radius of curvature R is the distance between C and P.</li><li>The curvature κ is the inverse of R.</li></ol><p>As constructed above, the curvature κ is nonnegative and doesn’t distinguish between rightward and leftward turns. Since we do care about this, we form the signed curvature k from κ by assigning a positive sign if the path is turning right, and a negative sign if the path is turning left. This concept too has an analogue in the car picture: at any point t, the signed curvature k(t) is just the angle through which the steering wheel has been turned at time t, with plus signs used for turns to the right and minus signs for turns to the left.</p><h2 id="geometry-is-king-arc-length-parametrization"><a href="#geometry-is-king-arc-length-parametrization">Geometry is king: Arc length parametrization</a></h2><p>With curvature introduced, we have a last couple wrinkles to iron out. First, consider for a moment two cars driving along a squircle corner shaped route; one car keeps speeding up and then braking the entire way (🤢), while the other car smoothly speeds up then coasts down to a halt at the end. These two different ways of driving will yield very different path histories even though the exact same route was taken. We only care about the shape of the corner, not how any one driver negotiated it — so how can we separate the two? The key is to use not time to label the points in the history, but rather the cumulative distance traveled, or arc length. So instead of answering questions like ‘where was the car ten minutes into its trip?’, we’d rather answer ‘where was the car ten <em>miles</em> into its trip?’. This way of describing paths, the arc length parameterization, captures their geometry alone.</p><p>If we have some path history r(t) in hand, we can always extract the arc length s as a function of t from the path by integrating its speed, as follows:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40ae31e45ffbe7f6b24d46323c1761af4f20ce6a-183x53.png?w=670&amp;h=194&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40ae31e45ffbe7f6b24d46323c1761af4f20ce6a-183x53.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 183w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>5.1 — Arc length integral</figcaption></figure><p>If we can invert this relationship to find t(s), then we can substitute this for t in our path history r(t) to get the desired arc length parameterization r(s). The arc length parameterization of a path is equivalent to a path history made by a car driving at unit speed, so unsurprisingly the velocity v(s) is always a unit vector, and the acceleration a(s) is always perpendicular to the velocity. Consequently, the arc length parameterized version of curvature simplifies to just the magnitude of acceleration,</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ff5c23a24b982bee2bc47b1c6cbc0cddca717645-122x23.png?w=670&amp;h=126&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ff5c23a24b982bee2bc47b1c6cbc0cddca717645-122x23.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 122w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>5.2 — Curvature in the arc-length parametrization </figcaption></figure><p>and we can tack on the appropriate right or left handed sign to form the signed curvature k(s). Most of the complication in the more general curvature definition was evidently there just to cancel out the non-geometric content in the path history. Curvature is, after all, a purely geometric quantity, so it’s really pleasing to see it look simple in the geometric parameterization.</p><h2 id="design-the-curvature-compute-the-curve"><a href="#design-the-curvature-compute-the-curve">Design the curvature, compute the curve</a></h2><p>Now for the other wrinkle: we’ve just seen how to go from a path-history description of a curve r(t) to its arc length parameterization r(s), and how to extract the signed curvature k(s) from it. But can we do the reverse? Can we design a curvature profile and from it derive the parent curve? Let’s consider the car analogy again — suppose that as we were driving at constant unit speed along a route, we recorded the position of the steering wheel continuously throughout the journey. If we took that steering data and gave it later to another driver, they’d be able to reconstruct the route perfectly, so long as they played back the steering wheel positions properly and drove exactly the same speed. So we see intuitively that we have enough information to reconstruct the parent curve, but how does the computation look mathematically? It’s a little bit hairy, but it’s still possible, thanks to Euler, using the arc length parameterization — if we choose a coordinate system such that the curve starts at the origin and has its initial heading directed along the x axis, then x(s) and y(s) can be reconstructed from k(s) as follows:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a766e50995a65ac0d3830ba14cb16bc63bbe08e-340x133.png?w=670&amp;h=262&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a766e50995a65ac0d3830ba14cb16bc63bbe08e-340x133.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a766e50995a65ac0d3830ba14cb16bc63bbe08e-340x133.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>6.1 — Recovering a curve from its curvature</figcaption></figure><p>Last, note the argument of the sine and cosine functions above: it is the integral of the signed curvature. Normally, the arguments supplied to trigonometric functions are angles measured in radians, and that turns out to be true in this case as well: the integral from a to b of the signed curvature is the heading at b minus the heading at a. Thus, if we start with a square and sand off the corner in whatever crazy way we want, then measure the curvature over the part we sanded and integrate up the result, we’ll always get π/2.</p><h2 id="squircles-under-the-scalpel"><a href="#squircles-under-the-scalpel">Squircles under the scalpel</a></h2><p>Now that we are wrinkle-free, let’s see what happens when we apply these analytical tools to some real shapes.

As we’ll see later, there’s a tradeoff between having a smooth curvature plot and having a small number of Bézier curves, and the iOS corner only uses three. Generally, designers would rather deal with fewer Bézier curves at the expense of having a mathematically perfect curvature profile. These details aside, we can kind of squint at the plot on the right and see a general picture emerge: the curvature ramps up, flattens in the middle, and then ramps back down.</p><h2 id="breakthrough-smoothing-parameterized"><a href="#breakthrough-smoothing-parameterized">Breakthrough: Smoothing parameterized</a></h2><p>Bingo! In that last observation lies the key to how we can parameterize the smoothing of our squircle corner. At zero smoothing, we want a curvature profile like the rounded rectangle: tabletop shaped. As smoothing slowly increases, we want the height of the tabletop to stay fixed while its cliff edges start turning into steep slopes, yielding an isosceles trapezoidal curvature profile (still with a total area of π/2, of course). As smoothing approaches its maximum, we want the flat part of the trapezoid to disappear, leaving us with a broad isosceles triangular profile whose peak height is that of the original tabletop.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2648862f95a51661e06d454f7d1ff833640e7321-800x500.png?w=670&amp;h=419&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2648862f95a51661e06d454f7d1ff833640e7321-800x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2648862f95a51661e06d454f7d1ff833640e7321-800x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2648862f95a51661e06d454f7d1ff833640e7321-800x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2648862f95a51661e06d454f7d1ff833640e7321-800x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>8.1 — Curvature profiles for various values of the smoothing parameter</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s try to express this sketch of a curvature profile in mathematical terms, using ξ as a smoothing parameter which varies between zero and one.

In Figma, continuous paths must be representable by cubic Bézier curves (of which quadratic Bézier curves and lines are special cases) and this limits us to keeping only cubic and lower order terms. This means that the series above for x(s) and y(s) must each be truncated to a single term. It’s hard to have much confidence that such a drastic truncation will retain the properties we like.</p><p>Sadly, discarding higher-order terms is not sufficient — the resulting construction performs very poorly when ξ is large. We can see this below in the figure drawn for ξ = 0.9:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e749b541a2869eaaeedc2252e68c75173d48e704-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e749b541a2869eaaeedc2252e68c75173d48e704-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e749b541a2869eaaeedc2252e68c75173d48e704-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e749b541a2869eaaeedc2252e68c75173d48e704-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e749b541a2869eaaeedc2252e68c75173d48e704-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>9.3 — Squircle corner at ξ = 0.9 using third-order clothoids and circular arcs</figcaption></figure><p>This shape is clearly unusable. It seems three orders isn’t enough to keep the curvature increasing throughout the ramp up and ramp down sections of the parameterization, meaning that we have a ton of accumulated error by the time we get to the circular section. Sadly, this means that all of our clothoid results are unusable, and we have to go back to the drawing board.</p><h2 id="nothing-gold-can-stay"><a href="#nothing-gold-can-stay">Nothing gold can stay</a></h2><p>Let’s take a step back, consider our constraints again, and try to extract what we can from the previous efforts before heading off in a new direction.</p><p>First, we know that the perfect clothoid construction has exactly the curvature profile we need, but the center of curvature of the central circular section changes location as a function of the smoothing parameter ξ. This is undesirable because our current on-canvas rectangle rounding UI uses a dot right at the center of curvature which a user can drag to set the corner radius. It might feel a bit weird if that dot moved as the smoothing varied. Also, the iOS shape’s central section is right where it would be if it were just a rounded rectangle, further implying total independence of the center’s location from ξ. So we can keep the same basic curvature design goal and add the constraint that the circular section keep a fixed center of curvature as ξ varies.</p><p>Second, we know that designers don’t want the construction of the squircle corner to be too complicated. Apple’s squircle (after removing the weird tiny straight part) has only one Bézier curve connecting its circular section to the incoming edge, so maybe we can construct the same type of thing?</p><p>Thirdly, we have a somewhat arcane technical constraint which isn’t apparent at the outset, but that becomes a major implementation issue. To approach this, let’s consider a square, 100px by 100px, which has vanilla corner rounding applied for a corner radius of 20px. This means that each side of the square’s perimeter has 60px of straight track. If we flatten the square into a squashed rectangle so that it’s 80px by 100px, then the straight section of the short side will be only 40px long. What happens when we flatten the square so much that we run out of straight section? Or if we flatten it more, so that the rectangle is, say, 20px by 100px? Figma’s present behavior is to figure out the largest value of corner rounding we have room to apply and then draw the shape using that instead. Our 20px by 100px rectangle would thus have 10px of rounding applied.</p><div><blockquote><p>If smoothing corners with radius R and parameter ξ consumes p pixels, then the function p(R,ξ) must be invertible to ξ(R,p).</p></blockquote></div><p>Any smoothing process we might use to create a squircle will eat up even more of the straight edge than simple rounding does. Imagine the case above again, a 100px by 100px rectangle, apply 20px of rounding, and then apply some smoothing procedure which removes 12 more pixels from the straight sides. This leaves us with a 36px budget in the straight section for flattening. What happens when flattening the rectangle to 60px by 100px? It seems almost obvious, by analogy, that we should back off the smoothing until the budget is balanced and the straight portion is exactly consumed. But how do we compute the value of ξ which satisfies a specific pixel consumption budget? We must be able to do this quickly or we can’t implement the feature.</p><p>Again, this problem has a very precise mathematical articulation: If smoothing corners with radius R and parameter ξ consumes p pixels, then the function p(R,ξ) must be invertible to ξ(R,p). This is a somewhat hidden constraint which would also have ruled out a high order clothoid series solution.</p><p>Finally, we have a usability constraint, which is that changing the smoothing should actually do something perceptible to the shape. If we yank the smoothing parameter ξ back and forth between zero and one, it better make a visible difference! Imagine we did all this work for something that people can barely see — it’s unacceptable. This is fundamentally a requirement of usefulness, and as such it’s obviously the strongest constraint.</p><h2 id="keep-it-simple-squircle"><a href="#keep-it-simple-squircle">Keep it simple, squircle</a></h2><p>Let’s try the most direct thing we can think of that meets the constraints listed above and just try to pick a single parameterized Bézier curve that takes the circular portion and links it up to the straight side. The figure below shows a type of Bézier curve suitable for this purpose:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/caf09729f626ba46f59d52f577f36b561f8dead3-750x350.png?rect=0,0,749,350&amp;w=670&amp;h=313&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/caf09729f626ba46f59d52f577f36b561f8dead3-750x350.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/caf09729f626ba46f59d52f577f36b561f8dead3-750x350.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/caf09729f626ba46f59d52f577f36b561f8dead3-750x350.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/caf09729f626ba46f59d52f577f36b561f8dead3-750x350.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 749w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>11.1 — Cubic Bézier control points for the ramp-up part of the squircle</figcaption></figure><p>A few of its properties merit further explanation. First, control points 1, 2 and 3 all fall in a line. This ensures that the curvature at point 1, which connects to the straight part of the squircle, is exactly zero. Generally speaking, if we define a coordinate system and associate point 1 with P1, point 2 with P2, and so on, the curvature at point 1 is given by:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/448087fc769aa24885ab491dac8d037a27056823-273x60.png?w=670&amp;h=147&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/448087fc769aa24885ab491dac8d037a27056823-273x60.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 273w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>11.2 — Unsimplified curvature at point 1 from figure 11.1</figcaption></figure><p>We can see, reassuringly, that the cross product vanishes when points 1–3 are collinear. This same formula can be applied to point 4 by labeling in reverse; doing so and plugging in the geometry and the labels in the figure gives the following for the curvature there:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d89f5dc9e229fce5bfed844d63579726b537ff55-161x58.png?w=670&amp;h=241&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d89f5dc9e229fce5bfed844d63579726b537ff55-161x58.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 161w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>11.3 — Simplified curvature at point 4 from figure 11.1</figcaption></figure><p>Ideally, this would be the same as the curvature of the circular section, or 1/R, which provides us one more constraint. Finally, the values of c and d are fixed by the fact that the end of this curve has to meet the circular portion and be tangent to it where it joins, which means the curvature constraint above just gives us the value of b:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a7e3bc34c754c5cf3474f9c5353a367ad93fe933-155x58.png?w=670&amp;h=251&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a7e3bc34c754c5cf3474f9c5353a367ad93fe933-155x58.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 155w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>11.4 — Solution for b from figure 11.1 which delivers curvature continuity</figcaption></figure><p>If we find it important to preserve the initial linear increase in curvature (which the ideal clothoid solution featured at point 1) we can set a equal to b, which fixes all of the points on the Bézier curve and gives us a potential solution. Using these observations, we construct a simple Bézier squircle below using a smoothing of ξ = 0.6:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9203f6086bfda6b1cd671da20c03a38a85ed5b3a-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9203f6086bfda6b1cd671da20c03a38a85ed5b3a-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9203f6086bfda6b1cd671da20c03a38a85ed5b3a-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9203f6086bfda6b1cd671da20c03a38a85ed5b3a-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9203f6086bfda6b1cd671da20c03a38a85ed5b3a-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>This looks pretty good, and it takes a lot of cues from the original clothoid calculation. Unfortunately, the variation over the full range, from ξ = 0 to 1 only makes a very subtle difference in the corner shape. Here we’ll show the corner at two zoom levels, with curves for ξ = 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 shown in different colors:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aaaf30e57d0047ff8542bc05edfb102dcf74a256-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aaaf30e57d0047ff8542bc05edfb102dcf74a256-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aaaf30e57d0047ff8542bc05edfb102dcf74a256-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aaaf30e57d0047ff8542bc05edfb102dcf74a256-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aaaf30e57d0047ff8542bc05edfb102dcf74a256-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>This is a barely noticeable effect despite its nice mathematical properties. It’s certainly closer to being a product than the curve we got by truncating the clothoid series that we considered previously. If we could only tweak the formula a little bit to get some more variation!</p><h2 id="small-strokes-of-sqluck"><a href="#small-strokes-of-sqluck">Small strokes of sqluck</a></h2><p>We can take one more small step back to figure out how to proceed. Recalling that we need an invertible relationship between pixels consumed in smoothing and the smoothing parameter ξ, we can focus initially on this mapping, make it as simple as possible, and see what comes out when we try to make a parametrization of squircles from it.</p><p>We know something already about how simply rounding the corners consumes pixels. I won’t walk through the trigonometry necessary, but taking a corner of opening angle θ and rounding it to have a radius of R pixels will consume q pixels of the edge from the apex of the corner, with q given as follows:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cffc0ef4df084841fa6a69d9314d1321e751405d-166x53.png?w=670&amp;h=214&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cffc0ef4df084841fa6a69d9314d1321e751405d-166x53.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 166w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>12.1 — Segment length consumed by rounding</figcaption></figure><p>What if we choose p(R,ξ) based on q in just the simplest possible way, something like:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/59788dcc69ae402e2c5d8f1e9f185c73e6cfe0ab-119x23.png?w=670&amp;h=129&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/59788dcc69ae402e2c5d8f1e9f185c73e6cfe0ab-119x23.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 119w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>12.2 — Segment length consumed by rounding and smoothing</figcaption></figure><p>All this means is that our maximum smoothing setting will consume again the length of segment that we consumed in rounding normally. Making this choice would fix the quantity a + b from the figure above. Recall that in any circumstance c and d are firmly fixed, so fixing a + b means there is one final decision to make: how large is a relative to b? Again, if we make the simplest choice, namely a = b, we have determined another modified Bézier parameterization, whose corners and curvatures we show below:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75eec2efcc35516832c4d47574acce3196e7795e-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75eec2efcc35516832c4d47574acce3196e7795e-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75eec2efcc35516832c4d47574acce3196e7795e-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75eec2efcc35516832c4d47574acce3196e7795e-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75eec2efcc35516832c4d47574acce3196e7795e-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>12.3 — Corner shape and curvature profile for simple smoothing scheme</figcaption></figure><p>That visual variation looks promising! The curves look attractive, sanded in a way. However the curvature profile looks pretty rough. If we could just make it a bit less spiky, it might be a serious contender for a product. Despite the poor curvature profile, even this simple family of shapes has a member that looks extremely similar to the Apple version of the squircle, almost close enough to put in front of our users without a bad conscience.</p><p>Now we turn to the curvature profile, our last outstanding problem. Rather than splitting the difference evenly between a and b as we did above, why don’t we give two thirds of the interval to a and the remaining third to b? This will throttle the curvature from increasing too quickly, reducing the long tails on the curvature profile and cutting at the spikes. This modification results in the following shapes:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/49ff32ad3449a7ba6ba8a60503c13862909e06f3-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/49ff32ad3449a7ba6ba8a60503c13862909e06f3-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/49ff32ad3449a7ba6ba8a60503c13862909e06f3-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/49ff32ad3449a7ba6ba8a60503c13862909e06f3-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/49ff32ad3449a7ba6ba8a60503c13862909e06f3-1000x500.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>12.4 — Corner shape and curvature profile for improved simple smoothing scheme</figcaption></figure><p>The curvature profiles are much improved, the visual degree of variation is still enough for this to be a useful product, ξ = 0.6 just about nails the iOS shape, and the nice visual character of the curves which this stunningly simple approach generates is retained. So we must ask the question — what’s blocking this from becoming the product? Nothing.</p><h2 id="watching-the-ship-sail"><a href="#watching-the-ship-sail">Watching the ship sail</a></h2><p>It’s useful here, at the end, to reflect on the process itself. Something I see borne out repeatedly in this story is the power and effectiveness of trying the simplest possible thing. Doing so will, in the worst case, give a baseline for comparison if the simplest thing ends up not working out. Evaluating it in a serious way also shines a light on the most important things we need to consider when refining the approach and moving forward. And in the best cases, like ours, the simplest thing happens to be pretty good already!</p><p>Lastly, there is a meditation on the difference between a good product and a perfect one. I feel some pangs of embarrassment writing this that I was unable to come up with a better curvature profile. I’m sure I could have given more time — there are many avenues left to explore. Intellectually, it’s somewhat unsatisfying to have gotten such a beautiful result as the clothoid series but not to have been able to at least see a reflection of that in the spline we shipped in the end. But there’s also the wider context — the constraints of time when working at a small company are very real — and a design which violates these cannot be considered good.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we’re excited to launch the <a href="https://www.figma.com/developers">Figma Platform</a>, a way to improve design workflows by connecting Figma to other tools, scripts and even web apps. <strong>We’re starting off with a new concept for the design space: A web API.</strong></p><p>It’s crazy that a web API is groundbreaking in 2018, but to our knowledge, no one has ever created one for a professional design tool before. The reason? Design traditionally takes place in a world of siloed, offline desktop software, whereas Figma lives online where everything is connected.</p><p>By harnessing the open nature of the web, our API lays the foundation for unique forms of design collaboration. Companies are already using it to craft custom tools that meet their unique needs. For example, Uber created a live feed of what their design team is working on to raise visibility across the organization. GitHub automated part of their icon creation process to improve its efficiency.</p><div><blockquote><p>Our API lays the foundation for unique forms of design collaboration</p></blockquote></div><p>Those ideas are just the beginning — we’re open sourcing a number of demo projects ranging from a Figma spell checker to a generative art tool to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fMUngXFXQY&amp;feature=youtu.be">method for putting your designs</a> on the Ethereum blockchain. We’re also introducing new and improved integrations with other design tools like <a href="https://avocode.com/?lng=en">Avocode</a>, <a href="https://www.haiku.ai/">Haiku</a>, <a href="https://zeplin.io/">Zeplin</a> and <a href="https://pagedraw.io/">Pagedraw</a>.</p><p>We’re most excited to see what our community will make. Read on to learn more about how our platform works and ways to <a href="https://www.figma.com/developers">get started</a>. (And check out Harry McCracken’s <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90165051/as-design-and-engineering-blur-figma-wants-to-be-their-platform">excellent Fast Company article</a> about our API’s significance for the broader tech industry.)</p><h2 id="how-it-works"><a href="#how-it-works">How it works</a></h2><p>The first release of the Figma Web API has three core capabilities:</p><ol><li>Read design files in an open JSON file format</li><li>Read/Write comments to design files</li><li>Render design files (and parts of design files) into standard image formats (png, svg, etc)</li></ol><p>Our open file format allows third party tools to consume Figma designs in a reliable way. Unlike our desktop competitors, Figma’s Web API isn’t tied to operating systems, specific file paths or versions of design software. This means it’s possible to access the current state of a design from software running on entirely different computers, or even on the web like Figma itself — setting the stage for an entirely new class of design integrations.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5173ea00298728296d86bcdb1f00637448fd2fbf-800x532.png?rect=0,0,799,532&amp;w=670&amp;h=446&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5173ea00298728296d86bcdb1f00637448fd2fbf-800x532.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5173ea00298728296d86bcdb1f00637448fd2fbf-800x532.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5173ea00298728296d86bcdb1f00637448fd2fbf-800x532.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5173ea00298728296d86bcdb1f00637448fd2fbf-800x532.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Uber employee looks at a real-time feed of designs fed to a TV by Figma’s API</figcaption></figure><p>Once you know the unique key of a Figma design — which is contained in the URL — you can extract a live snapshot of the tree of shapes, text, components, prototype links, transitions, constraints, etc that define how a Figma design looks and behaves. You can also ping an endpoint to generate a JPG, PNG or SVG of any file or file subtree.</p><p>We’ve designed the API to be as ergonomic as possible so it’s fast and easy to script improvements to internal company workflows or integrate Figma with other tools. Because it’s web-based, you don’t need to learn esoteric scripting languages to do this. You can rely on the programming frameworks you’re familiar with and interface directly with a well defined web API rather than bind yourself unnecessarily to another proprietary plugin framework. (This will make it easier to keep integrations up to date — and therefore less buggy!)</p><p>We know you’re wondering what’s coming up soon. Here’s a preview:</p><ol><li><strong>Webhooks.</strong> Next we plan to release Webhooks that stream callbacks to events in Figma. You can attach a Webhook to a file or team. You’ll get back events mapping to file updates.</li><li><strong>Write API.</strong> While our Comment API allows clients to write to Figma, today’s release is mostly about enabling read cases and opening Figma up to the outside world. We plan to introduce a Write API later this year… it’s something we’re super excited about!</li><li><strong>Extensions.</strong> If we had $1 for every time customers requested in app extensions, we might not have needed to raise our last round of funding. That said, we have watched as our competitors added extension models which granted developers freedom at the expense of quality, robustness and predictability. We’re eager to leverage the incredible collective brainpower of the Figma community in making our tool better, but we’re not going to introduce extensions until we are confident our extension model is robust. There’s no ETA just yet, but we are actively exploring how to build this in a solid way.</li></ol><h2 id="take-workflow-inspiration-from-uber-github"><a href="#take-workflow-inspiration-from-uber-github">Take workflow inspiration from: Uber &amp; GitHub</a></h2><p>As design plays a growing role at big companies, more and more departments touch it. It’s not just the UI person who interacts with mockups and visual conceptions of ideas — so do copy-editors, engineers, researchers, marketers, executives and countless others.</p><p>This snowballs into big problems. Traditional desktop design tools weren’t built for collaboration, so it’s painful for people to work together on designs. Files must be exported and uploaded before they can be shared, and thus they’re immediately out of date when the original design changes. Leaders can’t easily see and comment on real-time work; engineers spend hours hunting down the right assets; teams wrestle with problems that — unbeknownst to them — many others solved in previous contexts.</p><p>For true collaboration at scale, enterprises need a better way to share, search and see real-time designs across the entire organization. That’s why we’re so excited about the promise of custom workflows fueled by Figma’s API.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a6f605f34e3c730ca4face4187e5c1182caad34f-800x400.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a6f605f34e3c730ca4face4187e5c1182caad34f-800x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a6f605f34e3c730ca4face4187e5c1182caad34f-800x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a6f605f34e3c730ca4face4187e5c1182caad34f-800x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a6f605f34e3c730ca4face4187e5c1182caad34f-800x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>An Uber designer works in Figma</figcaption></figure><h2 id="uber"><a href="#uber">Uber</a></h2><p>The <a href="https://www.uber.com/">on-demand ridesharing service</a> boasts a design team spread across 4 different cities, working on a diverse array of products from Uber Eats to Uber Freight. Its new VP of Design wanted an easy way to browse these projects, so they’re creating internal tools for visibility with our web-based technology.</p><p>“Figma’s API has helped bring ideas we have dreamt about for ages to life,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/eklimcz?lang=en">Erik Klimczak</a>, Senior Design Manager for Uber’s <a href="https://www.uber.com/info/atg/">Advanced Technology Group</a>.</p><p>Uber is planning to broadcast in-progress designs on TVs around the office, surface them through a Dribbble-like website repository and load designs on a Chrome browser extension for employees. Designers will have the autonomy of deciding when to share — the API won’t pick up their work until they drag it into a particular frame in Figma.</p><div><blockquote><p>Figma’s API has helped bring ideas we have dreamt about for ages to life.” — Erik Klimczak, Sr. Design Manager, Uber</p></blockquote></div><p>Other companies have made similar products to facilitate the sharing of design work, but this is the first time we’ve seen anyone create a real-time feed based on an online source of truth instead of a messy export flow. We found the magnitude of Uber’s effort inspiring, and we hope to see more teams explore similar concepts.</p><h2 id="github"><a href="#github">Github</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e5e07bbe641e8de58921fb1344cbeb7e06f6f199-800x400.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e5e07bbe641e8de58921fb1344cbeb7e06f6f199-800x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e5e07bbe641e8de58921fb1344cbeb7e06f6f199-800x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e5e07bbe641e8de58921fb1344cbeb7e06f6f199-800x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e5e07bbe641e8de58921fb1344cbeb7e06f6f199-800x400.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The GitHub Octicon set in Figma (left) and GitHub (right)</figcaption></figure><p>With the new Figma API, GitHub can push changes to their icon system — Octicons — from a single design file. When someone needs to alter an icon, they can simply edit the Figma file, which serves as the source of truth. A designer or engineer can then submit a pull request with a reference to the updated Figma design. This triggers a new build via Travis CI which uses Figma’s API to automatically extract icons from the Figma file and publishes the updated icon set in each format.</p><p>Driving the changes from a single design file reduces the barrier for contributing said changes. It also allows GitHub to run everything via common continuous integration services rather than setting up Mac servers. In the future, when Figma releases our Write API, GitHub plans to make data flow bidirectionally so the repository and design file are always in sync. This way anyone will be able to make changes to the Octicons icon set in the way they feel most comfortable, whether that’s design or code!</p><h2 id="a-new-world-of-integrations"><a href="#a-new-world-of-integrations">A new world of integrations</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3d0fe4b0d1d01ff8f17b9da222e43ab9dc86d35-800x333.png?w=670&amp;h=279&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3d0fe4b0d1d01ff8f17b9da222e43ab9dc86d35-800x333.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3d0fe4b0d1d01ff8f17b9da222e43ab9dc86d35-800x333.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3d0fe4b0d1d01ff8f17b9da222e43ab9dc86d35-800x333.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3d0fe4b0d1d01ff8f17b9da222e43ab9dc86d35-800x333.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>In addition to helping companies like Uber and Github customize their own workflows, our API will make it easier for third parties to build — and maintain — public Figma integrations. <a href="https://zeplin.io/">Zeplin</a> just issued an overhaul of their integration with our new API, and three other products have introduced Figma functionality for the first time:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.haiku.ai/">Haiku</a> — a tool for creating interactive, cross-platform UI components (available today)</li><li><a href="https://pagedraw.io/">Pagedraw</a> — a production ready React UI code generator (available today)</li><li><a href="https://avocode.com/?lng=en">Avocode</a> — developer handoff tool (coming soon)</li></ol><p>Integrations like these are more important than ever before for design.

      <description>Over the years product design has adopted many engineering best practices.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the years product design has adopted many engineering best practices. But when it comes to reviewing and documenting changes, designers are limited by their desktop tools. To access version history, they must use friction-filled workarounds and export files.</p><p>That’s not the case with Figma. Because our tool is web based, your files are constantly saved, and you never have to sync. This continuous stream of version history is great for tracking your progress. That said, with so many versions listed it’s not always easy to see when important changes were made to a file.</p><p>Shortcut: ⌘ + ⌥ + S (Mac) and Ctrl+ Alt + S (Windows)</p><p>Today we are introducing simple but powerful functionality — Figma Version History — that allows you and your collaborators to organize your Figma file history. You can manually flag particular versions and save notes about each stage of design as you go. That way, you can revert to certain milestones — like how your design looked before its first critique, or which version of a design you first ran user tests on. You can easily restore these important versions or duplicate them into new files.</p><h2 id="better-workflow"><a href="#better-workflow">Better workflow</a></h2><p>There are several benefits to this new way of working in Figma.</p><p>1) <strong>Better organization</strong>: By saving particular milestones, you’ll make your Version History easier to parse. Any autosaves that occur between manually saved versions will automatically collapse, so you can skim the history of your design without getting lost in the clutter. See below for a concrete example of the old way (left) and the new way (right).</p><div><blockquote><p>Hot tip: Never seen your version history before? Click your file’s name and “Show Version History” to pull it up</p></blockquote></div><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/783d6fd28c1bc7c5db8a61b4f079d7cb4866bc66-800x616.png?w=670&amp;h=516&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/783d6fd28c1bc7c5db8a61b4f079d7cb4866bc66-800x616.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/783d6fd28c1bc7c5db8a61b4f079d7cb4866bc66-800x616.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/783d6fd28c1bc7c5db8a61b4f079d7cb4866bc66-800x616.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/783d6fd28c1bc7c5db8a61b4f079d7cb4866bc66-800x616.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Old Figma Version History (left) ; New Version History (right)</figcaption></figure><p>2) <strong>Versions for pages</strong>: Previously, you could only see your Version History for your entire file, even if changes were made on different pages. Now, you can manage your Version History on a per page view. That will make it easier to track changes without getting lost in the noise.

We hope this will reduce the time spent reviewing work, and help your team reach a better outcome, faster.</p><p>4) <strong>New shortcut alert</strong>: We know you love your keyboard shortcuts, so here’s a new one.

This can have a huge impact, across the span of an entire design system because it can help keep components contained and reduce the number of components required.</p><p>Another recent update introduced drag and drop instance swapping. This can take place locally within your file, or straight from your shared team library (a separate Figma document). Being able to do this can have a huge impact how you structure your components.</p><p>Here are a few ideas on how you can maximize modularity, and in some cases, reduce the number of components required.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How to hit the road as a UI/UX digital nomad</title>

      <description>Does your soul die a little each time you climb the subway steps of your morning commute?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Does your soul die a little each time you climb the subway steps of your morning commute? Do you dream of endless beaches, poolside conference calls, and waking up in a new city whenever the mood strikes? Lucky for you, the lifestyle of the digital nomad is on the rise.</p><p>Remote work is having its moment thanks to cheap airfare deals, plentiful WiFi and data options, and a grossly overpriced housing market. So, we spoke with three traveling designers to learn how they mastered the globe-trotting hustle. Read on to learn about budgeting for the unpredictable, finding new clients while on the road, and keeping a client’s trust despite major time zone differences.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/783a874ee825a30b5eeaa06fea094ad479c3c90f-2000x1111.png?rect=0,0,2000,1110&amp;w=670&amp;h=372&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/783a874ee825a30b5eeaa06fea094ad479c3c90f-2000x1111.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/783a874ee825a30b5eeaa06fea094ad479c3c90f-2000x1111.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/783a874ee825a30b5eeaa06fea094ad479c3c90f-2000x1111.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/783a874ee825a30b5eeaa06fea094ad479c3c90f-2000x1111.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/783a874ee825a30b5eeaa06fea094ad479c3c90f-2000x1111.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="step-one-prepare-prepare-prepare"><a href="#step-one-prepare-prepare-prepare">Step one: Prepare, prepare, prepare</a></h2><p>Photo by Javier Cuello</p><h3 id="find-clients-before-fleeing-town"><a href="#find-clients-before-fleeing-town">Find clients before fleeing town</a></h3><p>Each panelist forged their own nomadic path, but all three agreed it’s best to secure clients or an employer before starting out. Don’t book that one way ticket without at least a smidgen of financial security. Plus, it will be easier convincing people to hire you when you’re still in their time zone, and when you’re not stressed about a dwindling savings. If possible, meet them in person several times so you have a better understanding of their communication styles and business needs. This will lessen the likelihood of future mishaps.</p><p>Not sure where to find those clients? Here are a few ways to bulk up your professional network in advance of leaving:</p><ol><li>Attend design meetups and tech gatherings. Introduce yourself as a design freelancer and hand out your card with your portfolio link on it.</li><li>Post your services on Craigslist. May seem old school, but this is a quick way to rack up new clients.</li><li>Avoid immediately telling prospective clients you’re going abroad. Finish a solid project or two for them first to build up trust, before asking if they want to work with you while you travel.</li><li>Tap your professional network to let them know you’re taking on new clients. Don’t be afraid to routinely reach out with these reminders as time goes on.</li></ol><h3 id="get-the-pieces-in-place-to-run-a-business"><a href="#get-the-pieces-in-place-to-run-a-business">Get the pieces in place to run a business</a></h3><p>What do you need to run a freelance business? Miguel Oliva Márquez advises figuring this out before you head out of town. Once you’re on-the-go, it’s extremely difficult to do basic tasks, like registering a business name in your home country. You don’t want to spend your first few days of freedom faxing documents from Thailand to London.</p><h2 id="a-few-things-to-consider"><a href="#a-few-things-to-consider">A few things to consider:</a></h2><ol><li>Create an LLC so you can take business-related deductions on your tax bill</li><li>Set up a separate business checking account to track freelance income</li><li>Make a website with your portfolio and contact information</li><li>Create promotional items like business cards so you can easily connect with prospective clients you meet abroad</li><li>Work with an accountant so you’re prepared to manage your freelance finances (and not get hit with an insane tax bill you weren’t ready for)</li><li>Register your business’ name</li></ol><h3 id="make-sure-there-s-solid-wifi-wherever-you-re"><a href="#make-sure-there-s-solid-wifi-wherever-you-re">Make sure there’s solid WiFi wherever you’re headed</a></h3><p>Digital nomads need to access the Internet for conference calls, emails, and — if you’re a Figma user — design.</p><p>Every nomad we talked to handles this differently. Javier Cuello values good WiFi so much that he avoids traveling the countryside, where connection is spotty. Miguel, on the other hand, keeps a backup sim card so he can hotwire his phone on the go.</p><p>Do your research. Check if your Airbnb will have an Internet connection and scour the reviews for complaints. You can even ask the Airbnb host to take a speed connection test and send you a screenshot of the results. If you’re not positive what the WiFi connection will be like, make sure to warn clients you could be out of reach. Setting expectations will go a long way for maintaining your reputation.</p><p>Yes, we’re a little biased, but we recommend using Figma if you’re going to work abroad. It will be far easier to share files with clients with our URLs — no need to export and email the latest version. They can check in on your progress without needing to bother you, and leave comments in the design itself.</p><p>Pro tip: You can work on a Figma file without WiFi, if you remember to open it (and leave it open) before you lose your Internet connection.</p><h2 id="step-two-hit-the-road"><a href="#step-two-hit-the-road">Step two: Hit the road</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e833c958b7eec20593e89a593047bc29d85822c3-702x870.png?w=670&amp;h=830&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e833c958b7eec20593e89a593047bc29d85822c3-702x870.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e833c958b7eec20593e89a593047bc29d85822c3-702x870.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e833c958b7eec20593e89a593047bc29d85822c3-702x870.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e833c958b7eec20593e89a593047bc29d85822c3-702x870.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 702w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Now that you’ve spent a few months preparing, it’s time to hit the road. You’ll need to adapt to each place you stay, figuring out creative ways to find new clients or tap into the local design community. Here’s a few things to consider.</p><h3 id="finding-your-digital-tribe"><a href="#finding-your-digital-tribe">Finding your digital tribe</a></h3><p>It can get lonely hoofing it around the world, so designer Allison Shiman recommends hitting up Facebook groups for digital nomads as soon as you arrive in a new city. She recommends joining Digital Nomads Around the World and introducing yourself once you reach a new home. She also recommended a few female-specific ones, such as Female Digital Nomads and Digital Nomad Girls.</p><p>If you want to stay in a city with a strong traveler community, Allison says to check out Hanoi in Vietnam, Chiang Mai in Thailand, and Ubud in Bali. All three have solid WiFi, a high quality of living, and an abundance of coworking spaces and coffee shops. For a more regimented experience, you could always try out Roam or Remote Year, both similar to studying abroad programs but for professionals.</p><h3 id="handling-clients-old-and-new"><a href="#handling-clients-old-and-new">Handling clients old and new</a></h3><p>When you’re halfway across the world from your pre-existing clients, you must work to maintain the trust and transparency between you. Miguel Oliva Márquez sends a daily email updating each client on what he did that day and schedules calls with them every two days. It might seem like overkill, but these updates give the clients an opportunity to get their questions answered and reminds them he’s a valuable member of the team. Despite the regular check-ins, he reminds us that “it’s good to remember why you’re doing this. If you work too much, then you miss out on enjoying living in another country.”</p><p>If you’re looking to score new gigs once abroad, get creative. Allison has done everything from cold-emailing companies to scouring local entrepreneurship or tech Facebook groups. At one point she joined the Bitcoin Chiang Mai Facebook group to ask if anyone needed a UI/UX designer for their crypto app.</p><h3 id="budget-for-the-unpredictable"><a href="#budget-for-the-unpredictable">Budget for the unpredictable</a></h3><p>Just because you’re traveling the world doesn’t mean you should chuck your personal finance goals. Keep building your nest egg by putting away savings and contributing to your retirement savings — you never know when you’ll come down with dengue fever and won’t be able to work for awhile.</p><p><strong>How to do this?</strong></p><ol><li><em>Bounce between expensive and cheaper countries</em>. Miguel said he’d balance out a month-long stay in Australia with a few weeks in a tiny Japanese village. He’s actually saving more money as a designer abroad and constantly on the move than as a designer paying $1,300 pound per month for a flat in London.</li><li><em>Check out apartments in the less trafficked or touristy neighborhoods of a city</em>. Allison found more culturally vibrant streets — and affordable rooms — on the outskirts of town. It’s OK if Lonely Planet has yet to write about the nearest coffee shop.</li></ol><h2 id="step-three-adapting-back-to-home-sweet-home"><a href="#step-three-adapting-back-to-home-sweet-home">Step three: Adapting back to home sweet home</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ccd60de8053c12c76158455d86e39c456b307baa-728x874.png?w=670&amp;h=804&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ccd60de8053c12c76158455d86e39c456b307baa-728x874.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ccd60de8053c12c76158455d86e39c456b307baa-728x874.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ccd60de8053c12c76158455d86e39c456b307baa-728x874.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ccd60de8053c12c76158455d86e39c456b307baa-728x874.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 728w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Life on the road for an extended period of time is wearisome even for the most nimble nomad. Eventually, most crave setting down roots again. The wonderful thing about working while traveling is you’ll have a roster of clients to help land you on your feet wherever you drop anchor.</p><p>After four years of hopping from city to city, Javier dreams of living in a van retrofitted with a kitchen, bathroom, and personal workspace, while Miguel believes he has about two or so years of nomadism left in him.</p><p>Allison, three months in and at the beginning of her journey, says, “It can be challenging and it can be lonely, but I love the freedom of traveling. Don’t lose sight of what you’re passionate about and what drove you to go on this journey in the first place.”</p><p>Thanks so much to Javier Cuello, Allison Shiman, and Miguel Oliva Márquez for their time and knowledge.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cc0871955a9933a397420a868cb58a3be1f81762-740x956.png?w=670&amp;h=866&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cc0871955a9933a397420a868cb58a3be1f81762-740x956.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cc0871955a9933a397420a868cb58a3be1f81762-740x956.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cc0871955a9933a397420a868cb58a3be1f81762-740x956.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cc0871955a9933a397420a868cb58a3be1f81762-740x956.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 740w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Photo by Allison Shiman</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma prototyping: now with transitions</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-prototyping-now-with-transitions/</link>
      <description>Design involves far more than just the designer these days.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Design involves far more than just the designer these days. Engineers, marketers, project managers, and other stakeholders collaborate until the best product emerges. To do this efficiently, teams rely on prototypes — high-fidelity representations of an app — to communicate about a mockup before it’s shipped to engineers.</p><p>The feel of an app can be completely changed by something as fundamental as the animation between frames. Without those details in place, stakeholders are at risk of becoming thrashed with incessant back and forth. Who has time for that?</p><h2 id="learn-how-to-prototype-in-figma-with-these-two"><a href="#learn-how-to-prototype-in-figma-with-these-two">Learn how to prototype in Figma with these two videos</a></h2><p>That’s why we’re excited about today’s news: We’re introducing transitions for Figma prototyping. As you build a clickable prototype of your design, add a <strong>dissolve, slide, or push</strong> effect to link frames to each other. This will make the prototype’s transitions feel more realistic to the viewer, whether that person is a developer, prospective client, or a relative who still doesn’t understand what you actually do for a living.</p><figure></figure><p>Want to “slide” from one frame to the next over a duration of a few milliseconds? Now you can. Need to mimic the animated motion of an iOS app to bring it to life and impress a new client? Handled.</p><p>These transitions are essential for getting your ideas across, and you have been clamoring for them with a flood of feedback via Spectrum and Twitter. Our community has requested this functionality nonstop since we first announced Figma 2.0 with prototyping.</p><p>As we promised back then, we will continue to build prototyping in Figma to meet the needs of everyone involved in the software development process.</p><h2 id="what-makes-figma-prototyping-faster-and-easier"><a href="#what-makes-figma-prototyping-faster-and-easier">What makes Figma prototyping faster and easier?</a></h2><p>For the unfamiliar, Figma prototyping has super powers that other tools lack (💪).</p><ol><li><strong>Live design</strong>: Because we’re a web-based platform, your prototypes automatically stay up to date. They’re tied to your designs, so when you make a few tweaks to your frames, there’s no need for you to re-export them to your prototype.</li><li><strong>Figma TED talk</strong>: You can use your phone’s web browser on Android and iOS to navigate presentations via mobile. It’s Figma TED talk— allowing you to casually walk around the room guiding the demo from your phone. This is particularly useful during client meetings. Stakeholders can click your avatar in the Figma prototype (observation mode), then follow along with your design flow from their own laptops.</li><li><strong>Components + prototyping</strong>: Use Figma components in your prototypes to save a ton of time. When you set a navigation from a component once, it will automatically populate through all instances. For example, your home button will always bounce you back to your home screen.</li></ol><p>In addition to the existing prototyping features, we hope our new transitions will add an extra layer of polish to your work. You can choose the duration of the animation, and play around with how one frame will ease into another. This means you have control over when an animation is slightly faster at the beginning, or at the end.</p><p>Lastly, the prototyping toolbar has a preview box, so designing the transitions between frames is a snap. (Or a slide.)</p><p>Be sure to check out this video to learn the basics of prototyping in Figma. And when you’re ready to introduce transitions to your prototypes head over here.</p><h2 id="what-s-next"><a href="#what-s-next">What’s next?</a></h2><p>We hope this continuation of our prototyping tool helps designers communicate their vision easier, faster, and with more joie de vivre.</p><p>Much like with our recent workflow launch of @mentions and file sorting, we’re constantly noodling on how to save all team members time. Have an idea for a new Figma feature? Give us a shout over at Spectrum or on Twitter. We’re always listening.</p><p>And stay tuned for more prototyping announcements. 😉</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Don’t worry, it’s not a box of chocolates hastily wrapped in newspaper or a dozen day-old roses with a post-it love note.</p><p>For a belated V-Day present, we’re giving you functionality you have been requesting for so long. We built these small but mighty features to save precious minutes in your design workflow. The first is the oft-requested @mention: now you can grab a team member’s attention and invite them into a file, pointing them directly to where you need feedback. The second feature is file sorting. To enable these features, refresh your Figma tabs.</p><h2 id="organize-your-workflow-with-file-sorting"><a href="#organize-your-workflow-with-file-sorting">Organize your workflow with file sorting</a></h2><p>Most file list views in Figma are automatically sorted by “Last Modified.” This approach is useful if you have recently active files in a project, but it limits you otherwise. So, we’re now allowing you to sort your files by date created as well as alphabetically by file name.</p><p>We hope this feature will make it easier to find what you’re looking for in Figma, so go forth and organize!</p><h2 id="streamline-your-design-collaboration-with-mentions"><a href="#streamline-your-design-collaboration-with-mentions">Streamline your design collaboration with @mentions</a></h2><p>Collaboration in a design workflow can take many forms. In Figma, you have the unique ability to share a live design file or prototype with another designer or stakeholder.</p><p>However, collaboration often takes place asynchronously:</p><ul><li>A designer makes changes to a work-in-progress and wants to draw her PM’s attention to it for feedback — no longer will she need to draw a huge arrow in her Figma design so stakeholders know where to look</li><li>An engineer goes to implement a modal and realizes she has questions about the Figma prototype linked from the task tracker</li><li>A copy editor makes changes to prose and wants to let the designer know he is done</li></ul><div><blockquote><p>“Now I know what comments to focus on.” — Val Klump, copywriter at Gusto</p></blockquote></div><p>This is usually when we reach for comments. They’re not frequently used as general broadcasts — instead, they’re a way to give information to or request feedback from a specific person. Just one problem: previously in Figma, there was no seamless way to alert people to comments directed at them. You had to send them a link to the document and tell them to hunt down the comment you just left. 🙈</p><p>With today’s release of @mentions, you’ll be able to get people’s attention a little more easily. As in many other collaboration tools and social networks, you can tag a person by typing the <code>@</code> symbol and their name, and that user will get an email about the comment, as well as a notification in Figma itself.</p><p>Pro tip: you can reply to comment notification emails, and it will add your new comment to the thread in Figma!</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b41aef9a69e09ebb3791d2e8b89385c4937c92b2-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b41aef9a69e09ebb3791d2e8b89385c4937c92b2-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b41aef9a69e09ebb3791d2e8b89385c4937c92b2-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b41aef9a69e09ebb3791d2e8b89385c4937c92b2-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b41aef9a69e09ebb3791d2e8b89385c4937c92b2-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>💕💖💓</p><p>We hope these features streamline your process when working in Figma. As always, keep sharing the feature releases you would be most excited to see from us. Our vocal users are why these two oft-requested functionalities are now live. 🎉</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Web design without a web designer? Xfive turns to Figma.</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/web-design-without-a-web-designer-xfive-turns-to-figma/</link>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since 2006, Xfive has gone from a two-man startup with a few remote contractors to a thriving web development shop with offices in Krakow, Melbourne, and San Francisco. The company provides development services to digital agencies, startups, and enterprise companies alike.</p><p>Two years ago, Xfive rebranded itself and launched a new website. Since then, the business has continued to rapidly progress, while parts of its website — including the homepage — lagged behind.</p><p>Several prominent areas like Customers and Work were simply outdated, but more fundamental issues were at hand — including a confusing navigation scheme, a multitude of CTAs vying for attention, and a swarm of landing pages to navigate (and maintain).</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a9facb55d7b86df5133e724bdd0d09c6dfbb3a8-710x1182.png?w=670&amp;h=1115&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a9facb55d7b86df5133e724bdd0d09c6dfbb3a8-710x1182.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a9facb55d7b86df5133e724bdd0d09c6dfbb3a8-710x1182.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a9facb55d7b86df5133e724bdd0d09c6dfbb3a8-710x1182.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2a9facb55d7b86df5133e724bdd0d09c6dfbb3a8-710x1182.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 710w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Issues with the homepage</figcaption></figure><p>Due to the nature of their work, Xfive does not usually employ designers. Typically, clients provide the designs and Xfive executes on development.</p><p>Enter Lubos Kmetko, an Xfive content producer. Lubos had recently taken Figma for a test-drive as part of writing two comparison articles covering best UI design tools for Windows and best tools for designer-developer workflow.</p><p>Not a designer by trade, Lubos felt confident that he could handle the redesign with Figma. But he needed to make sure all stakeholders had a platform for reviewing comps and submitting feedback.</p><h2 id="prototyping-and-collaborating-in-figma"><a href="#prototyping-and-collaborating-in-figma">Prototyping and collaborating in Figma</a></h2><p>Lubos used Figma to redesign the Homepage, Customers area, and Work sections of the website, which included streamlining the global navigation and reducing the number of CTAs and landing pages.</p><p>After creating mockups of each page, Lubos sent a preview link to various stakeholders spanning marketing, sales, production, editorial, and development. Even the chief operating officer wanted to review and feedback on the proposed changes.</p><p>Since Figma is 100% cloud-based, anyone with a browser could review and comment on the designs. “It was as simple as sending a link to the stakeholders,” said Lubos.</p><p>The team jumped into review the comps, using the Comments tool to exchange ideas and offer input. Often, Lubos was incorporating feedback in real time and/or explaining design and user interaction ideas to the team — all within Figma. Meanwhile, all feedback, changes, and updates were stored and remained in sync.</p><p>“By far, Figma offers the best workflow among the current UI design tools, especially when combined with prototyping and commenting,” said Lubos.</p><p>Milosz Bazela, COO and Head of Xfive, especially liked the ability to view and comment on mockups within the browser. “Thanks to Figma, it was easy for everybody — from marketing managers to copy writers — to access designs at all stages of development and to provide very specific feedback,” said Milosz.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670&amp;h=549&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1360eede41d6491ff56689d875c58c1d9c8d6b48-1340x1098.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Number of comments pertaining to revised pages in Figma.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="streamlining-designer-developer-workflow"><a href="#streamlining-designer-developer-workflow">Streamlining designer-developer workflow</a></h2><p>Once comps were approved, it was time for the designer-developer handoff. “Figma works great for designer-developer collaboration and, during this project, it really proved itself,” said Lubos. Instead of sending files to developers via email or Box, and worrying about version control, Lubos shared designs via Figma.</p><p>Developers opened Figma in the browser and used Code Mode to inspect design files without using external tools like Avocode and Zeplin. Through Figma, they could inspect and export CSS as well as iOS and Android code.</p><p>“With Code Mode, I got all the specs I needed — whether it was size, color, or padding — which removed any guesswork and helped me code faster and more accurately,” said Aleksandra Worhacz, Front-end Developer at Xfive.</p><p>“The way Figma supports collaboration is simply amazing. It’s like Photoshop married Google Docs. But, surprisingly, Figma is much lighter and simpler,” added Artur Kot, Front-end Developer at Xfive.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbc67fb9cf4e25c096e91f5696503c89e5da6c77-1276x826.png?rect=0,0,1275,826&amp;w=670&amp;h=434&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbc67fb9cf4e25c096e91f5696503c89e5da6c77-1276x826.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbc67fb9cf4e25c096e91f5696503c89e5da6c77-1276x826.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbc67fb9cf4e25c096e91f5696503c89e5da6c77-1276x826.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbc67fb9cf4e25c096e91f5696503c89e5da6c77-1276x826.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dbc67fb9cf4e25c096e91f5696503c89e5da6c77-1276x826.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1275w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Figma’s code mode.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="just-the-beginning"><a href="#just-the-beginning">Just the beginning…</a></h2><p>For Xfive, this is just the beginning. Using Figma for its redesign became an important testing ground for using Figma on client projects. Lubos imagines creating and sharing functional prototypes with teammates and clients and collaborating in real time — instead of the “old way,” (attaching PDFs and JPEGs to an email in order to communicate functional design ideas).</p><p>“From sharing design prototypes, to discussing implementation details, to developer handoff, Figma makes collaborating so much easier,” concludes Lubos.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today’s news: I’m thrilled to announce we raised a $25 million Series B led by Kleiner Perkins’ newest partner, Mamoon Hamid. We’re looking forward to working with Mamoon (and excited to be his first investment at KPCB). He’s known for making prescient early bets on SaaS companies like Slack, Box and Intercom, in part due to his data-driven investment thesis and go-to-market expertise. Our existing investors — Danny Rimer at Index, John Lilly at Greylock and LinkedIn’s Jeff Weiner — joined the round as well (❤).</p><p>Five years ago, we started Figma with the simple belief our tools should empower us not limit us. We believed that creation should be accessible and collaborative rather than exclusionary and siloed. Adopting a new way of working is a journey, one that can get messy and takes time; we’re thankful to everyone (users, employees, investors) who supported our vision early.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma announces design system meetups in 6 cities around the world</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-announces-design-system-meetups-in-6-cities-around-the-world/</link>
      <description>Are you building a design system at your company (and facing some roadblocks)?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Are you building a design system at your company (and facing some roadblocks)? Come share your war stories at Figma-sponsored meetups around the world. We chose 6 initial cities for these design system events, and held our first one last week in Lagos, Nigeria. Over 300 people came out for it (😲!), so we’re excited to see how the rest unfold.</p><h2 id="the-full-list"><a href="#the-full-list">The full list:</a></h2><p>Lagos, Nigeria (1/27)<br/>Toronto, Canada (2/23)<br/>Bangalore, India (Details coming soon)<br/>Amsterdam, Netherlands (Details coming soon)<br/>New York, United States (Details coming soon)<br/>Los Angeles, United States (Details coming soon)<br/>These meetups were made possible by our community, which submitted thousands of responses to our questionnaire back in November when we launched DesignSystems.com. You came out in force to volunteer as hosts or partners, and we couldn’t have put together these international gatherings without your support.</p><p>Some of you may remember we originally planned them as dinners. Given the overwhelming flood of interest, we realized we’d shut out fellow designers from attending if we capped the events to dinner-sized groups.</p><p>So, we switched to the meetup approach. Where possible, someone from Figma will fly out to speak and meet with local designers. Each city will adapt the meetup for their community, and include presentations from local designers on design systems.</p><h2 id="our-first-stop-was-lagos-nigeria"><a href="#our-first-stop-was-lagos-nigeria">Our first stop was Lagos, Nigeria</a></h2><p>The burgeoning design scene in Lagos drew our attention months ago, thanks to the vocal community of Figma users in Nigeria. (It’s home to the largest concentration of our users in Africa.) The tech industry in Lagos is expanding, as companies like Andela and hotels.ng establish their presence in Africa and abroad.</p><p>We were excited to learn that Figma plays a unique role in Lagos’ tech ecosystem. Because we’re the only design tool that offers a free tier and runs in the cloud, we make it easier for people to incorporate design into the process of building digital products. They can access Figma designs anywhere from their work computer to the local Internet cafe.</p><p>The Lagos meetup was organized by one particularly passionate Figma user — hotels.ng designer, Namnso Ukpanah. He invited designers from hotels.ng, Andela, and Paystack to speak at the event, along with Figma’s CEO Dylan Field.</p><p>We’re choosing cities where designers volunteered their time as hosts — it really does take a village. If you want to see a meetup in your city, please tell your design community to shout their interest over at DesignSystems.com. Or better yet, sign up and become a host. If you would like details about the meetups already scheduled, email marketing@figma.com with the subject line “Design Systems.”</p><p>Last but not least, we synthesized the data from the meetups and questionnaire to create something entirely new. We’re launching a more comprehensive DesignSystems.com soon. Stay tuned!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma Quality Week: Inside our bug bashing party</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-quality-week-inside-our-bug-bashing-party/</link>
      <description>What&#39;s involved in a &#34;spring cleaning&#34; of the product?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In early 2017, shortly after I joined <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, the team kicked off its first official “Quality Week.” Everyone at the company paused their projects for a major spring cleaning of the product. Engineers and designers alike addressed a bunch of smaller, “not mission critical but annoying nonetheless” bugs, and made much-needed improvements to existing features.</p><p>At the time I was surprised that such a fast-moving startup would invest resources in this, but I soon learned why quality matters so much at Figma. Designers spend hours on end using our tool, so the smallest imperfections can compound.</p><p>By spending an entire week exclusively dedicated to fixing bugs — instead of continuing to ship at all costs — we try to deliver a faster, smoother and more intuitive tool for all the designers, developers, marketers, and product managers out there.</p><p>It’s grunt work that matters, and it brings a great deal of satisfaction to us personally.</p><h2 id="quality-week-2018"><a href="#quality-week-2018">Quality Week 2018</a></h2><p>We decided to make Quality Week an ongoing Figma tradition so that’s how we started 2018. Two teams of engineers joined forces to work on a broad selection of bugs, prioritizing features that were legitimately broken or not up to par for a professional grade design tool. For a full list of the improvements, check out our <a href="https://releases.figma.com/">release notes</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>We call this one the &#34;WTF&#34; bug</figcaption></figure><p>Here are some highlights I was most excited by:</p><ol><li><strong>Figma Mirror</strong> — Our mirroring app, which reflects Figma designs on phones to see how they feel natively — should be more stable and crash less.</li><li><strong>Sketch import</strong> — Sketch files can now be dragged and dropped directly into the editor window. Text objects in Sketch files should also import far more accurately.</li><li><strong>Chromebook</strong> — We’re thinking a lot more these days about our Chromebook users (many of whom are students). Now, they can use the search key + drag to duplicate objects.</li><li><strong>Layer panel</strong> — Layers should more intuitively nest into groups and frames when you move them.</li></ol><p>Is Figma bug-free? Did we get to fine-tune everything we wanted? No, but we promise to keep working at it. The <a href="https://releases.figma.com/">list we tackled was huge</a>, and we’re thinking about adding more quality weeks throughout the year.

      <title>How to convince your team to switch to Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-convince-your-team-to-switch-to-figma/</link>
      <description>Convincing your team to change design tools isn&#39;t always easy</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Convincing your team to switch to <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a>, the collaborative online design platform, isn’t always easy. Open design represents a cultural shift, from design siloes to collaboration.</p><p>So, here to offer some pro tips on the transition is <a href="https://twitter.com/moreofmorris?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">James Morris</a>, senior designer at the popular social media management app <a href="https://buffer.com/">Buffer</a>. James took a step-by-step approach to moving Buffer to Figma, making sure he had company-wide support for the change. Buffer’s team is entirely remote, so they needed a design tool that simplified communication.</p><p>But for James, introducing Figma was about more than just a new tool. It was about shifting design’s role in the engineering-driven organization. “How can you help the design team have a place at the table by default?” he said. “How can you make design part of the discussion?”</p><h2 id="buffer-s-commitment-to-transparency"><a href="#buffer-s-commitment-to-transparency">Buffer&#39;s commitment to transparency</a></h2><p>It’s not surprising Buffer was drawn to Figma, because a core tenet of its culture is transparency — to the point that the company publishes all its employees’ salaries online. Despite that, its design team struggled to work with other departments, according to James. The tools they used trapped them in a separate world.</p><p>Members of other teams had trouble finding the designs they were looking for, since files were often buried deep in Dropbox subfolders. Once they located them, they couldn’t see designs without buying the software that powered them, or upgrading to new versions. Even with the right license, developers and product managers were often afraid to open designs in case they accidentally saved over someone’s work.</p><p>“You realize the tool of choice really has a massive effect on the communication. It puts a wall up around the design team as though it has these special files no one can touch,” James said. “Figma promotes the opposite feeling. We’re there just a tap away.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76926dbbe3e7c736085c3e696d5d4520dd3cde7f-800x509.png?w=670&amp;h=426&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76926dbbe3e7c736085c3e696d5d4520dd3cde7f-800x509.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76926dbbe3e7c736085c3e696d5d4520dd3cde7f-800x509.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76926dbbe3e7c736085c3e696d5d4520dd3cde7f-800x509.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/76926dbbe3e7c736085c3e696d5d4520dd3cde7f-800x509.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Buffer file structure in Figma</figcaption></figure><p>He explained that because Figma runs in the cloud, the collaboration issues disappear. Anyone can be given access to a design file via its URL, and teams can have unlimited view-only accounts (that are free!), where viewers can leave comments and pull data from designs to code them.</p><p>“We have engineers who are using Linux and much of the design software out there doesn’t support this platform,” James said. “One person was prepared to buy a Mac just so he could open design files! At that point, the benefits of Figma were crystal clear.”</p><h2 id="step-1---open-exploration"><a href="#step-1---open-exploration">Step 1 - open exploration</a></h2><p>Just because Figma’s value seemed obvious to James, that didn’t mean it was clear to the rest of the organization. He knew the best way to rally support was to show, not tell. With a company wide email, he introduced a ‘period of exploration,’ asking teams to experiment with different design and collaboration tools to see what met their needs.</p><p>During this time, James took in feedback about Buffer’s workflow challenges and solutions. He lobbied for the ways Figma could fix these issues, including detailing the benefits in the original memo he sent out. Ultimately, James trusted that once people tried Figma, the collaboration features would prove themselves.</p><h2 id="step-2---show-don-t-tell"><a href="#step-2---show-don-t-tell">Step 2 - show, don&#39;t tell</a></h2><h3 id="whiteboarding-sessions-with-product-managers"><a href="#whiteboarding-sessions-with-product-managers">Whiteboarding sessions with product managers</a></h3><p>During this exploration period, James used creative methods to help teams and individuals explore Figma. Since Buffer is remote, an easy first step was virtual whiteboarding. James is based in England, so he convinced one of Buffer’s Canadian PMs to brainstorm a feature with him.</p><p>“We both drew different ideas, like how people would collaborate in a Google Doc, except with shapes instead of words,” James said. “Figma showed itself very quickly, it’s incredibly easy to pick up.”</p><p>Because they used Figma to work together in real-time, James didn’t have to sit around waiting for a formal spec sheet from the PM.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?rect=0,0,1600,1065&amp;w=670&amp;h=446&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/474eb192d6aa1a5b92ef1983e27bf8e7ce904c9f-1600x1066.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>James Morris, Buffer Senior Designer</figcaption></figure><h3 id="convincing-the-engineers"><a href="#convincing-the-engineers">Convincing the engineers</a></h3><p>To persuade Buffer’s developers to get on board, James left them to their own devices. “I said, ‘Guys, check this out. Here’s the URL, see if you can get the information you need,’” James remembered. “They got really excited by just being able to open it up.”</p><p>Developers can use Figma’s free view-only tier to view CSS, iOS (Swift), and Android (XML) data in the design. All they need is a link to the file to open it — a far cry from the Photoshop era of downloading and paying for an unwieldy application.</p><div><blockquote><p>Engineers got really excited by just being able to open Figma up.</p></blockquote></div><p>“One of the Figma selling points for them was the source of truth. I could create a URL for a particular design, and that could be easily shared and that URL would stay the same,” James said. “Rather than exporting the designs as images or having to explain where the file is located in Dropbox.”</p><p>The final secret sauce for wooing the eng team? Tell them about <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/">Figma’s work</a> with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a>. We’ve been pushing the boundaries of browser technology, so you might be surprised how many engineers have already heard of us.</p><p>“A few of them loved Figma already because you guys are using WebAssembly,” James said. “You’ve got the best, most kick-ass web-based app. There’s already kudos there from an engineering point of view.”</p><h3 id="woo-the-designers-with-candy"><a href="#woo-the-designers-with-candy">Woo the designers with candy</a></h3><p>Sometimes, designers can be the hardest group to woo to Figma. Many fear open, transparent design. Others don’t believe Figma’s web-based application can perform just as quickly as a desktop one. Figma has done a lot of work on performance and <a href="https://twitter.com/housseynoufall/status/943013882641207296">in some cases beats its desktop counterparts</a>, but people have to experience it themselves to believe it.</p><p>So, to convince designers to give Figma a shot, tempt them with the candy: The <a href="https://blog.figma.com/introducing-vector-networks-3b877d2b864f">vector network</a>, <a href="https://blog.figma.com/team-libraries-in-figma-409fa5e20f7">team library</a> + <a href="https://blog.figma.com/5-essential-ways-to-use-design-constraints-29fb21cbcf40">constraints</a> functionalities, <a href="https://www.figma.com/downloads/">desktop app</a>, and <a href="https://help.figma.com/import/importing-sketch-files">sketch import tool</a>. James took the time to jump into Figma files with other Buffer designers and demonstrate the power of these features.</p><p>“Our junior designer, Tom, didn’t realise the true power of <a href="https://help.figma.com/import/importing-sketch-files">components</a> and how they can make it easier to work with complex designs,” James said. “After I showed him he was like, ‘Wow, this is amazing.’”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b571e2c82bec37a85175a4f33c97469e78593e8f-1600x1016.png?rect=0,0,1600,1015&amp;w=670&amp;h=425&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b571e2c82bec37a85175a4f33c97469e78593e8f-1600x1016.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b571e2c82bec37a85175a4f33c97469e78593e8f-1600x1016.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b571e2c82bec37a85175a4f33c97469e78593e8f-1600x1016.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b571e2c82bec37a85175a4f33c97469e78593e8f-1600x1016.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b571e2c82bec37a85175a4f33c97469e78593e8f-1600x1016.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Buffer components</figcaption></figure><p>Often, once a designer is excited by the Figma candy, they’ll wind up staying for the Figma carrot — the collaboration functions that make it far easier for them to handoff designs to engineers, or communicate what they’re working on to the leadership team.</p><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2><p>After giving Buffer staff ample time to try different design tools, and helping them discover the best of Figma, James didn’t have much more work to do to convince people to make the switch.

To finalize the decision, he sent out one final memo, summarizing why the company was moving to Figma.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c212b5fb810dfacc1782fd834b98e70185ad0e3f-1600x622.png?rect=0,0,1600,621&amp;w=670&amp;h=260&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c212b5fb810dfacc1782fd834b98e70185ad0e3f-1600x622.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c212b5fb810dfacc1782fd834b98e70185ad0e3f-1600x622.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c212b5fb810dfacc1782fd834b98e70185ad0e3f-1600x622.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c212b5fb810dfacc1782fd834b98e70185ad0e3f-1600x622.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c212b5fb810dfacc1782fd834b98e70185ad0e3f-1600x622.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>James&#39; final memo to Buffer</figcaption></figure><p>In the email James concluded: “The design tool Figma will help us be more open, collaborative and consistent with our designs and help us bridge the gap with design handover for engineers.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How Figma Transformed This Berkeley Design Class</title>

      <description>Academia hasn’t kept up with the head-spinning rise of digital design.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Academia hasn’t kept up with the head-spinning rise of digital design. If students are lucky, their design school or engineering program might offer a few UX or UI classes. Otherwise, aspiring designers are stuck cobbling together fragmented Medium articles and Lynda.com videos for guidance.</p><p>One class at UC Berkeley, <a href="https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1458380">An Introduction to Human Computer Interaction</a> (CS 160), is trying to change that. It teaches computer science majors the tenets of usability, and it’s one of only four digital product design courses at the public school, which has 40,000 students.</p><p>CS 160’s teachers have faced their share of hurdles to make the class effective, but over time they’ve perfected their method. For the past few years, Figma has been <a href="https://blog.figma.com/why-professors-at-stanford-and-berkeley-use-this-tool-to-teach-design-4df495445cd5">key to their process</a> — our collaborative, cloud based application allows students with any type of computer to work together in a design file…for free.</p><h2 id="the-early-years-had-a-lot-of-challenges"><a href="#the-early-years-had-a-lot-of-challenges">The early years had a lot of challenges</a></h2><p>Group projects are a core part of CS 160. Students are paired into 3–4 person teams to create Android apps inspired by the semester’s theme. (Past themes include everything from healthcare to the election.) Then, as each week progresses, students apply the lessons they learned in class to their project.</p><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanahu/">Shana Hu</a>, a former student who took the class and then TA’ed it, said they haven’t been able to keep up with demand. One semester, they even had to double CS 160’s original 100 person cap.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ff4b05d77b4961d685ab4ca30ac5a11b2a4d6e90-1000x664.png?w=670&amp;h=445&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ff4b05d77b4961d685ab4ca30ac5a11b2a4d6e90-1000x664.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ff4b05d77b4961d685ab4ca30ac5a11b2a4d6e90-1000x664.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ff4b05d77b4961d685ab4ca30ac5a11b2a4d6e90-1000x664.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ff4b05d77b4961d685ab4ca30ac5a11b2a4d6e90-1000x664.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Figma designer Rasmus Andersson presents to Berkeley’s CS 160 class</figcaption></figure><p>“There’s a craving to learn how to become a designer in the tech industry,” Shana told us. After assistant teaching CS 160 for two semesters, Shana landed a design job herself at Pinterest.</p><p>When Berkeley first started offering CS 160, its instructors had trouble coordinating the tech needs of such a big group of students. For one thing, people in the class used different types of computers. Some students preferred Linux, others split between Windows and Macs, some didn’t have personal laptops at all.</p><div><blockquote><p>There’s a craving for a way to learn to become a designer in the tech industry.</p></blockquote></div><p>“For those who had computer issues with certain software, we designated computer labs but we never figured out something that worked,” Shana admitted.</p><p>Likewise, the TAs struggled to integrate students without design experience into the process. Adobe tools — one of the few design programs to run on all types of computers — required way too much practice. “There was a steep learning curve,” Shana explained. “We’d spend most of our time teaching Photoshop instead of design.”</p><p>They jury rigged what they could, which meant that in some group projects only students with design training and the right computers did the wireframing and prototyping. The others would help out with user testing or write the actual code.</p><h2 id="students-picked-up-figma-for-an-hour"><a href="#students-picked-up-figma-for-an-hour">Students picked up Figma for an hour</a></h2><p>Shana and the other TAs were convinced there was a better way, and eventually found Figma. Our tool met all their needs.</p><p><em>Figma&#39;s <a href="https://blog.figma.com/why-professors-at-stanford-and-berkeley-use-this-tool-to-teach-design-4df495445cd5">benefits</a> in the classroom:</em></p><ul><li>Free for students</li><li>Works on every type of computer</li><li>Design commenting function lets teachers leave feedback in context</li><li>Simple, easy-to-learn interface</li><li>Teachers can review work progress with version control</li><li>Multiple students can edit the same design file at the same time</li><li>Prototyping is built in for student presentations</li></ul><p>One compsci major, <a href="https://twitter.com/ryankapur?lang=en">Ryan Kapur</a>, said he picked up Figma in an hour despite not having design tool experience. Its ease of use allowed him to focus on the class lessons — like <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">learning Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics</a>.</p><p>“We were able to apply the stuff taught in class right onto our project,” Ryan said. “By doing that we ingrained the concepts in our heads a lot deeper.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/988f75aea6aaa30aed9494ebbdab27841c3d43a0-1000x365.png?rect=1,0,998,365&amp;w=670&amp;h=245&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/988f75aea6aaa30aed9494ebbdab27841c3d43a0-1000x365.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/988f75aea6aaa30aed9494ebbdab27841c3d43a0-1000x365.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/988f75aea6aaa30aed9494ebbdab27841c3d43a0-1000x365.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/988f75aea6aaa30aed9494ebbdab27841c3d43a0-1000x365.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 998w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Final app prototype Ryan’s group designed in Figma</figcaption></figure><p>Each semester was a different theme, and Ryan’s class focused on health care.

They could leave comments for students in context of the design, compared to previous tools, when they’d have to give feedback en masse over email or other applications. Back then, they would just hope students understood what part of the design the feedback was meant for.</p><h2 id="group-projects-became-more-collaborative"><a href="#group-projects-became-more-collaborative">Group projects became more collaborative</a></h2><p>Figma lets multiple people edit a file at the same time, so students could collaborate on designs together, watch each other work, check on how projects progressed, or brainstorm within the file. “The live editing feature came in handy right before project deadlines,” Ryan admitted.</p><p>If teams wanted to work on the design outside of class, they didn’t have to worry about corrupting or saving over a file if several people opened it at once. That gave everyone the opportunity to contribute and participate.</p><p>“The most magical things happen when you’re able to bring two fields together,” Shana said. “That’s what we tried to introduce in this class, with Figma’s help.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Designers are always looking toward the future — in our “build and ship it now” industry we’re programmed to iterate ad finitum. In the end, a designer’s obsession always circles back to one simple question: How can we improve the user’s experience?</p><p>With that in mind, Figma asked 18 designers what UI/UX trends they predict for 2018. December, with its flurry of holiday parties, cheery OOO auto-replies and introspective weather patterns, provided the perfect opportunity to pause and survey the landscape.</p><p>Designers were culled from a few different sources: those who attended last month’s Figma sponsored <a href="https://blog.figma.com/introducing-designsystems-com-8826fd2efd57">design systems dinner</a>, speakers at this year’s <a href="https://www.clarityconf.com/">Clarity Conference</a> and friends of the Figma family. You’ll read through opinions from designers who work anywhere from Facebook to Google to Airbnb. We even crowdsourced Twitter, receiving <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign/status/940285700842201088">61 thoughtful responses</a> that were much appreciated.</p><p>Like a collective hive brain, many designers touched on similar topics, from accessibility and ethical accountability, to collaborative design.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="uAn74XYYpjPK" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75d3a16f44cc7b49e7e380eb09b434c183d3acf6-1400x700.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75d3a16f44cc7b49e7e380eb09b434c183d3acf6-1400x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75d3a16f44cc7b49e7e380eb09b434c183d3acf6-1400x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75d3a16f44cc7b49e7e380eb09b434c183d3acf6-1400x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75d3a16f44cc7b49e7e380eb09b434c183d3acf6-1400x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75d3a16f44cc7b49e7e380eb09b434c183d3acf6-1400x700.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="_1-accessibility-will-be-first-ego-second"><a href="#_1-accessibility-will-be-first-ego-second">1.

      <description>Now that they’ve completed over half a dozen successful sprints, we sat down with Ellen to learn how our cloud-based design platform fits into each part of the process</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Personal style service Stitch Fix made waves in November as the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/11/17/stitchfix-goes-public-marking-the-first-tech-ipo-led-by-a-woman-this-year/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.c65e3cdfcc14">first tech IPO</a> led by a woman in 2017. Since then, its market cap has nearly doubled. The company won the hearts of consumers with an elegant app and website experience that makes receiving (and in some cases returning) a monthly box of clothing fun instead of daunting.</p><p>To adapt to their growing user base and the ever-changing nature of the web, Stitch Fix uses design sprints — like hackathons for design — to troubleshoot challenges. From the get-go, they’ve relied on Figma to stay aligned and on track, according to Stitch Fix Head of Product Design Ellen Beldner.</p><div><blockquote><p>Figma unlocked collaboration across departments, so that everyone could solve the tough problems together.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="step-1-sprinting-in-the-cloud"><a href="#step-1-sprinting-in-the-cloud">Step 1: Sprinting in the Cloud</a></h2><p>Now that they’ve completed over half a dozen successful sprints, we sat down with Ellen to learn how our cloud-based design platform fits into each part of the process.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/756807cc50a009c1ea93a3f0369145f205959bec-1400x800.png?rect=0,0,1399,800&amp;w=670&amp;h=383&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/756807cc50a009c1ea93a3f0369145f205959bec-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/756807cc50a009c1ea93a3f0369145f205959bec-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/756807cc50a009c1ea93a3f0369145f205959bec-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/756807cc50a009c1ea93a3f0369145f205959bec-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/756807cc50a009c1ea93a3f0369145f205959bec-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The best design sprints start with ideation, whiteboarding, and a ton of crumpled up Post-it notes. Stitch Fix designers, engineers, marketers and project managers test out solutions until the perfect one emerges, shining with straightforward simplicity. Then the real fun kicks off: designing a prototype using Figma.</p><p>Because Figma runs in the browser, the team doesn’t waste any time during this transition. Everyone can open a shared file with a simple URL — from the PMs using PCs to the comms designers who are diehard Mac loyalists.</p><p>Ellen explains:</p><div><blockquote><p>“The reason I think Figma makes this terrifically easy is because:<br/>1) You’re not dealing with the back and forth files.<br/>2) Other people don’t need to install any crazy software in order to see what you’re doing.<br/>3) There is one source of truth.<br/>It isn’t just that it replaces Sketch. Figma replaces Sketch, InVision and Zeplin.”</p></blockquote></div><p>With Figma, the design sprint attendees can skip the usual steps — buying, downloading and installing a menagerie of applications — and move straight into prototyping.</p><h2 id="step-2-brainstorming-and-critiquing-in-tandem"><a href="#step-2-brainstorming-and-critiquing-in-tandem">Step 2: Brainstorming and critiquing in tandem</a></h2><p>In this early prototyping stage, design sprint attendees inevitably hit some challenges. Perhaps their oh-so-simple feature idea is far more difficult to execute than they’d expected. In other cases, changing one part of a flow ripples through the rest of the user experience in an unexpected way. To work through these kinds of hiccups on tight deadline, teams need to collaborate quickly and effectively.</p><div><blockquote><p>It isn’t just that it replaces Sketch. Figma replaces Sketch, InVision and Zeplin.</p></blockquote></div><p>Here’s a common design sprint scenario: One person needs immediate feedback on a wireframe, so they ask others for a second opinion.</p><p>Without Figma, people would either need to huddle around one person’s computer, effectively stopping the design process, or export and email the file.</p><p>Stitch Fix avoids all that using Figma’s Multiplayer feature. If anyone on Ellen’s team needs feedback, she scrolls to their trouble spot and immediately rattles off suggestions. She also leaves feedback via Figma’s commenting function, or quickly draws a mock-up in the file to demonstrate her suggestion.</p><p>“There’s no possible way for something like Sketch or Photoshop to do this job,” Ellen explains. “You’re going to have four people working on four different versions of the file and you’re not going to be able to see what people are doing.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/662ea8dc6a8a19ac0aae1c0e40bc25650d44b783-1400x800.png?rect=0,0,1399,800&amp;w=670&amp;h=383&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/662ea8dc6a8a19ac0aae1c0e40bc25650d44b783-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/662ea8dc6a8a19ac0aae1c0e40bc25650d44b783-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/662ea8dc6a8a19ac0aae1c0e40bc25650d44b783-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/662ea8dc6a8a19ac0aae1c0e40bc25650d44b783-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/662ea8dc6a8a19ac0aae1c0e40bc25650d44b783-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Ellen says this makes detailed feedback much easier, erasing the need to schedule meetings for walk-throughs. During one particularly hairy sprint, a designer showed her eight or nine ideas. Ellen went through each one, left comments, and sketched a few mockups to illustrate her points. The designer was then free to pop back into that same URL to study the critique whenever she wanted.</p><p>“Everyone is able to edit the same source of truth in the same file at the same time, and that lets us work so much more quickly and coherently,” she tells us. “When we are creating prototypes of a higher fidelity, Figma makes it much easier for everyone to stay aligned.”</p><p>In short? Figma shuts down potential project management chaos before it even begins.</p><p>Time is of the essence during a sprint. Teams have zilch wiggle room for busy work, like replicating the same icon over and over in every design frame. This is where Figma’s shared components — reusable instances of UI elements — come into play.</p><div><blockquote><p>Everyone is able to edit the same source of truth, and that lets us work so much more quickly and coherently.</p></blockquote></div><p>During one sprint Ellen’s team prototyped a card-based design system. It was a serious challenge because it meant testing which combination of cards would be most effective for certain users. To do this, her team took advantage of Figma’s <a href="https://blog.figma.com/components-in-figma-e7e80fcf6fd2">shared components feature</a>.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4540a9fad7ba281efdd68a3f26110b255091b4a3-1400x800.png?rect=0,0,1399,800&amp;w=670&amp;h=383&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4540a9fad7ba281efdd68a3f26110b255091b4a3-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4540a9fad7ba281efdd68a3f26110b255091b4a3-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4540a9fad7ba281efdd68a3f26110b255091b4a3-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4540a9fad7ba281efdd68a3f26110b255091b4a3-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4540a9fad7ba281efdd68a3f26110b255091b4a3-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>When they changed the master component all of its instances would also change, saving them a ton of time on useless busywork. Not only that, but designers could drop in instances as Ellen forged ahead to the navigation tab. This gave everyone more time to gnaw over high-level problems.</p><p>“I want my team to spend time thinking about high level UX problems, rather than mindlessly repeating busy work,” Ellen says. “Figma helps them do that.”</p><h2 id="step-4-other-departments-jump-in-to-wrap-up"><a href="#step-4-other-departments-jump-in-to-wrap-up">Step 4: Other departments jump in to wrap up</a></h2><p>A design sprint is a hybrid beast of multiple departments, not just designers refining the same prototype ad nauseum. Marketing, engineering and design sweat side by side in the sprint trenches.</p><p>Figma runs in the browser (think: Google Docs of design), and everyone can jump in the file at the same time. As a result, the design team works in parallel instead of sequentially. To do their part of the job, developers and copy whizzes don’t have to wait for designers to finish wireframing.</p><p>“I come from a history of collaborative work cultures, something that’s very important for me to recreate here at Stitch Fix,” Ellen tells us. “I love the way Figma makes it easy for people to pull up what another designer is doing and make a comment.”</p><p>The marketing team especially benefits from Figma, a surprising revelation considering they don’t normally work with design tools.</p><p>“I don’t know if you’ve had this experience, but working inside of a design tool is usually a nightmare for copywriters,” Ellen says. “They have to write and edit copy strings for every single element. Trying to do that in a way that is efficient is crazy.”</p><div><blockquote><p>Working inside of a design tool is usually a nightmare for copywriters.</p></blockquote></div><p>Now the copy team pops in during the later stages, spritz a headline here and some microcopy there before engineering builds everything out. They can test out what text length displays best and experiment accordingly.</p><p>“When we used Sketch in previous sprints it was difficult because we had to constantly update each other,” she explains. “Grabbing the text from marketing meant opening up Google Docs and copy pasting.”</p><h2 id="stitch-fix-s-stamp-of-approval"><a href="#stitch-fix-s-stamp-of-approval">Stitch Fix’s stamp of approval</a></h2><p>“Figma unlocked collaboration across departments, so that everyone could solve the tough problems together,” Ellen concludes. “I highly recommend it for accelerating design sprints to a higher level.”</p><p><em>Have you or your company used Figma during a design sprint?

      <description>“Clients love it, we love it.” — Unfold agency</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Design agencies work with an endless cast of characters: developers, marketers, designers, sales folk, and project managers galore, spanning both the agency’s own staff and the teams of all their clients.</p><p>Collaboration challenges compound in environments like this. There are so many people involved, all using different computers and operating systems, with a rainbow array of software paid for (or none at all). Sharing up-to-date designs and communicating about them is nigh impossible.</p><p>Unfold, a <a href="https://www.unfold.co/">10-person design agency in Florida</a> that works with clients like Squarespace and PayPal, knows these struggles all too well. “We found ourselves overwriting each other’s files, or having conflicting file issues when we had multiple versions open,” founder <a href="https://twitter.com/lobanovskiy">Eddie Lobanovskiy</a> remembered. “That was really frustrating.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6e4a0bc6117fae2f09efb3497a02e9d050f64e85-1000x529.png?rect=0,0,1000,528&amp;w=670&amp;h=354&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6e4a0bc6117fae2f09efb3497a02e9d050f64e85-1000x529.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6e4a0bc6117fae2f09efb3497a02e9d050f64e85-1000x529.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6e4a0bc6117fae2f09efb3497a02e9d050f64e85-1000x529.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6e4a0bc6117fae2f09efb3497a02e9d050f64e85-1000x529.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Illustrations made by Eddie Lobanovskiy in Figma</figcaption></figure><p>To solve these challenges, they spent years hacking together an avalanche of plug-ins for simple tasks. Eventually, Lobanovskiy got fed up, went searching for an alternative, and found Figma, an all-in-one design, prototyping, and developer handoff tool. Because it runs in the cloud, teams can share always up-to-date designs, collect comments, and give file attributes to engineers, simply by sending a URL. Any person with any type of computer can access the designs.</p><p>“We absolutely fell in love,” Lobanovskiy remembered. “It immediately removed this hassle of versioning, collaboration and feedback. It frees up a ton of time, and time is obviously money.” He estimates Figma saves Unfold at least 30% of time spent on communication alone.</p><p>(Recognize Unfold’s name? They’re also known for <a href="https://www.grabient.com/">Grabient</a>, a tool that went <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/grabient">a little viral</a> on Product Hunt. It allows designers to modify and grab gradients.)</p><h2 id="everything-you-do-lives-in-one-place"><a href="#everything-you-do-lives-in-one-place">Everything you do lives in one place</a></h2><p>Once the team was convinced Figma was the right choice for them, they then had to persuade clients to make the move. Most of Unfold’s companies had never heard of Figma, but Lobanovskiy said that wasn’t a problem. “It’s an easy sell when we tell them it’s a platform where everything we do lives in one place,” Lobanovskiy told us.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4c88068fbbb3cbcd82b347124e3df04a1b2204c-1000x664.png?w=670&amp;h=445&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4c88068fbbb3cbcd82b347124e3df04a1b2204c-1000x664.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4c88068fbbb3cbcd82b347124e3df04a1b2204c-1000x664.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4c88068fbbb3cbcd82b347124e3df04a1b2204c-1000x664.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a4c88068fbbb3cbcd82b347124e3df04a1b2204c-1000x664.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Unfold’s project structure for one of their clients</figcaption></figure><p>To transition some of their original clients’ projects, the Unfold team used Figma’s Sketch importer feature, which lets you bring Sketch design files right into Figma. For the new clients, the team took advantage of Figma’s multiplayer functionality to brainstorm. Everyone jumped in a file and started sketching out ideas together.</p><div><blockquote><p>It frees up a ton of time, and time is obviously money.</p></blockquote></div><p>“It’s amazing to see everyone working at the same time and getting those thoughts out super rapidly,” Lobanovskiy said. “Clients love it, we love it.” It’s not something the team could do before they found Figma, because there was no design program that would let everyone collaborate together in the same document.</p><p>After initial brainstorms, the Unfold designers then fill out mood boards or templates, complete with color palettes, font options and visual inspiration. In the past, they’d save images locally on their computers and then manually upload them to prototyping tools.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/931aa80007d462f8d358397e47aa4a2dfc41aba5-1000x629.png?rect=0,0,1000,628&amp;w=670&amp;h=421&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/931aa80007d462f8d358397e47aa4a2dfc41aba5-1000x629.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/931aa80007d462f8d358397e47aa4a2dfc41aba5-1000x629.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/931aa80007d462f8d358397e47aa4a2dfc41aba5-1000x629.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/931aa80007d462f8d358397e47aa4a2dfc41aba5-1000x629.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>One of Unfold’s mood boards for a project</figcaption></figure><p>“Creating mood boards in Figma is a lot faster because you can drag and drop files straight from the web into your document,” Lobanovskiy said. “It’s instant — there’s no wait time for anything, you just keep moving forward.”</p><p>When the Unfold team builds out higher fidelity designs in Figma, everyone can access the latest version at the same URL. There’s no need for anyone to export or upload the file, and clients can leave their thoughts whenever they like using Figma’s commenting tool. Comments in Figma are pinned to the design frame they refer to, so feedback appears in context instead of scattered in places like Slack or email.</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s an easy sell when we tell them it’s a platform where everything we do lives in one place.</p></blockquote></div><h2 id="conquering-the-doom-of-developer-handoff"><a href="#conquering-the-doom-of-developer-handoff">Conquering the doom of developer handoff</a></h2><p>Unfold’s least favorite part of the process in the past? Developer handoff. “Before Figma, we had clients with developers who weren’t on Macs, so that would always be a bad conversation,” Lobanovskiy remembered. “We’d have to try to convince them to do things they didn’t want to do, like buy subscriptions to other tools.”</p><p>To avoid this, they’d wind up converting design files to PSDs by running them through Illustrator, which would inevitably mess up the layers. “The whole process was insane,” Lobanovskiy said. “We’d have to introduce them to ten new things. Versus now, where we say ‘Hey we’re just on Figma.’”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/65df8b97707498227e3898d336844a5ee5d069f6-800x460.png?w=670&amp;h=385&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/65df8b97707498227e3898d336844a5ee5d069f6-800x460.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/65df8b97707498227e3898d336844a5ee5d069f6-800x460.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/65df8b97707498227e3898d336844a5ee5d069f6-800x460.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/65df8b97707498227e3898d336844a5ee5d069f6-800x460.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Unfold founder Eddie Lobanovskiy working on a project in Figma</figcaption></figure><p>Figma’s built in code mode allows developers to export assets and grab CSS, Android and iOS data. Those assets are always up to date with the latest design — no syncing necessary — because it’s all part of Figma’s cloud-based platform. And developers can do all that with view only access — meaning Unfold’s clients don’t have to pay for their use of Figma. “It’s a huge plus that it’s cross platform, you don’t have to worry about telling people, ‘You’re not on Mac so you can’t open the files,’” Lobanovskiy said. “We get a lot of compliments.”</p><h2 id="more-time-more-clients"><a href="#more-time-more-clients">More time, more clients</a></h2><p>Ultimately, Figma simplified Unfold’s process and helped the agency finish projects faster, according to Lobanovskiy. It also minimized the number of challenges the team faced along the way. “Even if it didn’t save time it’s just so pleasant to use because it flows,” Lobanovskiy said. “It feels like we can take on more work with Figma.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Advanced Project Permissions for design systems</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/advanced-project-permissions-for-design-systems/</link>
      <description>With increasing intensity, design and product teams are mulling over the what’s and the how’s of design systems.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With increasing intensity, design and product teams are mulling over the what’s and the how’s of design systems. At <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, we’re passionate about empowering the builders and maintainers of those systems. We’ve logged countless hours studying how design systems affect a company’s workflow while listening to users’ war stories. Next, we knuckled down.</p><p>Launching <a href="https://blog.figma.com/team-library-1-0-d1427092323a">Team Library</a> was our first major hurdle; we needed to ensure components could be easily shared between files and teams. Then, yesterday, we launched <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/">DesignSystems.com</a>, a learning resource for the design community to discuss design systems.</p><p>But you know us, we’re nowhere near finished. We realized teams building and maintaining design systems must control their projects’ privacy and accessibility. Those designers tasked with building the design system often want to privately test them before deploying to the entire team. After the design system is created, the maintainers may need to protect their work from accidental edits by those following the design system’s guidelines.</p><p>To address those points, we’re very excited to announce <a href="https://help.figma.com/managing-your-account/permissions">Advanced Project Permissions</a>. This crucial functionality enables two new permission options for paying teams: view-only and invite-only. We believe this is an essential step to more easily architecting robust design systems.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/923c389da19c5c6256a2baafe9453d9d3c731abd-944x418.png?rect=1,0,943,418&amp;w=670&amp;h=297&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/923c389da19c5c6256a2baafe9453d9d3c731abd-944x418.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/923c389da19c5c6256a2baafe9453d9d3c731abd-944x418.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/923c389da19c5c6256a2baafe9453d9d3c731abd-944x418.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/923c389da19c5c6256a2baafe9453d9d3c731abd-944x418.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 943w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>So, what will this new functionality look like in practice? First, you’ll need to subscribe as an editor within a <a href="https://www.figma.com/pricing/">Professional Team</a> at Figma. Then, when creating a new project, you’ll see a drop down menu granting you three options: “Everyone at [team name] can edit,” “Everyone at [team name] can view” and “Invite-only — let me choose who has access.”</p><p>If you’d like to switch your team’s default access from an existing project, simply click on the Share button and toggle between permissions.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cc5e94831bbc833ee909edcb4160c6d1d4be0c27-926x446.png?rect=0,0,925,446&amp;w=670&amp;h=323&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cc5e94831bbc833ee909edcb4160c6d1d4be0c27-926x446.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cc5e94831bbc833ee909edcb4160c6d1d4be0c27-926x446.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cc5e94831bbc833ee909edcb4160c6d1d4be0c27-926x446.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cc5e94831bbc833ee909edcb4160c6d1d4be0c27-926x446.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 925w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Before today, editors on Figma teams could view and edit <em>all</em> projects. Now Private Project Permissions will act as a buffer between the design system “maintainers” and “viewers,” preventing well-intentioned team members with “viewing” access from accidentally making changes to the “maintainer’s” meticulous work.</p><p>When we tried this out at Figma, we found it helped our workflow tremendously. However, depending on the ratio of “maintainers” to “viewers,” this could mean individuals on larger teams might have fewer opportunities to make changes. We’re constantly looking to improve workflows around design systems. As part of that, we’re also exploring concepts like pull requests. Similar to how an engineer can ask a code owner to make a change, we’re trying to figure out ways to facilitate dialogue between design system maintainers and individual designers who have suggestions around ways to improve the overall system.</p><p>If you have ideas for how we can continue to improve design system workflows in Figma, please reach out to us via <a href="https://twitter.com/figmadesign">Twitter</a> / <a href="https://spectrum.chat/figma">Spectrum</a> or leave a comment! We believe design systems represent the future of our industry, and we would love your help on making Figma the best tool for the job.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Just months after our public launch in 2016, we introduced Figma’s team library feature to help companies share libraries of components across files and teams.</p><p>In our complex multi-screen world, designers need tools to scale their process quickly. Tech companies are competing on the strength of their user experience and as their design headcount increases, they face issues of consistency, communication and execution.</p><p>As a result, there has been a recent uptick in the interest <a href="https://blog.figma.com/this-twitter-storm-shows-design-systems-are-still-up-for-debate-fb02a64c8fca">around design systems</a> — even though they’re not a new concept. We have been hearing a ton of questions from our community: Should design components be tied to code? Do companies need to hire teams to build these systems? How do you get a design system off the ground? Will design systems replace designers?</p><h2 id="what-do-you-want-to-know-about-design-systems"><a href="#what-do-you-want-to-know-about-design-systems">What do you want to know about design systems?</a></h2><p>Today, we’re excited to introduce <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/">DesignSystems.com</a>, which will become a hub for the broader design community to learn about and engage in discussion around the craft of building design systems.</p><p>As designers, we like to wrap up months upon months of blood, sweat and tears into a shiny Medium post talking about how great our work is. However, this isn’t always helpful for others. By hiding the complexity of our process we discourage our peers when they hit everyday roadblocks instead of inspiring them to power through.</p><p><a href="https://www.designsystems.com/">DesignSystems.com</a> will tackle the hard topics head on. We’ll share the messy war stories, hard earned lessons and best practices that everyone can benefit from. We’ll also explore the cultural and economic impact of design systems.</p><p>Do you have stories to share about creating a design system? We want to hear about your successes, failures and burning questions. Go to <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/">DesignSystems.com</a> and share with us.</p><h2 id="moving-the-conversation-offline"><a href="#moving-the-conversation-offline">Moving the conversation offline</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87ef73e18eae6446bae7431f98b04d5484c69052-1600x1247.jpg?w=670&amp;h=522&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87ef73e18eae6446bae7431f98b04d5484c69052-1600x1247.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87ef73e18eae6446bae7431f98b04d5484c69052-1600x1247.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87ef73e18eae6446bae7431f98b04d5484c69052-1600x1247.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87ef73e18eae6446bae7431f98b04d5484c69052-1600x1247.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/87ef73e18eae6446bae7431f98b04d5484c69052-1600x1247.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Last Night’s Design System Dinner in San Francisco</figcaption></figure><p> <br/> A huge part of implementing a design system is working through the social dynamics of your organization. Some of the most important stories are too sensitive to tell in a public forum. We want to encourage you to dive into these gritty details face to face with other designers in your community.</p><p>At Figma, we believe Design Systems represent the future of our industry, so we’re going to be sponsoring a series of Design Systems dinners. We held our first dinner last night in San Francisco with an awesome group of people. We debated late into the night about how design systems change the organizations that create them.</p><p>Given that Figma’s user base (and the design community in general) is global in nature, we want to invite designers from around the world to partner with us in future events.</p><p>We’ll be choosing select hosts / groups to sponsor for these dinners. If you would like to take part, let us know! Tell us about yourself and your interest in design systems at <a href="https://www.designsystems.com/">DesignSystems.com</a>.</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>5 international cities with up-and-coming UI/UX design communities</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/five-international-cities-with-up-and-coming-ui-ux-design-communities/</link>
      <description>We set out to uncover UI/UX design communities across the globe</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Silicon Valley suffers from tech tunnel vision. Despite product design communities popping up all over the world, our industry leans towards myopic. It’s easy to focus solely on the sitcom-worthy techie paradise where brightly hued bicycles are strewn across grassy knolls and Kombucha is chugged vigorously.</p><p>In actuality, UI/UX design communities across the globe are stronger than ever. This is partly due to the rising tide of design conferences, meet-ups and remote work, but also thanks to educational programs cropping up and actively feeding the next generation of baby designers.</p><p>So, we set out to uncover a few of these up-and-coming design epicenters. We poked into a UX conference in a Baltic capital known for its old world charm, discovered a South American innovation studio partnering with IDEO and dove deep into a flourishing design internship in West Africa. Our methodology was like adventure itself, full of surprising twists and revelations with hours spent scouring Meetup.com and combing through <a href="https://en.unesco.org/creative-cities/home">UNESCO approved Creative Cities</a>.</p><p>Maybe you’re a recent college grad thirsting for a change in scenery, a seasoned digital nomad seeking a global design community or perhaps you’re a remote freelancer with more freedom than you know what to do with. Whatever the motivation, these faraway locales promise the opportunity to meet designers who are just as passionate about the granularities of UI/UX as you. Who knows, maybe good design is the universal language we can all tap into.</p><h2 id="s-o-paulo-brazil"><a href="#s-o-paulo-brazil">São Paulo, Brazil</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4cfb86dd534306b7eb1d1a9f488fe5ea5f9aaf9-1562x980.png?rect=0,0,1562,979&amp;w=670&amp;h=420&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4cfb86dd534306b7eb1d1a9f488fe5ea5f9aaf9-1562x980.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4cfb86dd534306b7eb1d1a9f488fe5ea5f9aaf9-1562x980.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4cfb86dd534306b7eb1d1a9f488fe5ea5f9aaf9-1562x980.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4cfb86dd534306b7eb1d1a9f488fe5ea5f9aaf9-1562x980.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d4cfb86dd534306b7eb1d1a9f488fe5ea5f9aaf9-1562x980.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>São Paulo is a sprawling metropolis with a highly educated middle class and, surprisingly, the largest population of Japanese found outside of Japan. Its diversity doesn’t stop at ethnicity; the city also boasts the largest openly LGBTQ community in all of Latin America. This sort of forward-thinking sensibility is a perfect breeding ground for tech and design nerds. <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1628289/brazil-designs-next-superpower">Fast Company</a> waxed poetic about the city’s potential back in 2010, citing its perfect weather, isolation and craft-based culture as catalysts: “I’m confident we’ll have a new design superpower in our midst very soon.”</p><p>Seven years later and their prediction ring true.

This quickly changed when China dubbed it a Special Economic Zone in the 80’s, investing resources as an experiment of centralized capitalism. The city grew to 11 million in the span of only 37 years and has since morphed into China’s supreme design hub.</p><p>“When you think of design, think of digital design and then think of the impact of digitisation in our daily lives, that is Shenzhen,” Luisa Mengoni, head of London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, told <a href="https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/1992730/what-hong-kong-doing-narrow-design-gap-shenzhen">Post Magazine.</a></p><p>In 2017 it easily overshadows nearby Hong Kong in creativity, with 6,000 design firms employing 100,000 people. It’s a creative hotspot for designers working in all mediums (and it’s recognized by UNESCO as an official Cultural Center). According to the experts, the technology industry in Shenzhen will play an even more vibrant role in the next two decades: <em>“Shenzhen is going to emerge as the undisputed leader of innovation and technology, rather like Silicon Valley is now,”</em> Neo Bie, founder of design brand Stylepie, told <a href="https://www.wallpaper.com/design/how-shenzhen-is-becoming-the-creative-capital-of-china">Wallpaper</a>.</p><h2 id="riga-latvia"><a href="#riga-latvia">Riga, Latvia</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8091ecc99c54ac4d4e1ce3e31cf15bd5aec75dff-1462x968.png?rect=1,0,1461,968&amp;w=670&amp;h=444&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8091ecc99c54ac4d4e1ce3e31cf15bd5aec75dff-1462x968.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8091ecc99c54ac4d4e1ce3e31cf15bd5aec75dff-1462x968.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8091ecc99c54ac4d4e1ce3e31cf15bd5aec75dff-1462x968.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8091ecc99c54ac4d4e1ce3e31cf15bd5aec75dff-1462x968.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8091ecc99c54ac4d4e1ce3e31cf15bd5aec75dff-1462x968.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Riga, the largest of the Baltic cities, is going through an exciting transition period.

Despite the city’s weak infrastructure and poor economic reputation, it teems with potential.</p><p>Community-driven organizations are largely to thank. For instance, <a href="https://lagos.design/">The Design Institute</a> in Lagos organizes workshops, hackathons and industry events for designers while welcoming all creative mediums, even filmmakers and chefs. Their next big event scheduled is <a href="https://lagos.design/lagos-design-expo/">LDX</a>, a design hackathon with the theme “The Millennial Consumer.” It’s a week-long affair led by heavyweight thought leaders in the design space such as Perry Klebahn of <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/">d.school Stanford</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda">John Maeda</a> of Automattic.

      <title>Introducing: Figma Pages</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figma-pages/</link>
      <description>Now you can divide your brainstorms, iterations, and final assets into separate, accessible documents without ever leaving the file.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The design process starts with messy brainstorms and infinite possibility, and somehow ends with finished products (when all goes well).</p><p>Each stage of the workflow — from wireframing to pixel pushing — requires a different approach and mindset. So it’s not surprising that designers prefer to put each step’s sketches in separate documents, versus having them all jumbled together. That way, they can go creatively buck wild in the beginning, but leave all the chaos behind when it’s time to polish the ultimate product.</p><p>To meet this need, we’re introducing <strong>Figma Pages</strong> — an extra layer of organizational control. Now you can divide your brainstorms, iterations, and final assets into separate, accessible documents without ever leaving the file. We hope this will make it easier for you to categorize and navigate elements of your design.</p><p>In the left hand panel of your design file you’ll see the option to add, switch or delete Pages. This Pages menu will collapse as soon as the designer is done manipulating Pages — although you’ll have the option to lock it open if you control click the panel. When you use our <a href="https://help.figma.com/import/importing-sketch-files">Sketch import feature</a>, your pages and symbols will import into Figma the same way you organized them in Sketch.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="here-are-some-examples-of-how-you-could-use-pages"><a href="#here-are-some-examples-of-how-you-could-use-pages">Here are some examples of how you could use Pages:</a></h3><ul><li>If you like to keep your work stages separate, you can do messy brainstorming on one Page, wireframing on another, and put the finished product on a third</li><li>If you’re designing a mobile app, you can put the iOS frames on one Page and the Android frames on another</li><li>If you’re building a complex interface, you can categorize certain elements, like shared components or icons, on separate Pages</li><li>If you like to curate your file thumbnails in your browser for easy skimming, you can change which Page is used by placing it first in the left hand panel of the file</li><li>If you need to create multiple prototypes per file, you can put each prototype on an individual Page</li></ul><p><strong>Privacy note:</strong> If you share a Page with someone, they’ll be able to see the rest of the file the Page is located in.</p><div><blockquote><p>Tip: To move a component between Pages, right click it and select ‘Move to Page’</p></blockquote></div><p>There’s no limit to the number of Pages you can create, so riff to your heart’s content. The only thing we’d caution you against: Don’t create extra Pages as a form of version control. Figma has a robust version control system already (see how to <a href="https://help.figma.com/version-history/version-history">access it here</a>). If you’re duplicating giant design files again and again on many Pages, it could impact your performance.</p><p>Look for the small and subtle changes throughout the app and please let us know what you think! We’ll continue to develop it with guidance from our users.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>10 UI/UX Design Internships Figma Users Swear By</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/ten-ui-ux-design-internships-figma-users-swear-by/</link>
      <description>Students&#39; stories and what they built in Figma.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Not all internships are created equal, especially in tech. To save you time sifting through thousands of possibilities, we crowdsourced Figma users on Twitter for their most rewarding UI/UX internship experiences. The diverse results impressed us. More than a few Silicon Valley heavyweights made the cut, such as Facebook and Palantir, but several on the list came from unexpected places — like Canada’s e-commerce giant Shopify and Nigeria’s remote paid internship Hotels.ng.</p><p>So, what attributes made these internships so memorable? Some Figma users named the catered lunches (and dinners and breakfasts <em>and</em> snack wall), others the generous compensation. But most people who responded on Twitter cared far more about the meat and bones of an internship — whether a company helped them practice the craft, run real user tests, and learn from their mistakes with the guidance of more seasoned professionals.</p><p>For example, a few designers loved Shopify’s focus on mentorship for the interns. The company assigns a staff member to each and every design newbie, ensuring no one falls through the cracks. Spotify does the same, with a designated mentor/manager advising throughout the entire program.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, the collaborative design platform, we want to make design accessible for anyone to learn. That’s why we are and forever will be (pinky-promise!) completely free for students.</p><p>Racking up quality internships is key while cruising along on student loans. During this nascent phase of your design career, here are a few internship programs worthy — and deserving — of your undivided attention, even if the company foosball table calls.</p><p>Click on each heading for more information pertinent to the company’s program. Happy internship hunting!</p><h2 id="shopify"><a href="#shopify">Shopify</a></h2><p>Shopify places interns in cross-department teams so they’ll learn how to effectively communicate and collaborate with all team members from conception to execution. Design interns work on deployable projects, such as <a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/75915589-team-communication-and-collaboration-comes-to-shopify">Timeline</a>, and a staggering 80% of interns either return to Shopify or go full-time.</p><h2 id="hotels-ng"><a href="#hotels-ng">Hotels.ng</a></h2><p>Out of the 21 responses we received, 14 were about Hotels.ng, Nigeria’s leading hotel booking site. By partnering with the Akwa Ibom State government, they’ve instituted a remote paid internship for local residents to learn UI/UX design. It works like this: Anyone can apply, but interns are cut from the program if they don’t successfully complete tasks. The interns who last the full three-months are often snatched up for full-time positions either by Hotels.ng or other local businesses.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#"></a></h2><p>We’d be remiss not to include Facebook. Here interns receive an astonishingly high monthly stipend, reportedly $5,600 per month on average, and are treated with the same respect and responsibility as a full-time employee. A former FB intern told <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-really-like-to-be-a-facebook-intern-2015-5">Business Insider</a> that the social media giant is like a “college campus on steroids.”</p><h2 id=""><a href="#"></a></h2><p>At Spotify, you’re not just another employee — you’re dubbed a band member. The ten-week long internship with the Goliath of music streaming services places you in tight-knit squads with the constraints of two-week long sprints.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@yukiasa/whats-it-like-to-intern-at-spotify-as-a-product-designer-38e250b3e0a9">Yuki Asakura’s Medium post</a> on what it’s like to be a product design intern at Spotify confirms they’re “design-centric” and “visual craft is a prerequisite.” And one Glassdoor review bemoaned they were “gaining weight from all the free food.”</p><h2 id=""><a href="#"></a></h2><p>Futureforce, Salesforce’s cutely named internship program, is where you’re sure to work on meaningful projects, according to former Salesforce intern <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-like-interning-salesforce-bailey-braunecker/">Bailey Brauneker</a>. Social events outside of work connect interns with executives, as well as the occasional baseball game. Each intern receives up to seven days of VTO (Volunteer Time Off) and one anonymous reviewer on Glassdoor said, “it’s a really good company to learn design systems.”</p><h2 id=""><a href="#"></a></h2><p>Uberites swim in full health benefits, unlimited vacation days, Uber credits and an intense yet rewarding work culture.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@aaronzlewis/here-s-what-i-learned-as-an-intern-at-uber-e3a6060c7f6e">Aaron Z. Lewis</a> on being a product design intern at Uber: “I was consistently surprised by how much access I had to the higher-ups at Uber. But the even crazier thing was that they listened to what I, a 20-year-old intern, had to say.”</p><h2 id=""><a href="#"></a></h2><p>Dubbed the tempestuous sounding “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0GAn8kw_SQ">Maelstrom</a>,” IBM’s design internship program in Austin leads about 15 young designers along four unique tracks: design research, visual design, UX design and front-end dev.</p><p>Maelstrom’s program lead, Devin O’Bryan, swears its success stems from an emphasis on <a href="https://www.ibm.com/design/blog-page.shtml?a-descent-into-the-maelstrom">emotional intelligence</a>.</p><h2 id=""><a href="#"></a></h2><p>Glassdoor crowned Airbnb as the #1 company to work at in 2016, no easy feat for a company only a hair over a decade old. The emphasis on design is everywhere, from their gorgeous SF office to the two co-founders who originally hail as designers themselves.</p><p>Known for being progressive, innovative and close-knit, Airbnb appropriately offers its interns travel credits. One Glassdoor reviewer raved, “Airbnb spoils you will all of its perks, making it difficult to work anywhere else after!”</p><h2 id=""><a href="#"></a></h2><p>At Square, interns have wiggle room to explore a wide-range of problems dependent on their changing interests. The company is also known for its work in leveling off the gender disparity still so prevalent in tech.</p><p>Louie Mantia remarked on Quora that his experience at Square “was more than just being a UI designer, it was being an artist at times.”</p><p>Palantir<br/>Palantir, the private company working on counter-terrorism with the federal government via big data analysis, lets product design interns focus on problem-solving rather than on “reinvent[ing] the button stylesheet,” according to former Palantir intern Hayden Bleasel. Instead, their open-source style guide <a href="https://blueprintjs.com/">Blueprint</a> gives designers more time to, as Bleasel puts it, “expose financial fraud, eliminate slavery, coordinate disaster relief or discover new medicines. It’s unreal.”</p><h2 id="on-the-hunt-for-your-dream-job"><a href="#on-the-hunt-for-your-dream-job">On the hunt for your dream job?</a></h2><p>We’re hiring up a storm!

Your Figma design can now be viewed in Zeplin.</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e378c934159e110b94323d3847c8c438d0902a0-828x852.png?rect=0,0,828,851&amp;w=670&amp;h=689&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e378c934159e110b94323d3847c8c438d0902a0-828x852.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e378c934159e110b94323d3847c8c438d0902a0-828x852.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e378c934159e110b94323d3847c8c438d0902a0-828x852.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1e378c934159e110b94323d3847c8c438d0902a0-828x852.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 828w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>As the product design space goes through an unprecedented eruption of innovation 🌋, integrations like this help teams work together in smoother, more efficient ways.

      <title>Why Professors at Stanford and UC Berkeley Use Figma to Teach Design</title>

      <description>If you’re a TA or professor, Figma will empower you to teach design principles, instead of spending all your time training students on the design tool. Here’s how.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Interface design may be taking over Silicon Valley, but it’s still far outside the mainstream curriculum on college campuses. The few courses on the subject are squeezed between majors, as interdisciplinary one-offs.</p><p>As a result, the professors who teach them face an uphill battle. They cover loads of technical concepts, in a limited amount of time, with design tools that take a Ph.D. to learn.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.figma.com/">collaborative design company Figma</a>, we believe design should be accessible to anyone who wants to learn, and we’ve built our product around that mission. We’re free for students, run on any type of computer, and CRAZY easy to use. People pick it up and create designs in minutes. Just ask professors at Berkeley and Stanford, who use Figma to teach <a href="https://bcourses.berkeley.edu/courses/1458380">CS 160</a> (Introduction to Human Computer Interaction) and <a href="https://dschool.stanford.edu/classes/visual-design-fundamentals">DESINST 270</a> (Visual Design Fundamentals).</p><p>If you’re a TA or professor, Figma will empower you to teach design principles, instead of spending all your time training students on the design tool.

Are you shepherding a class of PC owners? No problem. Are your programming students hooked on Linux? Not an issue. Even Chromebooks, the most affordable of the bunch, run Figma. Students who don’t own personal computers can finish assignments wherever, because Figma works anywhere there’s web access.

Students then have more opportunities to incorporate feedback and iterate by removing the constraint of in-person meetings. If you’re curious how their design evolved (or who did the most work in the case of a group project) you can check out revision history to quickly get up to speed on the answers to these questions.</p><h3 id="_7-students-can-work-in-the-same-file-at-the-same"><a href="#_7-students-can-work-in-the-same-file-at-the-same">7.

Figma’s prototyping mode will make it easy for them to create an interactive presentation. They can turn different elements — like a home button — into a hotspot, so when those elements are clicked they take the viewer to the appropriate next screen. It’s intuitive to create (and critique!) the prototype because you can see an overview of the full flow. If your students want to run user tests on mobile phones, they can open the file <a href="https://blog.figma.com/introducing-figma-mirror-for-android-e7a91df24566">in our Android or iPhone Mirror app to do just that.</a></p><h3 id="_10-figma-works-for-online-lessons"><a href="#_10-figma-works-for-online-lessons">10.

All of Figma’s functionality — from sharing design files with a link to our commenting functionality — will make it way easier to teach. Our observation mode allows you to click a user’s avatar in a file and follow along with their design activity. That means that you can sit in Paris and watch a student work in real-time in Albuquerque, offering suggestions on their process without ever meeting them face to face.</p><p>We hope this has been helpful, and we’ve piqued your interest enough to try Figma in the classroom.

      <title>How to throw a design-friendly hackathon</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-to-throw-a-design-friendly-hackathon/</link>
      <description>Since time immemorial, hoodie clad programmers have dominated hackathons.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since time immemorial, hoodie clad programmers have dominated hackathons. The word “hackathon” first surfaced in 1999, at a bug bashing party for an operating system and then at a Sun conference for PalmPilot engineers. These dev-heavy events paved the road for the hackathons that came after, solidifying them as the coder’s domain.</p><p>But it’s been a few decades since 1999 and times have changed. Coding isn’t the sole competitive advantage it once was for tech companies, and design has become a key differentiator for products.</p><p>Likewise, the isolated reign of the hackathon-engineer is coming to a close. As design grows in importance to Silicon Valley, college hackathon organizers are looking for new ways to bring UX/UI tracks into their events. They want to give aspiring designers and engineers the chance to work together — the way they would in an actual career setting.</p><p>If you want more designers at your hackathon and don’t know where to start, you’re in the right place. Schools often ask Figma for advice on this topic since we’re a collaborative design company, so we gathered pro tips from an organization we really admire: Hack@Brown.</p><p>Hack@Brown is the major annual hackathon hosted by Brown University, with upwards of 500 participants. To draw in the artistic crowd, they experimented with new tactics for years and by 2017, ⅕ of all their attendees were designers. You can read more about their story here, and learn from their hard-earned lessons below:</p><h2 id="step-1-find-designers"><a href="#step-1-find-designers">Step 1 — Find designers</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7495723f38cec4735ef5d9588662f358597f500f-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;h=406&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7495723f38cec4735ef5d9588662f358597f500f-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7495723f38cec4735ef5d9588662f358597f500f-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7495723f38cec4735ef5d9588662f358597f500f-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7495723f38cec4735ef5d9588662f358597f500f-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>It seems obvious, but designers won’t just automatically discover the hackathon you’ve pitched to the compsci club on campus. They run in different circles than engineers, so you’ll have to tap your network and do some digging to furrow them out. Contact your school’s art department to find out if there’s a Facebook group or flyer board you can post on. Research local design and art schools in the area and invite their students to join the hackathon. If you’re really committed — and have the sponsorship funds — maybe even offer to charter buses to bring designers over from nearby areas.</p><p>A few of the early Hack@Brown organizers were taking extra classes at the Rhode Island School of Design, so they had an automatic in with design students there. But they also contacted Parsons in New York City and Northeastern, which has a design club called Scout. A few Scout students agreed to attend Hack@Brown in the early years, but that was about it. “It was much harder to get designers to come then,” former Hack@Brown organizer Atty Eleti remembers. “There was less awareness of hackathons.”</p><h2 id="step-2-woo-them"><a href="#step-2-woo-them">Step 2 — Woo them</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d343b00fd535cd121b4d71f64061fc46b2553e62-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;h=406&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d343b00fd535cd121b4d71f64061fc46b2553e62-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d343b00fd535cd121b4d71f64061fc46b2553e62-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d343b00fd535cd121b4d71f64061fc46b2553e62-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d343b00fd535cd121b4d71f64061fc46b2553e62-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Just finding designers isn’t enough. You’ll have to convince them that attending your event is worthwhile. Slapping “Hackathon! Loads of prizes!” on a sign won’t be enough to persuade designers to show up. They respond to — shocker! — good design. Make sure you have artists or visual thinkers on your own hackathon organizing committee who create flyers, gifs or other communication design with a distinct brand.</p><p>While imagery matters, so does text — try experimenting with marketing messaging, instead of sticking to standard hacker fare. With Hack@Brown, Eleti and his team changed the text on flyers from the traditional “24 hours, $20,000 in prizes” to focusing on the team building and creative aspects of the event with the tagline “Make, play, learn.” They believed the more inclusive language would help convince designers that they could contribute to a hackathon team.</p><h2 id="step-3-check-your-application-process"><a href="#step-3-check-your-application-process">Step 3 — Check your application process</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ac68d6ce54410e0be8dd789271caa0e655b1c6c4-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;h=406&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ac68d6ce54410e0be8dd789271caa0e655b1c6c4-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ac68d6ce54410e0be8dd789271caa0e655b1c6c4-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ac68d6ce54410e0be8dd789271caa0e655b1c6c4-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ac68d6ce54410e0be8dd789271caa0e655b1c6c4-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>If your hackathon chooses participants via applications, make sure you’re not subconsciously weeding out designers (or other candidates from unique backgrounds). Either set up a lottery system, reserving a certain amount of spots for designers, or vet design candidates through an entirely different process. Make sure you have design experts helping judge applications.</p><p>Once Hack@Brown grew big enough, the organizers used a lottery system to ensure the representation of different types of groups (they typically receive 3,000 applications for 500 slots). They accept at least 15 percent designers compared to engineers, but also at least 50 percent women, 20–30 percent people who’d never attended a hackathon before, and other traits. As you’d imagine, the diversity of thinking led to more innovative and varied hackathon projects coming from the teams.</p><h2 id="step-4-build-a-design-friendly-event"><a href="#step-4-build-a-design-friendly-event">Step 4 — Build a design friendly event</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/af0bdccd6d4f2a022947a3177fe3463c9ad4dbf2-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;h=406&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/af0bdccd6d4f2a022947a3177fe3463c9ad4dbf2-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/af0bdccd6d4f2a022947a3177fe3463c9ad4dbf2-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/af0bdccd6d4f2a022947a3177fe3463c9ad4dbf2-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/af0bdccd6d4f2a022947a3177fe3463c9ad4dbf2-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>In the long term, recruiting designers isn’t enough. If you want them to keep coming back, you’ll need to create a space that represents their interests and needs as much as the computer programmers. That can take a lot of forms, but here’s a quick list:</p><p>Host design workshops during or leading up to the event to either teach students how to best incorporate design into their hackathon process or to give them a basic overview of the UX/UI design world.<br/>Consider hosting a mixer for designers during the hackathon in the evening so they can meet fellow designers at the event and feel a little less like lost sheep brought to the slaughter.</p><p>Bring in design mentors from tech companies to give advice to teams. Design mentors with coding skills are even better — they can help the designers and engineers work together.</p><p>Invite design recruiters from tech companies to help students find jobs and internships. Recruiters don’t naturally think of hackathons as the best place to find design students, so figure out how to attract them. For example, Eleti and his team deliberately made sure Hack@Brown happened the week after the Brown and RISD career fairs, so recruiters could meet as many students as possible in a short time.</p><h2 id="step-5-reward-designers-to-help-them-feel-welcome"><a href="#step-5-reward-designers-to-help-them-feel-welcome">Step 5 — Reward designers to help them feel welcome</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/07a655ca596bbbcaaa635e7aea2e9da2ac17bbec-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;h=406&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/07a655ca596bbbcaaa635e7aea2e9da2ac17bbec-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/07a655ca596bbbcaaa635e7aea2e9da2ac17bbec-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/07a655ca596bbbcaaa635e7aea2e9da2ac17bbec-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/07a655ca596bbbcaaa635e7aea2e9da2ac17bbec-1000x606.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>If you want designers to come back next year — and bring their friends — a little recognition goes a long way. In addition to giving out awards for best use of APIs or other coding skills, highlight projects with the best design or usability. Engineers will often be gifted things like AWS credits, so see if you can offer designers free design tool subscriptions or trials (Figma is free for students, by the way, and always will be).</p><p>Are you trying to incorporate more design into your school’s hackathon?

Recently we celebrated our one year anniversary here at Figma, and we wanted to do something fun and unexpected for our community.</p><p>I’ve had a number of conversations with users who were quick to point out how fast we were shipping. One morning, after yet another tweet saying, “I can’t wait to see what Figma does next year” I replied, “Next year? Just wait until next week!” Yes, I’m terrible at keeping secrets and I knew we were launching features the following week.</p><p>In a meeting later that day I suggested we ship a new feature each day from Monday through Saturday. The team agreed and #6DaysofShipping was born!</p><p>From power user functionality, like nested instance swapping, to beginner-level tips, like our complete keyboard shortcut list, we hope we delivered something for everyone. A mixed bag perhaps, but as it turned out, it was a fun week for us, and people looked forward to what each day would bring.</p><p>ICYMI, here’s a quick recap of Figma’s #6DaysofShipping celebration:</p><h2 id="scrubbable-inputs"><a href="#scrubbable-inputs">Scrubbable inputs</a></h2><p><a href="https://help.figma.com/properties-panel/positions-dimensions">(Help content)</a></p><h2 id="shortcut-for-rounding-corner-radii"><a href="#shortcut-for-rounding-corner-radii">Shortcut for rounding corner radii</a></h2><p><a href="https://help.figma.com/faqs/how-do-i-round-corners">(Help content)</a></p><h2 id="figma-embedly"><a href="#figma-embedly">Figma + Embedly</a></h2><h2 id="uniform-grids"><a href="#uniform-grids">Uniform grids</a></h2><p><a href="https://help.figma.com/properties-panel/layout-grids">(Help content)</a></p><h2 id="nested-instance-swapping-for-local-components"><a href="#nested-instance-swapping-for-local-components">Nested instance swapping for local components</a></h2><p><a href="https://help.figma.com/drawing/components">(Help content)</a></p><h2 id="in-app-keyboard-shortcuts-for-windows-and-mac"><a href="#in-app-keyboard-shortcuts-for-windows-and-mac">In-app keyboard shortcuts for Windows and Mac users</a></h2><p><a href="https://help.figma.com/keyboard-shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts">(Help content)</a></p><p>If you can’t tell, we’re having a lot of fun taking Figma to the next level. Now that we’ve nailed the foundation of our platform, we want to make using it as powerful, effortless and enjoyable as possible.</p><p>Do you have feature suggestions, or just want to chat about Figma? Kick off a conversation over on our user forum and keep the conversations coming.</p><p>And of course, stay tuned for what’s next…In fact, we couldn’t help ourselves and have another release later today.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>This Twitter storm shows design systems are still up for debate</title>

      <description>Ask any designer for a one-size-fits-all definition of design systems and you’re bound to receive scattered answers, or even a not-so-subtle change in subject.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ask any designer for a one-size-fits-all definition of design systems and you’re bound to receive scattered answers, or even a not-so-subtle change in subject. It’s 2017 and industry thought leaders are still molding this nebulous concept. In fact, Airbnb’s Design Language System Lead Karri Saarinen brewed up a Twitter storm of opinion only yesterday.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d0297f381bcc4a237c101601be8cdb9e1ba5485-800x876.jpg?w=670&amp;h=734&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d0297f381bcc4a237c101601be8cdb9e1ba5485-800x876.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d0297f381bcc4a237c101601be8cdb9e1ba5485-800x876.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d0297f381bcc4a237c101601be8cdb9e1ba5485-800x876.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0d0297f381bcc4a237c101601be8cdb9e1ba5485-800x876.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Photo courtesy of Kaari Saarinen</figcaption></figure><p>Last year he publicly ruminated on the subject by writing a treatise posted on Airbnb’s design blog. He explained in order to succeed at scale, design teams must have a design system. Larger, long-term projects need constraints and consistency across platforms. With principles like unified, universal, iconic and conversational in his arsenal, he set out to form a design system for Airbnb, documenting the process for all to see.</p><p>But yesterday’s digital maelstrom allowed for a public tête-à-tête between him and other thought leaders, including Sean Blanton, a Product Designer at Facebook. While it is literally Saarinen’s job to define the subject, it’s fascinating to watch the concept solidify in real-time and whittled down to its true core by designers both new and experienced. Below are some of the more illuminating tweets.</p><p>At just 16 words, Saarinen’s first tweet was the skeleton key for design systems: “set of shared and integrated principles and patterns that define the overall design of a product.” He then went on to define or extrapolate on several of those words. Patterns could be patterns and/or components. The design of the product refers to how the end product feels and looks. And so on.</p><p>Then Sean Blanton jumped in, remarking on the shortcomings of language and how that can lead to a smashed beehive of expectations. If we can’t agree on definitions for seemingly simple words, how can we build a consistent framework? Blanton advised, “Always pay attention to the words you’d tend to never look up in the dictionary.”</p><p>At Figma, we’re doing our best to address the obstacles design teams face when creating a design system. Our recent release of Team Library 1.0 empowers teams to create, use and maintain design systems through elevated organization, component documentation, an advanced search system and an intuitive UI redesign.</p><p>And while I’m still dancing on my own digital soapbox, Twitter could learn something from the beauty of design constraints too, what with their recent pivot to 280-characters.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Introducing Figma’s Live Embed Kit</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-live-embed-kit/</link>
      <description>Add real-time Figma designs &amp; prototypes to any website or tool</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re excited to announce our public Live Embed Kit to keep teams in sync wherever they are. With this development, anyone can add Figma designs and prototypes that are always up to date to their website. It’s as simple as embedding an iframe. The Kit will also allow 3rd party developers to enable Figma Live Embeds in their own tools — just like Trello, JIRA and Dropbox Paper.</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s as simple as embedding an iframe.</p></blockquote></div><p>To insert a Figma design or prototype into any webpage, just click share in the top right corner of the file, select public embed and copy the iframe code. If you’re a developer and want to make it easier for your users to embed live Figma documents, follow the instructions here.</p><p>We’re really excited to see what the community builds with this. Here’s a few examples of where live, synchronized designs could be helpful:</p><ul><li>Do you run an internal wiki for your company? Add Figma and people can post live designs to articles about projects or features.</li><li>Are you building a messaging app for teams? Connect Figma and your users can share the latest versions of designs in group chats.</li><li>Do you want to blog about a project you’re working on? Embed a live Figma file and your readers will always see the most recent version of your design.</li></ul><h2 id="live-embed-in-action-with-trello"><a href="#live-embed-in-action-with-trello">Live Embed in action with Trello:</a></h2><p>Since Figma is the only design tool that runs on the web, these embedded designs will stay up to date and synchronized with the Figma original. Whenever a designer makes a tiny padding tweak or changes an icon in the Figma file itself, they can rest easy without having to re-export or re-upload the design.</p><p>We hope integrations like these will keep teams in sync and save them the hassle of hunting through the annals of their email history, mountain of Slack chats, or folders of their file sharing services.</p><p>This is only the beginning of our platform efforts. We’re excited to harness the power of our web-based technology to help teams communicate and build better products faster. Up next — stay tuned for a Figma API that will allow developers to pull other types of information from Figma files and incorporate them into new workflows. If you’re interested in partnering, shoot us a line at partners@figma.com.</p><p>For more details on how to integrate Figma Live Embeds into your website or tool, check out our <a href="https://www.figma.com/developers/embed">documentation</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Team Library 1.0</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/team-library-1-0/</link>
      <description>We’re excited to announce Team Library 1.0, which empowers teams to create, use and maintain design systems.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re excited to announce Team Library 1.0, which empowers teams to create, use and maintain design systems. We introduced the beta version in February, and since then we’ve talked to hundreds of people about how they’re adopting it. We evolved the functionality based on feedback, and with today’s launch, we hope to make it easier for a wide range of teams to build their own design systems.</p><p>Components — buttons, icons, dialogs and whathaveyou — play a crucial role in many companies’ design systems. Organizations need the ability to share these elements widely across files and with team members. That way everyone can design in a structured manner and stay up-to-date with projects. Several companies have even gone to the extreme of developing their own tooling for this part of their design system. For instance, Airbnb and Facebook have hired experts to maintain and create such internal software.</p><p>We believe component sharing is key to design at scale, so we prioritized it in our product roadmap and released our Team Library beta way back in February. That was mere months after Figma launched to the public. Since then, many companies have used the feature to design in more consistent and efficient ways, and their insights helped guide our development process for the 1.0 version.</p><p>Since Figma is online and centralized, we believe we’re uniquely suited to help teams systematize their design. All projects and documents stay up to date in one place without exporting, syncing or sharing. A Figma Team Library is a single source of truth, forming the key foundation for a stable and living design system.</p><h2 id="with-figma-you-can-stop"><a href="#with-figma-you-can-stop">With Figma you can stop:</a></h2><ul><li>Syncing with third-party cloud services just to use your team’s component library</li><li>Praying nothing goes wrong with all the tools you’ve hacked together to use your company’s design system</li><li>Hunting down the right component like you’re starring in the world’s worst detective series</li></ul><p>When you publish or make changes to a shared component in Figma, you can trust that everyone instantly sees the new component in the Team Library. You’ll also receive a notification when anyone else updates a component in another file, and you can decide whether to apply the changes to your own instances.</p><h2 id="before-and-after-the-team-library-evolution"><a href="#before-and-after-the-team-library-evolution">Before and after: The Team Library evolution</a></h2><p>We launched our beta as a bare bones feature, with the goal of studying our users to understand what they most needed. We soon realized that even for a beta version, our original Team Library was too simple. In fact, it was quite limiting for the people pushing the boundaries of design systems.</p><h3 id="team-library-ui"><a href="#team-library-ui">Team Library UI</a></h3><p><strong>Old</strong>: In our beta, you’d have to use a pop-up again and again to browse for the components you needed. If that wasn’t tedious enough, the pop up also hid your canvas, so you couldn’t make fast iterations on your design. The UI clunkiness slowed the design process to an unbearable crawl.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c231f6e9bd5706d6320c6a93595b3e3e86f02c8d-1000x359.png?rect=1,0,998,359&amp;w=670&amp;h=241&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c231f6e9bd5706d6320c6a93595b3e3e86f02c8d-1000x359.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c231f6e9bd5706d6320c6a93595b3e3e86f02c8d-1000x359.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c231f6e9bd5706d6320c6a93595b3e3e86f02c8d-1000x359.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c231f6e9bd5706d6320c6a93595b3e3e86f02c8d-1000x359.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 998w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><strong>New</strong>: Now all your team’s components are available directly beside your design, in a new tab in the left-hand sidebar where you work with your layers. When you need an instance of a component, simply drag it from the sidebar into your design.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Tip</strong>: Quickly switch left-hand sidebar tabs with alt+1</p><p>Additionally in that left-hand sidebar, there’s a third tab where you can see an overview of your local components. That makes publishing them to your Team Library easier because you’re able to see exactly what will show up in your library before publishing some changes.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/127984901b964842bf5de790b9d1da6edc98a788-800x486.png?w=670&amp;h=407&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/127984901b964842bf5de790b9d1da6edc98a788-800x486.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/127984901b964842bf5de790b9d1da6edc98a788-800x486.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/127984901b964842bf5de790b9d1da6edc98a788-800x486.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/127984901b964842bf5de790b9d1da6edc98a788-800x486.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="documentation"><a href="#documentation">Documentation</a></h3><p><strong>Old</strong>: Designers need ways to communicate component behavior, so their teammates know when, why and how to use specific elements. In our beta version, we had no place for documentation, so that kind of information wound up stranded in Slack or buried in Google Docs instead of where it should be — tied to the component itself.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a70415e3a5ac0425005df026506a0fd773bb58e6-1000x488.png?w=670&amp;h=327&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a70415e3a5ac0425005df026506a0fd773bb58e6-1000x488.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a70415e3a5ac0425005df026506a0fd773bb58e6-1000x488.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a70415e3a5ac0425005df026506a0fd773bb58e6-1000x488.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a70415e3a5ac0425005df026506a0fd773bb58e6-1000x488.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><strong>New</strong>: Now with a component selected, you can add information about it in the right-hand properties panel. Teammates can then view the component documentation you created when they browse components in the Team Library.</p><h3 id="categorization"><a href="#categorization">Categorization</a></h3><p><strong>Old</strong>: A key part of a functioning design system is organization. Our beta version of Team Library only allowed categorization of components by file, so things got messy.</p><figure></figure><p>Categorize by frame and group in Team Library 1.0</p><p><strong>New</strong>: Now you can see your components organized by group and frame in the Team Library in addition to file. For instance if you collect all your button components in a group and name it “Buttons,” you’ll see the thumbnails appear together under “Buttons” in both the Components and Team Library tabs of the left-hand sidebar.</p><p><strong>Tip</strong>: Set the background of a shared component by changing the containing frame’s background color</p><h2 id="learn-more"><a href="#learn-more">Learn more</a></h2><p>If you’re curious to learn more about Team Library and the new sidebar tabs, we’ve prepared this video that walks through everything in detail as well as this help center article outlining everything you need to know. If you’re new to components or want to learn more about them, have a look at this article from when we first launched our component feature.</p><p>As design becomes more integrated into companies large and small, the need for communication and formalization of design process has grown rapidly. We hope Team Library 1.0 will help teams with the collaborative nature of building cohesive products at scale.</p><p>A big thanks to everyone who supported us through this feature development cycle— your feedback inspired and defined our 1.0 vision.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Introducing Live Embed of Figma designs in Trello &amp; Jira Software</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-live-embed-of-figma-designs-in-trello-and-jira-software/</link>
      <description>The tech world lives in Atlassian project management tools like Trello and Jira Software.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The tech world lives in Atlassian project management tools like Trello and Jira Software. They’re the go-to places for teams to coordinate deadlines, plan tasks, share new information, and ship products at a much faster rate.</p><p>That’s why we’re so excited about today’s big news: You can now add Figma files as Live Embeds in Trello and Jira Software. Make any changes to your original design in Figma — tweak padding, try a new font color — and your embedded Figma design will automatically update in your Trello card or Jira ticket. No extra work from you required.</p><p>With Live Embed, everyone building a product will always know the state of the current design.</p><p>That’s right…gone are the days where designers have to spend hours hunting for the right project card so they can keep developers, product managers, marketers and other teammates in the loop. You stop exhaustively uploading design PNGs that went out of date as soon as you exported them.</p><p>“Software teams constantly struggle with knowing where to find the latest designs,” said Bryant Lee, Head of Product Partnerships and Integrations at Atlassian. “We’re excited to team up with Figma, and believe their live embed capability with Jira Software and Trello will streamline communication between designers and developers.”</p><p>This is just the beginning of the integrations we hope to power at Figma. Since we’re the only design tool that runs on the web, we have a unique opportunity to introduce Live Embeds to different workflows. As you may have seen, our Atlassian feature mirrors a similar capability we recently launched with Dropbox Paper. In the future, you’ll find us wherever designers and their teams need us.</p><p>To get started, just enable the Figma integration in Atlassian’s marketplace for Jira Software and paste the URL in the design section of a Jira ticket. In Trello, you can turn on Figma as a Power-Up for your team, and then you can add a Figma URL as a Trello card attachment. We have help content on the Jira embed process here and Trello embed here.</p><p>Let us know what you think of the new technology — we’d love to hear how Live Embed changes your workflow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma + Dropbox Paper</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-dropbox-paper/</link>
      <description>Huzzah! As of today Figma content can live in Dropbox Paper as a live embed.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Huzzah! As of today Figma content can live in Dropbox Paper as a live embed. This integration will lessen headaches for the whole company, whether you’re a project manager, engineer or product designer. Instead of hopelessly searching for the most up-to-date version of a design file, Figma designs and prototypes embedded within a Paper doc will now immediately update, ensuring everyone is on the same page all the time.</p><p>Dropbox Paper is a new type of doc for teams to create and collaborate together. Available to anyone with a Dropbox account, Paper already has integrations with indispensable services such as YouTube, GitHub and Facebook. We couldn’t be more excited to get added to the list.</p><p>Making it easier for teams to collaborate around design has always been Figma’s main purpose. With this “living canvas” keeping teams in context inside of Paper, we’ve branched out to include a multi-disciplinary approach to getting stuff done.</p><h2 id="how-easy-can-it-be"><a href="#how-easy-can-it-be">How easy can it be?</a></h2><p>It’s as simple as copy/pasting. Command + V the URL to your Figma project into Dropbox Paper and the living document will appear immediately. Because all parts of the app that weren’t relevant were stripped out, the code for the live embed is extraordinarily lightweight and fast.</p><p>We hope you are as excited as we are to start using this integration. Head on over to Dropbox Paper today and try it out!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Happy Emoji Release Day at Figma 🎉</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/happy-emoji-release-day-at-figma/</link>
      <description>Happy emoji release day! 🎉 We’re excited to announce that your favorite pictorial minions now work in Figma.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Happy emoji release day! 🎉 We’re excited to announce that your favorite pictorial minions now work in Figma. Since our public launch in September we have received a ton of requests for emoji support, to the point where some teams even left Figma in protest (I kid you not).</p><p>It actually took us awhile to figure out teams were churning due to lack of emoji support. Much like seeing the 1 star Emoji Movie in theaters, few would confess to this openly and admit how much those tiny yellow faces mean to them.</p><p>We understand the sentiment — it’s 2017 and emojis are no longer optional. They’re the visual language of the digital world, employed to express tone, emotion and nuance across both consumer and enterprise products.</p><div><blockquote><p>It’s easy to add emojis in Figma. If you’re working on Mac, hit control+command+spacebar. On Windows, open the touch keyboard and click on the smiley face emoji icon.</p></blockquote></div><p>People building interfaces in Figma need emoji support to get a realistic sense of how their designs will function in the wild. Advertising copy is more relatable with cute smidgens of 😉 or an impish dash of 😜. Texts, tweets and emails would be incomplete without healthy sprinklings of 💃 and 🎉. As Arnold from “Master of None” so eloquently phrased it, “I want kissy or I want red hearts only.”</p><p>So, why did it take us so long to introduce emoji functionality in Figma? When it comes to implementation, these fanciful creatures are tricky buggers, prone to mistranslation across operating systems. The standard emoji sets are owned by the Facebooks, Apples and Googles of the world.</p><p>If you’re curious about the underlying systems that power these ubiquitous pictograms — and how Figma built our emoji system — then this post is for you.</p><h2 id="the-history-of-the-glyph"><a href="#the-history-of-the-glyph">The history of the glyph</a></h2><p>Emojis are glyphs with pizazz. In 1999 they burst into being after an employee at a Japanese mobile phone operator realized the limitations of text. He created 176 characters to help communicate emotion, and the idea took off. Phone carriers watched jealously as emojis spread and soon began building their own versions to compete.</p><p>Over the years, communication chaos grew as different carriers failed to render other carriers’ emoji sets accurately. In 2009, the Unicode Consortium stepped in to clean up the mess. For the uninitiated, that’s a non-profit coalition of tech companies and other individuals who release an international set of guidelines for representing text. It provides unique code identifiers for every character of every major language, dead or alive.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d6a19e023f8c0e34d13a9918d31d6a880cdbf471-800x325.jpg?w=670&amp;h=272&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d6a19e023f8c0e34d13a9918d31d6a880cdbf471-800x325.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d6a19e023f8c0e34d13a9918d31d6a880cdbf471-800x325.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d6a19e023f8c0e34d13a9918d31d6a880cdbf471-800x325.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d6a19e023f8c0e34d13a9918d31d6a880cdbf471-800x325.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The Original Emoji, by Shigetaka Kurita (credit MoMA)<br/>When the Unicode standards committee acknowledged emojis as a pictorial language, they created design guidelines for how to draw them, as well as code that maps to specific emoji. For example, U+1F355, the most beloved of all emojis, is “pizza.” 🍕🍕🍕</p><p>As long as applications and operating systems follow the general Unicode guidelines, they’re free to use artistic license to interpret the emoji’s appearance. Thus, Facebook pizza looks different from Twitter pizza, which diverges from iOS pizza, which is a far cry from the renderings of LG, Samsung…you get the point.</p><p>Maybe you’ve lived through this struggle: you think you’re sending your Tinder crush a sheepish grimace via iOS, but on their Android device it morphs into a serial killer. Who knows how many hapless victims were ghosted due to an emoji’s cross-platform identity crisis.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/265fb735d3b67a3e02dfd689157f6a41e24afd6c-600x298.png?w=670&amp;h=333&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/265fb735d3b67a3e02dfd689157f6a41e24afd6c-600x298.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/265fb735d3b67a3e02dfd689157f6a41e24afd6c-600x298.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/265fb735d3b67a3e02dfd689157f6a41e24afd6c-600x298.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 600w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Sheepish grimace or serial killer?</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-figma-way"><a href="#the-figma-way">The Figma way</a></h2><p>This kind of mistranslation is a disaster in communication or collaboration applications like Figma. We work cross-platform, so we need to make sure that designers jumping into a file on Windows are seeing the same designs as their fellow colleagues using Macs. Allowing browsers to render emojis with their own operating system library just wasn’t an option.</p><p>When researching how we could implement emojis, we looked to other companies for inspiration. Slack in particular found a creative workaround for the problem. They decided to make Apple’s emojis their product standard and built a massive PNG file of Apple emojis that Slack hosts itself. The Slack app downloads the PNG file to have on hand. Then, whenever a user calls for an emoji Slack only presents the relevant section of the image. With this method, inserting emoji is very fast. However, this is at the expense of color quality and it’s not possible to render these emoji at larger sizes.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46eb444ecdf54dd9333c529eaf18cb37112c26db-800x800.png?w=670&amp;h=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46eb444ecdf54dd9333c529eaf18cb37112c26db-800x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46eb444ecdf54dd9333c529eaf18cb37112c26db-800x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46eb444ecdf54dd9333c529eaf18cb37112c26db-800x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46eb444ecdf54dd9333c529eaf18cb37112c26db-800x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Grainy emojis don’t matter much for Slack’s chat screens (you barely notice it), but we quickly realized that method wouldn’t work for Figma. Our users are designers — a discerning visual audience if there ever was one. Low-res anything would drive them crazy and degrade their design process, so we needed a different tactic.</p><p>We decided to use 64x64 full color PNGs for each individual emoji (compared to Slack’s all-in-one image). There is a slight delay the first time you add a specific emoji, but we cache it so that subsequent uses are fast. This lets you keep a version handy that will be higher-res than if it had been pulled from one mammoth PNG and also helps make Figma more memory efficient.</p><p>💁<br/>And that’s a wrap! We’re thrilled to be releasing this fun new feature for the Figma family.</p><p>As a parting note: we love listening to user’s needs, incorporating those suggestions and making the lives of designers a little more colorful. So, please keep sending recommendations our way on how to make Figma a better design tool.</p><p>Happy 👩‍💻 🤓 👾!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma 2.0: Now with Prototyping and Developer Handoff</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-2-0-now-with-prototyping-and-developer-handoff/</link>
      <description>Figma introduces prototyping and developer handoff</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Big news in the Figma house today — we’re excited to finally unveil <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> 2.0. It’s an expanded version of the product you love (or at least like a lot, right 😉?) with significant new features: Prototyping and Developer Handoff.</p><p>In Figma 1.0, we laid the foundation for design in the cloud, creating a product that wouldn’t require any saving, exporting, syncing, or emailing. We built features to help designers work better together, like <a href="https://blog.figma.com/multiplayer-editing-in-figma-8f8076c6c3a6">multi-player functionality</a> and <a href="https://blog.figma.com/team-libraries-in-figma-409fa5e20f7">team component libraries</a>.</p><p>In the months after our public launch, we learned more about the depth and breadth of designers’ pain points — namely, that they stretch far beyond the friction of working with fellow designers. For a truly streamlined workflow, designers need to be able to collaborate with everyone from the marketing department to the executive team to the engineers building their designs.</p><div><blockquote><p>If Figma 1.0 focused on making it easier for designers to collaborate, Figma 2.0 is about empowering entire teams.</p></blockquote></div><p>Our true north has always been helping people build better software together, and Figma 2.0 is the next chapter.</p><h2 id="prototyping"><a href="#prototyping">Prototyping</a></h2><figure></figure><p>Designers need a way to present their work that’s expressive, clean and intuitive. Whether to show work to fellow designers for feedback, pitch plans to executives for final approval, or see how users interact with interfaces during testing, prototypes play a key role in the tech design process.</p><p>For months, our users have asked for this kind of feature, but we’ve dodged their requests. We <a href="https://blog.figma.com/introducing-figmas-integration-with-framer-c69a747aeee2">already integrate with great products like Framer</a> that have made this their core competency, and we’ve wanted to stay focused on building a world-class design tool.</p><p>But as we talked to more of our users, we realized we couldn’t ignore prototyping forever. Designers were desperate for a solution that would let them create and present in the same place, with one single source of truth. Since we’re the only interface design tool that runs on the web, we’re uniquely suited to meet that demand.</p><h3 id="fun-figma-fied-features"><a href="#fun-figma-fied-features">Fun Figma-fied features</a></h3><p>Although Figma’s prototyping feature doesn’t cover all scenarios, it works for the needs of many of our users. During early research, almost all the designers we talked to asked for slideshows and hot spot functionality over advanced motion graphics.</p><div><blockquote><p>In Figma, the prototype is a living document rather than a dead artifact.</p></blockquote></div><p>We’re excited by the opportunities our cloud-based technology affords us here. In Figma, the prototype is a living document rather than a dead artifact. As you make changes to the original design, they’ll be reflected in real time in your presentations… no exporting or syncing necessary.</p><p><strong>A few unique features:</strong></p><ul><li>You can tweak frames or add screens in real time while others watch. We’re already finding this hugely helpful in design critiques at Figma.</li><li>No need for endless versioning…or the crazy naming conventions that other tools require to order your artboards (good-bye artboard 1, artboard a1, artboard a1b, artboard a1bcdefgahhhhhfuckthis).</li><li>My new fav: You can navigate presentations from your phone. Any designers who dream of strolling the conference room like you’re giving a TED talk, this is your moment.</li><li>You can use components (symbols) with hot spots, so when you set a navigation from a component once, it will populate through all instances, as seen in the gif below (the component is the top left X button):</li></ul><figure></figure><p>To build a prototype, select the ‘prototype mode’ in the right hand properties panel and connect frames via nodes. You can turn different objects into hot spots, so when people interact with components of the design they’re taken to designated screens. Alternatively, you can create a simple presentation by ordering your frames on the canvas. </p><p>Ultimately, prototyping in Figma is about removing layers of abstraction between the design and the presentation. To meet the needs of designers with different workflows, we’ll continue to integrate with other dedicated prototyping tools.</p><h2 id="developer-handoff"><a href="#developer-handoff">Developer handoff</a></h2><p>The second big change in Figma is our new developer handoff feature. Designers can now share files with view-only access to developers, who will see a ‘code’ mode tab in the right hand properties panel.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3b055689cdf198c9ddf8ffffcb8c178b8ff258e-1080x824.png?w=670&amp;h=511&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3b055689cdf198c9ddf8ffffcb8c178b8ff258e-1080x824.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3b055689cdf198c9ddf8ffffcb8c178b8ff258e-1080x824.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3b055689cdf198c9ddf8ffffcb8c178b8ff258e-1080x824.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3b055689cdf198c9ddf8ffffcb8c178b8ff258e-1080x824.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c3b055689cdf198c9ddf8ffffcb8c178b8ff258e-1080x824.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1080w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="the-high-level"><a href="#the-high-level">The high level</a></h3><ul><li>Developers can select an object and hover over another object to see redlines that measure the spacing between them.</li><li>They can pull CSS, iOS and Android data with view-only access.</li><li>We’ve segmented the data as:<br/>(1) Table view, which breaks out attributes so they’re easier to skim</li></ul><p>(2) Generated markup/code</p><p>We believe in making design as accessible as possible, so we hope this will empower your team. You’ll no longer need to pay for engineers to have editor seats — instead, they can count as free ‘view only’ individuals. Check out more information in our tutorial video below:</p><h2 id="the-next-chapter"><a href="#the-next-chapter">The next chapter</a></h2><p>We’re excited to offer an all in one tool to help teams work better together. That said, we know that designers and tech companies have a wide variety of workflows and requirements.</p><p>Figma plays in a broader, vibrant ecosystem, and for our next steps we’re looking forward to integrating with other tools in the space. We’re forging our first partnerships for a broader platform, so if you’re interested in working with us, please shoot us a line.</p><p>In the meanwhile, let us know what you think of Figma 2.0!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Photo Filters Come To Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/photo-filters-come-to-figma/</link>
      <description>Figma&#39;s new Image Adjustments features</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Did you know <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> got its start as a Photoshop competitor? Back in 2012, our co-founder and CTO, Evan Wallace, had a lot of fun pushing the power of browser technology with photo filters and masks.</p><p>Now, years later, we’re returning to our roots in one small way. We’re introducing a new Image Adjustment feature in Figma that will let you modify the exposure, contrast, saturation, temperature, tint, highlights and shadows of your photos.</p><p>These are quick fixes that will make tech designers’ lives a lot easier — no more exporting photos to Photoshop or figuring out strange Figma hacks just to darken an image. Once you drag a picture into the Figma canvas, you can select image filtering options under “fill” in the right-hand properties panel.</p><p>We invested a lot of time in making our ranges balanced, so we hope you’ll find them useful. For example, images won’t blow out at the high end of the exposure range.</p><p>This of course does not replace the need for a professional image editing tool. Rather, we created it to help designers make quick adjustments when necessary. Let us know what you think!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Introducing BrowserView for Electron</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-browserview-for-electron/</link>
      <description>Figma Introduces BrowserView for Electron</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, we believe everyone should have access to design tools. We chose the web as our platform for its unrivaled accessibility (sharing a Figma file is as simple as sharing a link!). On the flip side, we have had to work extra hard to make Figma fast and competitive against native applications. For example, <a href="https://blog.figma.com/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web-6332ed4f1fcc">we render our canvas entirely with WebGL </a>and <a href="https://blog.figma.com/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x-76f3f2395164">recently released a WebAssembly version of our app.</a></p><p>For our desktop app, we doubled down on the web by going with <a href="https://electronjs.org/">Electron</a>, a framework to build desktop apps using web technologies. As with our web app, we have worked diligently to make Electron as fast as possible for our needs, tackling smaller bugs and working with Chrome to fix issues that affect Electron.</p><p>One of our most important contributions to the Electron project is <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-view.md">BrowserView</a>, a new way to embed web apps with fewer bugs and improved performance. It is included in the latest Electron beta release — you can find <a href="https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/browser-view.md">documentation here</a>. It makes the framework faster and more reliable and some companies have already told us they’ll be adopting BrowserView in the future. Heads up that it’s still an experimental API and we’re planning to refine it further.</p><p>To explain why BrowserView matters, let’s take a step back to discuss the state of things before now.</p><h4 id="embedding-web-apps-with"><a href="#embedding-web-apps-with">Embedding web apps with </a></h4><p>Each Electron window usually runs a web app from the local disk. The standard approach to embed remote web apps into an Electron window is to use the <code>&lt;webview&gt;</code> element. It is conceptually similar to an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, except that its contents are rendered in a completely separate process. This has a number of performance, security, and stability benefits compared to the plain old iframe.</p><p>Many of the most popular Electron applications like Slack and WhatsApp use webviews. For us, webviews seemed to work well at first, but over time we ran into an ever growing list of issues. There were bugs in fundamental features like drag-and-drop and general performance was simply not on par with Chrome. After discussions with other organizations, it became apparent that we were not alone.</p><p>The situation is especially problematic because we can’t fix these issues in Electron itself. As you may know, Electron uses the Chromium open source project to render web content. The webview is actually implemented in Chromium and also happens to be used by Chrome Apps and Chrome extensions. Unfortunately making large changes to Chromium is out of the question, so we have been waiting for the Chrome team to fix the bugs.</p><p>We raised the issue with the Electron maintainers and together we decided that the most pragmatic solution was to sidestep webview entirely and build an alternative: BrowserView.</p><h4 id=""><a href="#"></a></h4><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/58d0e142f2a13c622de4ee3b494174ac846951f4-1000x430.png?w=670&amp;h=288&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/58d0e142f2a13c622de4ee3b494174ac846951f4-1000x430.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/58d0e142f2a13c622de4ee3b494174ac846951f4-1000x430.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/58d0e142f2a13c622de4ee3b494174ac846951f4-1000x430.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/58d0e142f2a13c622de4ee3b494174ac846951f4-1000x430.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1000w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>So how is the BrowserView different? For one, while webview is part of the DOM hierarchy, BrowserView lives in the operating system window hierarchy. This approach is very similar to how Chrome manages its tabs. Since bugs in Chrome’s tabs are critical and fixed quickly, we eliminated a large class of bugs specific to webview. Web apps running within a BrowserView are also as fast as they are in Chrome.</p><p>The trade-off is that positioning and layering BrowserViews is trickier because you can no longer use the normal HTML and CSS positioning and layering primitives like you can with a webview. You have to manually layout BrowserViews and make sure that it is layered properly. For some applications with complex layering and positioning, this may be a deal breaker, but for many applications including Figma, it was a straightforward conversion.</p><h4 id=""><a href="#"></a></h4><p>Electron has allowed us to quickly build a fully fledged, cross platform desktop app. While neither the web platform nor Electron are perfect, both are evolving rapidly and receptive to contributions. In fact, Electron receives frequent contributions from companies like Slack and Microsoft. At Figma, we remain committed to helping Electron improve.</p><p>We just released <a href="https://releases.figma.com/2017/06/figma-desktop-20.html">Figma Desktop 2.0</a> and shipped BrowserView to our users. As we continue to make Electron and BrowserView better, we hope that other apps will also migrate to BrowserView for a more pleasant desktop experience.</p><p><em>Like working on state-of-the-art web apps? <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">Come work at Figma</a>!</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Figma now has Guides</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/figma-now-has-guides/</link>
      <description>figma guides</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hey folks! I’m Shirley, one of Figma’s new <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">summer interns</a>. My first project here was a fun one — the team tasked me with building Guides (alongside fellow engineer Kenrick Rilee).</p><p>From the dawn of Figma time, our users have begged us for this feature. Appeals rolled in morning, noon and night — 100 requests in the last six months alone, from places as far flung as Lagos, Nigeria and Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p><p>We heard you loud and clear, which is why Figma put me on the case when I started here. For those unfamiliar, Guides are horizontal and vertical lines that you can use to position your designs. Unlike our Layout Grids, Guides are a little faster to create and manipulate.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a29d1c9c764f5ecb38fba4194306bd1b7c573073-866x582.png?w=670&amp;h=450&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a29d1c9c764f5ecb38fba4194306bd1b7c573073-866x582.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a29d1c9c764f5ecb38fba4194306bd1b7c573073-866x582.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a29d1c9c764f5ecb38fba4194306bd1b7c573073-866x582.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a29d1c9c764f5ecb38fba4194306bd1b7c573073-866x582.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 866w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>To see Guides, enable the ruler view (main menu → view → show rulers). When you hover over the vertical or horizontal rulers (which are pinned at the top and side of the canvas), the offset number will appear and you can click it to create a Guide.</p><p>They appear as thin red lines and can be dragged to different offsets — you can also click multiple offsets on the ruler to populate several Guides at once. To remove Guides just select them and hit delete, or drag them off the screen. Guides will also disappear if you disable ruler view.</p><figure></figure><p>One fun feature: If you drag a Guide into a frame it becomes a frame level Guide. That lets you keep your canvas a little cleaner for those of you going Guide-wild. Guides only work on top-level frames, so if you drag a frame with Guides into a different frame, the Guides will disappear.</p><p>If you change a Guide’s position on the canvas by accident, you can undo the change with the command z shortcut. You can also nudge a Guide by pixels with arrows.</p><p>How do you feel about Figma Guides?

      <title>Meet the design pioneers taking on the venture world</title>

      <description>Soleio Cuervo and Adam Michela invest $12 million in design and marketing</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s practically a prerequisite for new VCs to trumpet their arrival on the scene with a Medium post and as much fanfare as they can muster. In an era when money flows freely, the self-promoters stand out.</p><p>The latest seed stage firm on the scene — <a href="https://combine.vc/">Combine</a> — took the opposite tact: They sent out a few cryptic tweets of their warehouse office and have published exactly zero follow up information in the six weeks that followed. An odd start for a venture fund in the age of non-stop thought leadership.</p><p>Those in the know had anticipated Combine’s quiet launch for months, and despite the lack of mainstream buzz, a subset of Silicon Valley was paying close attention. Something new was in motion, piloted by two pioneers of the 2nd wave of the tech design industry — <a href="https://twitter.com/soleio">Soleio Cuervo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/soopa">Adam Michela</a>. Soleio is one of <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>’s advisors, so we were able to coax the first on-the-record interview out of them.</p><p>As Facebook’s second ever design hire, Soleio helped shape the early culture at the social network and led the design of products that went on to touch billions — Facebook messenger, groups and the original Facebook like button. Adam joined Facebook as Soleio departed, and built out <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-so-many-product-design-teams-releasing-design-systems-these-days/answer/Adam-Michela">the social network’s first ever design system</a>, before leaving to do the same at Airbnb.</p><div><blockquote><p>If a VC firm launches without a Medium post, does it really exist?</p></blockquote></div><p>After wrapping up these storied careers of their own, they’re now inventing a new VC model that’s part early stage investment firm and part design studio. They’ve raised over $12 million to date for the first fund and plan to hire a small team of all-star design partners who will work with portfolio companies on everything from branding and marketing to user research and recruiting staff.</p><p>Think Andreessen-Horowitz, but hyper-focused on design and with a small, elite portfolio. It’s a new approach to venture, one that takes the “merchants of service” VC model to the extreme. If Combine succeeds, it could inspire a new style of seed stage investing.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a5d6a73c75ca80057baa4050ce15e7d5035ecf96-1180x890.png?rect=0,0,1180,889&amp;w=670&amp;h=505&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a5d6a73c75ca80057baa4050ce15e7d5035ecf96-1180x890.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a5d6a73c75ca80057baa4050ce15e7d5035ecf96-1180x890.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a5d6a73c75ca80057baa4050ce15e7d5035ecf96-1180x890.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a5d6a73c75ca80057baa4050ce15e7d5035ecf96-1180x890.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/a5d6a73c75ca80057baa4050ce15e7d5035ecf96-1180x890.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1180w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Soleio at work in 2006 with Phil Fung, one of Facebook’s earliest engineers</figcaption></figure><p>The two of them are a classic case of opposites attracting — where Soleio is prone to bursts of laughter that echo through their cavernous office, Adam reserves his quiet smiles. The former is the emotive connector, the latter a methodical pragmatist.</p><p>The missionary and the operator, a tale as old as time.</p><p>There’s a few things they share in common: A love of design, a passion for people and a reluctance to toot their own horn.</p><p>“I’m a big fan of that Henry Ford quote — you don’t build a reputation on what you’re going to do, you build a reputation on what you’ve done.” Soleio said, when I teased him about Combine’s lack of PR. “That’s our ethos.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fe0155b33e09b87ecdd2032709df7fdac424edd-1600x1202.jpg?rect=0,0,1600,1201&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fe0155b33e09b87ecdd2032709df7fdac424edd-1600x1202.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fe0155b33e09b87ecdd2032709df7fdac424edd-1600x1202.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fe0155b33e09b87ecdd2032709df7fdac424edd-1600x1202.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fe0155b33e09b87ecdd2032709df7fdac424edd-1600x1202.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9fe0155b33e09b87ecdd2032709df7fdac424edd-1600x1202.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Adam Michela (2nd to the left) &amp; friends at Facebook in 2012</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-designer-drought"><a href="#the-designer-drought">The designer drought</a></h2><p>Combine is launching at a pivotal time in the tech industry, as startups live or die by their user experience. These days software is cheap to build — thanks AWS — and consumers have a wide variety of choices. Companies’ best shot at building a deep moat around their business is through design.</p><p>“The difference today versus ten years ago is that if someone can’t figure out how to use something, they don’t blame themselves, they blame the service,” Facebook VP of Product Design, Julie Zhuo, told Figma.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f72beacd7a53c75f2cd647410adc1f781495398-1200x1799.jpg?rect=0,0,1200,1798&amp;w=670&amp;h=1004&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f72beacd7a53c75f2cd647410adc1f781495398-1200x1799.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f72beacd7a53c75f2cd647410adc1f781495398-1200x1799.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f72beacd7a53c75f2cd647410adc1f781495398-1200x1799.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f72beacd7a53c75f2cd647410adc1f781495398-1200x1799.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8f72beacd7a53c75f2cd647410adc1f781495398-1200x1799.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1200w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Techies have cottoned onto this and are hiring designers by the boatload, as we saw recently in the Kleiner Perkins Internet Trends report. Six major startups <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/31/here-are-some-reasons-behind-techs-design-shortage/">released data</a> showing they’d doubled (or more) their designer: engineer hiring ratio since 2012. In related news, a handful of big tech companies <a href="https://blog.figma.com/the-6-design-trends-john-maeda-predicted-in-his-state-of-the-union-da2b257168e1">snatched up 35 design firms</a> in the last few years to meet their need (data from John Maeda’s <a href="https://designintech.report/">Design in Tech report</a>).</p><p>There’s just not enough talent to go around. Graphic and art schools don’t train for tech, so the industry is in short supply of qualified candidates. In the recruitment wars, big companies compete aggressively for new hires by offering them far more resources and professional security.</p><p>Combine is uniquely suited to swing the pendulum back. Adam and Soleio can woo top tier designers to their portfolio companies by offering them the kind of mentorship and structure that most startups can’t provide on their own. They modeled this approach after the organizations they built at Facebook, Dropbox, and Airbnb, where designers in small product teams rely on the broader group for collaboration and support.</p><p>“Design is often something that the founders of today think about last,” said Adam. “But it’s one of the things that should be thought about first.”</p><h2 id="soleio-and-adam-s-rise-through-silicon-valley"><a href="#soleio-and-adam-s-rise-through-silicon-valley">Soleio and Adam’s rise through Silicon Valley</a></h2><p>The hiring challenge doesn’t daunt them in part because Adam and Soleio are two of the most influential recruiters in the Valley. Soleio’s skills were on full display in 2012, when he convinced tech designers en masse to join what was then a fledgling cloud storage company. “Dropbox was stacked with talent when he ran the design team,” <a href="https://twitter.com/uberbryn">Bryn Jackson</a>, creator of the <a href="https://spec.fm/podcasts/design-details">Design Details podcast</a>, said. “Everyone thought it was the team to work for.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/be1b37a19cbdd8228be98b0a4a20c5381ac15a1f-604x453.jpg?rect=0,0,603,453&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/be1b37a19cbdd8228be98b0a4a20c5381ac15a1f-604x453.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/be1b37a19cbdd8228be98b0a4a20c5381ac15a1f-604x453.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/be1b37a19cbdd8228be98b0a4a20c5381ac15a1f-604x453.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 603w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Anyone you ask about Soleio says he has a magic skill for convincing people to do things they wouldn’t otherwise, a talent he honed during his Facebook days. When it became clear the company was going to reach a hell of a lot more people than it ever dreamed, design needed to step up.</p><p>Along with building many of Facebook’s earliest products, Soleio assembled the so-called “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/05/how-facebook-designs-the-perfect-empty-vessel-for-your-mind/275426/">New York Yankees of design</a>,” a group of all-stars with talents far beyond the (back then) banal world of social media. He rallied this dream team by selling them on the impact of their work at scale.</p><p>“In the era of the smartphones a designer is able to influence the fabric of people’s lives in a way that was not possible before,” Soleio said. “The stakes feel a lot higher.”</p><p>Soleio and Adam met during their brief overlap at the big blue network. The two don’t remember much from their earliest interactions, but Adam grew fond of Soleio from afar as he started to build Facebook’s first system for designing across different platforms and products.</p><p>Facebook was in dire need of this standardization. By 2012, the company had hit its painful growth phase, and inefficiencies in the design process slowed the entire company.</p><p>“We were all designing things in a different way so everything took twice as long,” Adam said <a href="https://designdetails.simplecast.fm/105">during a podcast interview</a>. “Reviews with Zuck were painful.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3f80626994c2b5d5aafb5f3ac11dd5ee736b2380-705x435.png?w=670&amp;h=413&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3f80626994c2b5d5aafb5f3ac11dd5ee736b2380-705x435.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3f80626994c2b5d5aafb5f3ac11dd5ee736b2380-705x435.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3f80626994c2b5d5aafb5f3ac11dd5ee736b2380-705x435.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/3f80626994c2b5d5aafb5f3ac11dd5ee736b2380-705x435.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 705w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Adam combed through the company’s design standards from years prior to see what had already been tried. He found Soleio’s handiwork throughout it, and with enough sleuthing, he eventually figured out the missing piece: How to keep the design system from going out of date.</p><p>Years after building this at Facebook, he put the same knowledge to work on Airbnb’s Design Language System. Both became examples the rest of the tech industry has modeled to try new products and features at exponentially faster rates.</p><p>“Some designers want their fingerprints on everything,” said Mike Davidson, the former VP of Design at Twitter and an LP in Combine. “Adam is the other way around. He thinks the design system should be about the user.”</p><h2 id="no-fluffy-photo-filter-or-online-dating-apps-here"><a href="#no-fluffy-photo-filter-or-online-dating-apps-here">No fluffy photo filter or online dating apps here</a></h2><p>In terms of design star power, Adam and Soleio are the two you’d want in your corner.</p><p>“Soleio and Adam have, between them, worked at the spectrum of tech companies from big to small and everything in between,” Julie Zhuo said. “They’ve been at the center of the continuing evolution of design in tech.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0bf8039708f87899ebcdceb0d4f592abe3b58d08-1600x1064.jpg?rect=1,0,1598,1064&amp;w=670&amp;h=446&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0bf8039708f87899ebcdceb0d4f592abe3b58d08-1600x1064.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0bf8039708f87899ebcdceb0d4f592abe3b58d08-1600x1064.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0bf8039708f87899ebcdceb0d4f592abe3b58d08-1600x1064.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0bf8039708f87899ebcdceb0d4f592abe3b58d08-1600x1064.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0bf8039708f87899ebcdceb0d4f592abe3b58d08-1600x1064.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>They’re hoping that “operator as investor” appeal will attract companies to Combine in its current infancy. After all, they have yet to prove their thesis: Will early design influence improve a startup’s chance at success?</p><p>The star power of their early investor base — which includes many notable founders, design leaders, and tech executives — suggests there’s real promise. They count among their numbers Adam D’Angelo, the founder and CEO of Quora, and Evan Sharp, the co-founder of Pinterest, alongside Twitter’s Davidson and other undisclosed backers.</p><p>“Design is often the most important and most challenging part of making a new product successful,” said D’Angelo. “Combine’s studio model will give its portfolio companies a real competitive advantage.”</p><p>Adam and Soleio want to focus their attentions on companies tackling ambitious problems, but they’re not publicly disclosing their investments just yet.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8bda9d3622f9ad69364e4effce4be9c1ce8bd0e-1400x800.png?rect=0,0,1399,800&amp;w=670&amp;h=383&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8bda9d3622f9ad69364e4effce4be9c1ce8bd0e-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8bda9d3622f9ad69364e4effce4be9c1ce8bd0e-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8bda9d3622f9ad69364e4effce4be9c1ce8bd0e-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8bda9d3622f9ad69364e4effce4be9c1ce8bd0e-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e8bda9d3622f9ad69364e4effce4be9c1ce8bd0e-1400x800.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The day I came by Combine’s new office, the founder duo were poring over plans for customizable furniture. They’d asked their architects and interior designers — <a href="https://reddotstudio.com/">Red Dot Studio</a> and <a href="https://www.storeydesign.co/">Storey Design</a> — to invent movable, modular pieces, so they could adapt their space for different situations easily.</p><p>“You could turn this furniture into a company you know,” Adam told the architects.

      <description>design conference vectors</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a hot new tech design conference in town — <a href="https://2017.sfdesignweek.org/events/vectors-conference/">Vectors</a> — and it sold out in two days flat. I know what you’re thinking — the last thing San Francisco needs is another room full of badge wearing, Mac-toting nerds listening to “thought leaders” wax eloquent.</p><p>But Vectors is a far cry from the usual fodder.

      <title>WebAssembly cut Figma&#39;s load time by 3x</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-by-3x/</link>
      <description>Because our product is written in C++, which can easily be compiled into WebAssembly, Figma is a perfect demonstration of this new format’s power.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>WebAssembly was just <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2017/03/07/lots-new-in-firefox-game-changing-webassembly-support/">released this past March</a> but has already generated a lot of excitement in the web community. It’s a new binary format for machine code that was specifically designed with browsers in mind. Because apps compiled to WebAssembly can run as fast as native apps, it has the potential to change the way software is written on the web.</p><p>Many people have started experimenting with toy WebAssembly projects on the side, but it’s hard to tell what the real-world performance gains will be unless you have a large compatible code base for comparison. Because our product is written in C++, which can easily be compiled into WebAssembly, <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> is a perfect demonstration of this new format’s power. If you haven’t used Figma before, it’s a browser-based interface design tool with a powerful 2D WebGL rendering engine that supports very large documents.</p><p>We thought our findings would be useful to the web community as an example of WebAssembly’s impact. Spoiler: it’s much faster.</p><h2 id="overview-of-webassembly"><a href="#overview-of-webassembly">Overview of WebAssembly</a></h2><p>WebAssembly allows developers to create desktop-quality experiences on the web without compromising on performance. All major browsers are adding support for it and devoting significant resources to making it as fast as possible.</p><p>Before WebAssembly, C++ code could be run in the browser by cross-compiling it to a subset of JavaScript known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asm.js">asm.js</a>. The asm.js subset is basically JavaScript where you can only use numbers (no strings, objects, etc.). This is all you need to run C++ code since everything in C++ is either a number or a pointer to a number, and pointers are also numbers. The C++ address space is just a giant JavaScript array of numbers and pointers are just indices into that array.</p><p>WebAssembly is a drop-in replacement for asm.js that is more efficient in every way. But it still maps 1:1 with asm.js so it has the same limitations. Since it can only load and store numbers, it needs to call out to JavaScript code to do anything interesting (create DOM nodes, make network connections, etc.). WebAssembly code is still inside the browser sandbox and can only use the browser APIs that JavaScript has access to.</p><p>There are many benefits to running C++ code using WebAssembly instead of cross-compiling it to JavaScript:</p><ul><li>The format is very compact so it takes less time to transfer over the network than the equivalent cross-compiled JavaScript, even when compressed.</li><li>The format was designed to be as fast as possible for the browser to parse. This isn’t true for JavaScript syntax, which was designed for humans and contains lots of redundancy and extra rules that must be checked before it can be run. WebAssembly parses around <a href="https://webassembly.org/docs/rationale/#why-a-binary-encoding">20x faster</a> than asm.js.</li><li>C++ code is heavily optimized by the LLVM toolchain before it’s even encoded in WebAssembly. This means the browser can just translate it directly to native code without doing any optimizations. In contrast, browsers don’t skip optimizations for JavaScript code because it’s usually hand-written and needs many layers of optimizations to be fast.</li><li>It’s trivial for browsers to cache the translation of a WebAssembly module to native code. This means the second time you load a page using a WebAssembly module, there’s virtually no load time at all! This isn’t true for asm.js, which is mixed in with regular JavaScript and requires a complex verification pass to validate that it actually follows the asm.js restrictions.</li><li>WebAssembly has native support for 64-bit integers. JavaScript only has 64-bit floating-point numbers so it <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1848700/biggest-integer-that-can-be-stored-in-a-double">only supports 53-bit integers.</a> 64-bit integers have to be emulated in JavaScript, which can be much slower.</li></ul><p>If you’re interested in learning more about WebAssembly, I can recommend both Lin Clark’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HktWin_LPf4">high-level intro presentation</a> and a <a href="https://rsms.me/wasm-intro">low-level post</a> by Rasmus Andersson, a designer and engineer who works at Figma, which describes the WebAssembly format in excellent detail. The official docs have a <a href="https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/">getting started guide</a> if you’d like to play around with it yourself.</p><h2 id="webassembly-and-figma"><a href="#webassembly-and-figma">WebAssembly and Figma</a></h2><p>The biggest benefit we saw from using WebAssembly at Figma was faster load time. This isn’t surprising since one of WebAssembly’s primary goals is to reduce load time. When we measure load time at Figma we include the time to initialize our app, download the design file, and render the whole design for the first time.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6c35142a5d2e6229410619adaff3f7f811b6ef74-799x409.jpg?w=670&amp;h=343&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6c35142a5d2e6229410619adaff3f7f811b6ef74-799x409.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6c35142a5d2e6229410619adaff3f7f811b6ef74-799x409.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6c35142a5d2e6229410619adaff3f7f811b6ef74-799x409.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6c35142a5d2e6229410619adaff3f7f811b6ef74-799x409.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>As you can see, our load time improved by more than 3x after we switched to WebAssembly regardless of document size. This is a huge improvement for our users, who often create very large design documents and frequently switch between them.</p><p>An additional load time benefit of WebAssembly that isn’t captured in this graph is that load time no longer depends on application size. As long as users have loaded the app before, the browser should already have the translation from WebAssembly to native code cached from last time.</p><p>We were hoping that enabling WebAssembly would automatically improve download size too but it didn’t end up shrinking by much, especially after compression. It turns out that compressing asm.js code only ends up slightly bigger than compressing the equivalent WebAssembly code.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c676c6b86ea6c22cda85027ae4056430372c8ef-799x409.jpg?w=670&amp;h=343&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c676c6b86ea6c22cda85027ae4056430372c8ef-799x409.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c676c6b86ea6c22cda85027ae4056430372c8ef-799x409.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c676c6b86ea6c22cda85027ae4056430372c8ef-799x409.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/4c676c6b86ea6c22cda85027ae4056430372c8ef-799x409.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="webassembly-state-of-the-world"><a href="#webassembly-state-of-the-world">WebAssembly state of the world</a></h2><p>At the time of writing, WebAssembly support is only enabled by default in Firefox and Chrome. Edge and Safari are still working on their implementations and haven’t released them yet. This will probably change soon so you should check the <a href="https://caniuse.com/#search=wasm">“Can I use” entry</a> for the latest status.</p><p>Even though WebAssembly support is enabled in both Firefox and Chrome, <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> actually only uses WebAssembly in Firefox. We hit some showstopper bugs in Chrome’s WebAssembly implementation that are currently preventing us from enabling WebAssembly in Chrome:</p><ul><li><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=719172">Bug 719172</a>: Unlike Firefox, Chrome doesn’t cache its translated WebAssembly code. This means that the entire app must be re-translated every time the page loads, which actually makes our page load slower with WebAssembly than it does with asm.js.</li><li><a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=729768">Bug 729768</a>: Chrome’s WebAssembly implementation crashes sometimes when running Figma’s code. We’re assuming that this is a bug in V8 because the same code runs fine in Firefox.</li></ul><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that browser debugger support is still emerging. It wasn’t prioritized for the WebAssembly MVP and isn’t really implemented yet. We’re still compiling to asm.js instead of WebAssembly for debugging in the meantime.</p><h2 id="the-future-of-webassembly"><a href="#the-future-of-webassembly">The future of WebAssembly</a></h2><p>WebAssembly is brand new and so is understandably still rough around the edges. However, it’s a principled and practical approach to achieving native performance on the web that is well-poised to become core to how the web works.</p><p>One exciting aspect of WebAssembly is that it has much bigger ambitions than just being a target for C++ code. The design is appropriately general-purpose and it should be easy to add WebAssembly as an alternative output format for any compiler that targets native code. An official LLVM backend is in development that, when finished, will make it easy for any language using the LLVM toolchain to emit WebAssembly code directly.</p><p>WebAssembly also <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1079">has plans</a> to expose bindings to the JavaScript garbage collector at some point. That will make it much easier to cross-compile garbage-collected languages (Java, C#, etc.) to WebAssembly. You can read more about upcoming WebAssembly features <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/features#webassembly">here</a>.</p><p>Another compelling aspect of WebAssembly is that it’s an integrated part of the web platform. It’s natural and expected to create web apps that use both JavaScript and WebAssembly modules. For example, if you want universal JPEG 2000 support, you no longer have to wait for it to be supported in all browsers. Just cross-compile a decoder to WebAssembly and call it from JavaScript! It should be just as fast as if it were part of the browser itself.</p><p>This could potentially improve iteration time of the web platform. Browsers can focus on exposing low-level hardware primitives (WebGL, Bluetooth, USB, etc.) and leave the development of higher-level libraries to the community, which can evolve at a faster pace.</p><p>Even though WebAssembly isn’t quite ready yet, Figma is still investing in it because we believe that it’s an important part of the future of the web.</p><p><em>Like working on state-of-the-art web apps? <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">Come work at Figma!</a></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>ou’re never done designing — things are changing because you’re always getting fresh information</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The developer-designer handoff is an imperfect thing. In theory, a designer finishes a UI and sends it to the engineer to code, like a whistling baseball pitch that’s then bashed into the outfield. In reality, the process looks more like a volleyball game. Back and forth the files fly through the Interwebs as both parties cross their fingers they don’t accidentally work off an outdated document.</p><p>This was the experience of the design and engineering team at <a href="https://pivotal.io/">Pivotal</a>, the software and services company based out of San Francisco. Colby Sato, one of Pivotal’s Product Designers on their <a href="https://pivotal.io/platform">Platform</a> Monitoring team, would spend days managing the developer documentation on each project.</p><p>“You’re never done designing — things are always changing because you’re always getting fresh information,” Colby said.</p><h3 id="days-spent-on-dev-documentation"><a href="#days-spent-on-dev-documentation">Days spent on dev documentation</a></h3><p>To keep the engineers in the loop about design updates, Colby would export the design frames as images, then upload those images to engineering cards in <a href="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/">Pivotal Tracker</a> (Pivotal’s project management tool). That happened 15–20 times per project.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2db881cbe5718b10cd17e985611d3828a895bbaf-911x383.png?rect=1,0,910,383&amp;w=670&amp;h=282&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2db881cbe5718b10cd17e985611d3828a895bbaf-911x383.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2db881cbe5718b10cd17e985611d3828a895bbaf-911x383.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2db881cbe5718b10cd17e985611d3828a895bbaf-911x383.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2db881cbe5718b10cd17e985611d3828a895bbaf-911x383.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 910w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The engineers’ used hundreds of cards for each project, so Colby would have to spend hours searching for the right cards. Sometimes, he would occasionally forget to update an image and engineers would work off the wrong file.</p><p>“It loses time for the developer and it’s embarrassing,” Colby said.</p><h3 id="the-figma-way"><a href="#the-figma-way">The Figma way</a></h3><p>Then Colby’s manager introduced him to our tool, Figma. We’re a lot like Google Docs for design.</p><p>Colby loves the fact that his Figma design files are in the browser, which means they’re always up to date, accessible from any computer, and shareable with a link (no software downloads necessary). The tool also has a commenting function for explaining how frames are supposed to function.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/22465f5bd751a206be9749baad90a22e0c75e25c-1200x676.png?rect=0,0,1200,675&amp;w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/22465f5bd751a206be9749baad90a22e0c75e25c-1200x676.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/22465f5bd751a206be9749baad90a22e0c75e25c-1200x676.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/22465f5bd751a206be9749baad90a22e0c75e25c-1200x676.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/22465f5bd751a206be9749baad90a22e0c75e25c-1200x676.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/22465f5bd751a206be9749baad90a22e0c75e25c-1200x676.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1200w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>“It’s not just a design tool — it’s a design management tool in a way,” Colby said.</p><p>Once Colby used Figma, he no longer had to update the developer cards when designs changed — he just made sure to include the Figma link when the card was first created.</p><p>“I don’t need to worry about the engineers going to the right file, I know they will,” Colby said. “It easily saves me two days of work per project.”</p><p>Figma also helped shorten Pivotal’s design reviews and make them more effective, according to Colby. At the company, engineers take part in design critiques weekly. They used to write down their notes on post-its and share aloud one-by-one, a slow, laborious process.</p><p>“Post-it notes are without context — they’re like floating ideas,” Colby said. “People reading theirs out will drone on. But with Figma we can understand them better because the notes are attached to the design itself.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d5545f70ffe00ecc85cf0c93931886770e5292f5-1600x939.png?w=670&amp;h=393&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d5545f70ffe00ecc85cf0c93931886770e5292f5-1600x939.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d5545f70ffe00ecc85cf0c93931886770e5292f5-1600x939.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d5545f70ffe00ecc85cf0c93931886770e5292f5-1600x939.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d5545f70ffe00ecc85cf0c93931886770e5292f5-1600x939.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d5545f70ffe00ecc85cf0c93931886770e5292f5-1600x939.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>While engineers reviewed the design, Colby could watch everyone’s activity in the file, following their cursors around. If developers focused on a part of the design Colby didn’t need help on — like a component that’s set by Pivotal’s style guide — he could prompt them in the right direction.</p><p>“It gives the person receiving the critique more control over what they want feedback on,” Colby said.</p><p>Ultimately, Figma eased the developer to designer hand off and sped up the design critiques. That made it easier for Colby to work with his counterparts at Pivotal. It gave them more time to focus on the quality of the work itself, instead of the logistics of tracking updates and feedback.</p><p>“At Pivotal, we feel like a team that has input from everyone in developing a product is going to build a better product,” Colby said. “Figma enables that.”</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="aTmyYdRyt3RJ" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em>You can read more about how Pivotal approaches building great user experiences by reading <a href="https://builttoadapt.io/design/home">the Design section of Built to Adapt</a>, Pivotal’s publication on Medium.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>In Figma, constraints allow you to fix elements of your design to different sides of their parent frame.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e366de4a66cd73fa56802995e7c6eede595ed1c1-2400x1256.png?rect=1,0,2398,1256&amp;w=693&amp;h=363&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e366de4a66cd73fa56802995e7c6eede595ed1c1-2400x1256.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 347w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e366de4a66cd73fa56802995e7c6eede595ed1c1-2400x1256.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 520w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e366de4a66cd73fa56802995e7c6eede595ed1c1-2400x1256.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 693w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e366de4a66cd73fa56802995e7c6eede595ed1c1-2400x1256.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1040w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e366de4a66cd73fa56802995e7c6eede595ed1c1-2400x1256.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1386w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Remember the good ‘ol era of tech design, when you had to create interfaces — at most — for a PC and a Mac? Me neither. That universe seems light years away in today’s screen-addicted world.</p><p>Designers’ jobs have grown exponentially harder with the introduction of mobile phones and tablets. You’re designing for endless adaptations and contexts, a never-ending <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Sisyphean">Sisyphean</a> task.</p><p>We feel your pain at Figma, which is why we built our tool with a powerful constraints feature. It allows you to fix elements of your design to different sides of their parent frame. If you set your constraints correctly, your design will scale to fit any screen size.</p><p>You can find them here, in the righthand properties panel when you select a frame:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/29de7b6dd856f764e1057ea1ab59133bd6b7a7ff-1552x921.png?rect=0,0,1552,920&amp;w=693&amp;h=411&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/29de7b6dd856f764e1057ea1ab59133bd6b7a7ff-1552x921.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 347w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/29de7b6dd856f764e1057ea1ab59133bd6b7a7ff-1552x921.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 520w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/29de7b6dd856f764e1057ea1ab59133bd6b7a7ff-1552x921.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 693w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/29de7b6dd856f764e1057ea1ab59133bd6b7a7ff-1552x921.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1040w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/29de7b6dd856f764e1057ea1ab59133bd6b7a7ff-1552x921.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1386w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Constraints are amazing, but they take a little getting used to. In Figma, we let you fix objects to the left, right, top, bottom, center, scale, left &amp; right, or top &amp; bottom. You can play around with a simple button in a frame to see how objects react to different types of constraints.</p><figure></figure><p>Need help figuring out how to put them into practice? We collected five ways constraints can make your life a lot easier, ranging from beginner level to intermediate.</p><h3 id="_1-pinning-a-button-in-the-corner"><a href="#_1-pinning-a-button-in-the-corner">1) Pinning a button in the corner</a></h3><p>A lot of mobile UIs have action buttons situated in the same place every time. For example, Google’s Material Design Guidelines favor a bottom right hand button (also known as a FAB) that encourages the user to take an action.</p><p>With <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/54-constraints">Constraints</a>, you can set that button to the bottom and right hand corner of its parent frame. That ensures the button doesn’t float around the screen when the screen size expands — it stays exactly where you want it.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="_2-the-magic-of-components-constraints"><a href="#_2-the-magic-of-components-constraints">2) The magic of components + constraints</a></h3><p>You can work some fun design magic by using Figma’s components feature in connection with grids. Components (which other applications call symbols) allow you to turn parts of your design into repeating, mirrored instances. When you make changes to the original, the changes are reflected anywhere else you used that component. (You can <a href="https://blog.figma.com/components-in-figma-e7e80fcf6fd2">read more about components here</a>.)</p><p>Now, to add constraints to this: Once you’ve constrained the key parts of your design to the sides of the frame, turn the frame into a component. Duplicate the frame for multiple screen sizes. Now, when you change attributes of the original, like color or text size, you can immediately see them reflected in different screen sizes.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="_3-the-magic-of-constraints-grids"><a href="#_3-the-magic-of-constraints-grids">3) The magic of constraints + grids</a></h3><p>Alright, buckle in because we’re getting a little more advanced. With Figma, you can use constraints to snap objects to a grid. This is particularly handy for something like a navigation bar at the bottom of an app.</p><p>To make a flexible nav-bar in Figma, create the frame that serves as the phone screen then nest the nav-bar frame at the bottom of the screen.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1b4296b306e6b31ccd67c5eae3b76307e00953d4-1600x900.png?rect=0,0,1599,900&amp;w=693&amp;h=390&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1b4296b306e6b31ccd67c5eae3b76307e00953d4-1600x900.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 347w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1b4296b306e6b31ccd67c5eae3b76307e00953d4-1600x900.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 520w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1b4296b306e6b31ccd67c5eae3b76307e00953d4-1600x900.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 693w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1b4296b306e6b31ccd67c5eae3b76307e00953d4-1600x900.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1040w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/1b4296b306e6b31ccd67c5eae3b76307e00953d4-1600x900.png?w=693&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1386w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Set the nav-bar constraints to left &amp; right, and bottom. With that nav-bar frame still selected, choose a layout grid from the right-hand properties panel and set the type to “stretch”.</p><p>Then, place an object — like a circular button — inside each grid column. Set the constraints on each button to be centered. When the screen size changes, your buttons will adapt accordingly. For an even deeper dive into grids, <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/grid-systems-for-screen-design/">check out this post</a>.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="_4-table-cells"><a href="#_4-table-cells">4) Table cells</a></h3><p>You can use constraints to make reusable table cells designs that are flexible. Designers often need table cells to present lists of people or information, and adding constraints to the basic cell makes it easier to adapt. For example, I grouped text and an avatar together (by pressing control g), and constrained that to the center left of the frame. I then grouped text and a rectangle with rounded corners together into a button and constrained that to the center right of the frame.</p><p>As you can see, the component now reacts as you’d hope it would, with each piece of information hugging the side of the frame where it belongs, regardless of frame size.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="_5-illustrations"><a href="#_5-illustrations">5) Illustrations</a></h3><p>Lastly, we figured we’d throw in a fun constraints example just for kicks. You can put horizontal or vertical constraints on illustrations or drawings to add an extra bit of humor. You can turn a hot dog into a slinky version of itself, or turn a dog that looks like a hot dog into even more of one. We played around with it for one of our designer’s recent birthdays at Figma.</p><figure></figure><p>Learn more about the <a href="https://help.figma.com/article/54-constraints">ins and out of Constraints</a> in our Help Center.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>How Braintree Cut Time Spent on Design Critiques by 50%</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/how-braintree-cut-time-spent-on-design-critiques-by-50/</link>
      <description>We talked to the team to hear how Figma streamlined the process</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most design critiques are inefficient, lumbering beasts. A designer presents their work, receiving an avalanche of feedback. They then return to their computer and toil away in solitude. Another meeting is scheduled, where the designer and reviewers realize the feedback was miscommunicated, or the design didn’t work as well as expected, or that new issues cropped up with the change.</p><p>The solo designer returns to their computer to keep chipping away. And so on marches the cycle of death. It strips the creativity from the process, and it’s not particularly efficient either.</p><p>Designers at the <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/">payments processing company Braintree</a> wanted to find another way. When PayPal acquired Braintree a few years ago, there were multiple design teams that began working on different interfaces across each organization. As you can imagine, that ratcheted up the complexity of the process — designers were working with two different style guides, a myriad of services, and developers from a bunch of teams.</p><h3 id="finding-figma"><a href="#finding-figma">Finding Figma</a></h3><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/03f1443fd74870617cd651d998c76c806935cc78-1600x1066.png?rect=0,0,1600,1065&amp;w=670&amp;h=446&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/03f1443fd74870617cd651d998c76c806935cc78-1600x1066.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/03f1443fd74870617cd651d998c76c806935cc78-1600x1066.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/03f1443fd74870617cd651d998c76c806935cc78-1600x1066.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/03f1443fd74870617cd651d998c76c806935cc78-1600x1066.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/03f1443fd74870617cd651d998c76c806935cc78-1600x1066.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Braintree needed effective design critiques more than ever, so one group decided to experiment with new ways of giving feedback. Over coffee in the company’s cozy, wood paneled office, we spoke about their process with Craig Wattrus, a Braintree designer who works on the three person Developer Experience design team. This specific group creates the documentation that shows engineers how to integrate Braintree payments into their own services.</p><p>When Craig’s team started testing new critique methods, he suggested <a href="https://www.figma.com">Figma</a> — a tool that’s like Google Docs for design. It allows people to collaborate in design files and share them with a browser link. “I was first attracted to it because it was online and I could use it on my Windows computer at home,” Craig explained. “Now I just think it’s better.”</p><p>He says the nature of their design critiques changed overnight with Figma. Rather than setting up several in-person meetings, two Braintree designers would get on an audio Slack call and jump in the file together. Using Figma’s observation mode — where you click the icon of the other person in the file — Craig’s design partner Shannon Miwa was able to follow along on the screen as he showed her different frames.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/17e6e5088eb6b3c139b4c39c3c44c2c05105bc5f-1761x1061.png?rect=1,0,1760,1061&amp;w=670&amp;h=404&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/17e6e5088eb6b3c139b4c39c3c44c2c05105bc5f-1761x1061.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/17e6e5088eb6b3c139b4c39c3c44c2c05105bc5f-1761x1061.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/17e6e5088eb6b3c139b4c39c3c44c2c05105bc5f-1761x1061.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/17e6e5088eb6b3c139b4c39c3c44c2c05105bc5f-1761x1061.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/17e6e5088eb6b3c139b4c39c3c44c2c05105bc5f-1761x1061.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Creative collaboration instead of static critiques<br/>“We started really enjoying that as a process,” Craig said. “You get a lot of those moments where everything starts making sense.” He wouldn’t have to scribble down Shannon’s feedback and try to apply it after the meeting. Instead, Shannon was able to duplicate Craig’s artboard in front of him and make fast changes to show what she meant.</p><div><blockquote><p>“I was first attracted to it because it was online and I could use it on my Windows computer at home,” Craig explained. “Now I just think it’s better.”</p><p>The design critiques on Braintree’s developer team quickly evolved into more collaborative work sessions. The designers would each riff off each other, each brainstorming in the same file and peeking at each other’s work for inspiration. Sometimes, one person would start working on a third version, combining the best elements from each of their designs.</p></blockquote></div><p>“Every time it’s happened we’ve come to a much better place than if I’d just done it myself,” Craig said.</p><p>He estimates that using Figma cut down the time the team had to spend in design critiques by 50 percent. “The other person gets their point across really quickly,” he said. “Otherwise, I’d have to do the work and send it to Shannon later and say, ‘Is this what you were thinking?’”</p><figure></figure><h3 id="easing-the-dev-hand-off"><a href="#easing-the-dev-hand-off">Easing the dev hand-off</a></h3><p>It didn’t just make critiques more efficient. According to Craig, Figma also eliminated the need for the hundreds of messages the team used to send developers over the course of a big project. Instead of constantly re-exporting files whenever there was a change, the designers could send the engineers a link once.</p><p>“If the developer wanted to know what the filter button does, while she’s watching in the file I can say, ‘Oh this is how it works’ and duplicate the artboard in front of her eyes,” Craig said. “It lets you give them an answer as quickly as possible.” For the most part, the developers and designers stopped scheduling meetings to go over how the designs were supposed to function.</p><div><blockquote><p>“Every time it’s happened we’ve come to a much better place than if I’d just done it myself.”</p></blockquote></div><p>As tech companies expand, there’s more need than ever for clear, efficient lines of communication between members of a design team. For the Braintree design team, creating together in a real-time, online file was the solution.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Reflecting on Figma’s First Year</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/reflecting-on-figmas-first-year/</link>
      <description>When we set out to make a web-based design platform in the browser, we knew it wouldn’t be easy.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When we set out to make a web-based design platform in the browser, we knew it wouldn’t be easy. We faced not only the technical hurdle of rendering complex graphics while maintaining performance, but also the cultural challenge of convincing designers they could trust us. There are a lot of reasons no one successfully built a product like this before now.</p><p>In our early days, many labeled Figma a toy instead of a real tool. We had to prove our commitment to collaborative design, and we’ve worked hard to do so over the past year, talking to designers, engineers and product managers to understand the needs of scaling teams.</p><p>We shipped countless new features and updates, both big and small, to simplify workflows and make the tool feel more polished. In recent months, we made performance a major priority, investing significant engineering resources to speed up file loading and rendering. We’re constantly honing our Sketch import tool, which allows users to bring in their existing Sketch designs so they’re not starting from scratch.</p><p>We’ve been shipping so quickly users have told us it’s hard to keep track of all the developments. So, to celebrate our anniversary we gathered them here in one place for anyone who wants to see how Figma has evolved since launch. This is only the beginning…we have many exciting things in store for our users in the second year (keep an eye on our Twitter next week for starters 😉).</p><h2 id="collaborative-design"><a href="#collaborative-design">Collaborative design</a></h2><p><strong>Multiplayer editing, Sept. 28, 2016</strong></p><figure></figure><p>When we launched Figma to the public, we generated major debate among designers. Before us, no design tool ever offered multiplayer functionality. While some people were thrilled and promptly threw multiplayer design parties, others loathed the idea of working on a design at the same time as another person (the so-called “pair design” process).</p><p>One year in, we’ve seen people pair design in Figma to ship products on insane deadlines, mentor aspiring designers from around the world and run far more efficient design critiques.</p><p>But like its name, multiplayer has multiple benefits and the biggest one has nothing to do with collaborative design. Instead, its super power is that it gives teams a single source of truth. With Figma, designs can be shared with whomever needs them via a simple URL; as designs are updated or changed, the URL stays the same, abolishing the complex workflow previously required for syncing design assets and ensuring everyone on a product team is working with the latest file.</p><p>Copywriters can play with different messaging directly in the design, developers can grab attributes to convert designs to code and product managers can track project statuses without sending a single Slack message. No one accidentally saves over the design or works off an outdated version.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b625819b0eb42fadc9bad07764edc6aeceb3c076-800x839.png?w=670&amp;h=703&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b625819b0eb42fadc9bad07764edc6aeceb3c076-800x839.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b625819b0eb42fadc9bad07764edc6aeceb3c076-800x839.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b625819b0eb42fadc9bad07764edc6aeceb3c076-800x839.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b625819b0eb42fadc9bad07764edc6aeceb3c076-800x839.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="building-design-systems"><a href="#building-design-systems">Building design systems</a></h2><p><strong>Components, Dec. 8, 2016</strong><br/>As design becomes more and more important in the product process, companies require ways to systematize their design process at scale. In particular, they need to be able to synchronize components of their product — like status bars or navigation menus — across files and between team members. That way, designers don’t have to waste time manually updating all their designs whenever an icon is tweaked or a font is changed.</p><figure></figure><p>Design systems are a priority at Figma, and just a few months after launching to the public we released a feature to let designers synchronize components in individual files. We were excited to introduce component overrides, which allow designers to change any property of an individual instance, like the color or text font, without breaking the instance entirely.</p><div><blockquote><p>Component overrides allow designers to change any property of an individual instance, like the color or text font.</p></blockquote></div><p>This gave designers more flexibility, while still offering them the benefit of the broader design system.</p><h3 id="team-library-beta-feb-15-2017"><a href="#team-library-beta-feb-15-2017">Team Library beta, Feb. 15, 2017</a></h3><p>But sharing components locally didn’t go far enough, so in February we launched a first of its kind feature in beta called Team Library. This allowed designers to use synchronized components across files and share them with colleagues.</p><p>If a company updated its icon or tweaked its menu bar interface, the designer could make the change in one place and rest easy knowing it would immediately be mirrored in all the rest of the designs through the rest of their design system.</p><h3 id="team-library-1-0-sept-19-2017"><a href="#team-library-1-0-sept-19-2017">Team Library 1.0, Sept. 19, 2017</a></h3><p>We paid close attention to how people used Team Library beta so we could perfect it. We learned a lot over the last 8 months and we unveiled Team Library 1.0 with far more options for browsing and organizing components, publishing them, and documenting their functionality. A lot went out in this release, and in my personal opinion it’s one of the most exciting areas of Figma, so be sure to read up on how to create a design system for your team!</p><h2 id="working-with-non-designers"><a href="#working-with-non-designers">Working with non-designers</a></h2><p>We initially launched Figma with the individual designer in mind, but we always knew we would evolve into a broader platform. Design is inherently collaborative, and teams need far more efficient ways to communicate and work together.</p><p>Since we’re the only design application that runs on the web, we’re able to consolidate entire toolchains. With Figma, companies don’t have to glue different products together to meet their needs. The design application is also the prototyping application, file sharing application and developer handoff application. All of this comes together for the price of one.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2ac6f135af4810920f1ab268582c43059fc20741-800x610.png?w=670&amp;h=511&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2ac6f135af4810920f1ab268582c43059fc20741-800x610.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2ac6f135af4810920f1ab268582c43059fc20741-800x610.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2ac6f135af4810920f1ab268582c43059fc20741-800x610.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2ac6f135af4810920f1ab268582c43059fc20741-800x610.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="developer-handoff-july-25-2017"><a href="#developer-handoff-july-25-2017">Developer handoff, July 25, 2017</a></h3><p>With our code mode, developers can see the attributes they need to start coding a design. They can access code mode even if they only have view-only permission, so teams don’t have to pay for extra editor seats. Most importantly: Developers always know their implementation is based on the source of truth. The days where developers accidentally build an outdated design are gone.</p><h3 id="prototyping-july-25-2017"><a href="#prototyping-july-25-2017">Prototyping, July 25, 2017</a></h3><p>Figma may have started out as a design solution, but we expanded our repertoire with our prototyping feature. Before we launched it, our users were trapped in a hellish cycle — exporting designs whenever they made tweaks, using crazy naming conventions to keep frames in order, and syncing to multiple services to keep prototypes current.</p><p>We knew we could stop the madness with our web functionality. Figma prototypes let people design and prototype in one place — no need to hack together a bunch of third party tools. Just like with our code mode, our prototypes are always up to date, no syncing necessary.</p><h3 id="embed-integration-with-jira-trello-and-dropbox"><a href="#embed-integration-with-jira-trello-and-dropbox">Embed integration with JIRA, Trello and Dropbox Paper</a></h3><p>In the first phase of Figma, we focused on enabling people to design better products together. For our next act, we’re helping teams integrate design through their entire product workflow. We took the first step in this process by teaming up with Dropbox Paper, JIRA and Trello. Our Live Embed feature allowed teams to insert live, always up to date designs and prototypes in these project management tools.</p><h3 id="live-embed-kit-sept-28-2017"><a href="#live-embed-kit-sept-28-2017">Live Embed Kit, Sept. 28, 2017</a></h3><p>Live, always up to date designs have the potential to be useful in many places. Following on the heels of our first integrations, we created a simple Figma iframe that could be used by anyone to embed Figma designs and prototypes in any website or tool.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/001ec0c3a9e9e58f14c8b3acb8aedea69a6096a1-800x923.png?w=670&amp;h=773&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/001ec0c3a9e9e58f14c8b3acb8aedea69a6096a1-800x923.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/001ec0c3a9e9e58f14c8b3acb8aedea69a6096a1-800x923.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/001ec0c3a9e9e58f14c8b3acb8aedea69a6096a1-800x923.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/001ec0c3a9e9e58f14c8b3acb8aedea69a6096a1-800x923.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="design-functionality"><a href="#design-functionality">Design functionality</a></h2><h3 id="guides-june-26-2017"><a href="#guides-june-26-2017">Guides, June 26, 2017</a></h3><p>Guides made it easier for people to align designs visually, without having to set up a grid. They were a big crowd pleaser.</p><h3 id="photo-filters-july-20-2017"><a href="#photo-filters-july-20-2017">Photo filters, July 20, 2017</a></h3><p>Little known fact — we originally conceived Figma as a photo editing tool. We returned to these roots in a small way with our image filter toolbar. It lets designers make quick adjustments in exposure, contrast, saturation, temperature, tint, highlights and shadows.</p><h3 id="image-scaling-feb-8-2017"><a href="#image-scaling-feb-8-2017">Image scaling, Feb 8, 2017</a></h3><p>We introduced an array of options for designers scaling images — Fit, Fill, Stretch/Crop, and Tile.</p><h3 id="emojis-aug-10-2017"><a href="#emojis-aug-10-2017">Emojis, Aug. 10, 2017</a></h3><p>Emojis. Serious business folks. Our customers asked us for emoji integration for ages. These little faces are the language of emotion on the web, so we enabled them to appear both inside Figma designs and in comments.</p><h3 id="opentype-may-25-2017"><a href="#opentype-may-25-2017">OpenType, May 25, 2017</a></h3><p>We added a bunch of OpenType features — discretionary and historical ligatures, fractions, small caps, subscript and superscript.</p><h3 id="figma-mirror-for-android-may-9-2017"><a href="#figma-mirror-for-android-may-9-2017">Figma Mirror for Android, May 9, 2017</a></h3><p>This feature stirred more excitement than we’d expected. Designers were thrilled to be able to test their Android design appearance in actual Android hardware. As far as we know, we’re the only design tool to offer this.</p><h2 id="design-refresh"><a href="#design-refresh">Design refresh</a></h2><h3 id="logo-and-website"><a href="#logo-and-website">Logo and website</a></h3><p>Figma has matured a lot from its earliest stealth iterations. With a new era, we needed a fresh look and our design team embarked on a major communications and branding redesign. We jazzed up our website and introduced a new identity based on three principles: celebrating the fundamentals of design, encouraging play and design as a system.</p><h2 id="looking-forward"><a href="#looking-forward">Looking forward</a></h2><p>It’s been a busy year for us at Figma, but we’re only just getting started. We have a lot of exciting things in store for the next year that will make it easier for you to design and collaborate with your team. Keep watching to see what’s next!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You know the drill: You set up another form of identity verification, so if your login credentials get compromised your account is still safe.</p><p>To enable 2FA on your account, go to your account settings page from the drop-down menu on the top left corner of the application window. You’ll have the option of receiving a login code either via SMS or through an app like Google Authenticator. The system works with all mobile phones.</p><p>Your account settings page will also include recovery codes for 2FA authorization in the event you lose your phone (obviously, you should write those down before that happens though 😬).</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/37f084beb3d327cac906a1f8a13cc377050f053e-1866x1172.png?rect=0,0,1865,1172&amp;w=670&amp;h=421&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/37f084beb3d327cac906a1f8a13cc377050f053e-1866x1172.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/37f084beb3d327cac906a1f8a13cc377050f053e-1866x1172.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/37f084beb3d327cac906a1f8a13cc377050f053e-1866x1172.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/37f084beb3d327cac906a1f8a13cc377050f053e-1866x1172.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/37f084beb3d327cac906a1f8a13cc377050f053e-1866x1172.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>From then on, you’ll be prompted by 2FA every time you log out of the app and try to get back in, or when you log in using a new device. Once you’re logged in, the validation will last for 21 days before you’ll be prompted again.</p><p>We have additional security features coming down the pipeline soon, so stay tuned.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Are hackathons the answer to the tech designer shortage?</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/are-hackathons-the-answer-to-the-tech-designer-shortage/</link>
      <description>At first glance, hackathons seem like no place for design.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At first glance, hackathons seem like no place for design. They’re 24 hour melees packed with Red Bull chugging programmers who skip showers and sleep to impress corporate sponsors and their own comrades. But there’s a major <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/bob-baxley-on-apple-and-pinterest-company-cultures-and-the-designer-shortage-2">designer shortage</a> in Silicon Valley, and hackathons have all the makings to help design students get into tech life.</p><p>Chance to work with engineers?

Check.</p><p>In theory, hackathons could be the perfect funnel for recruiting designers to the dark side, except for one problem: Designers don’t think they belong there.</p><p>One college hackathon is trying to change that. <a href="https://2016.hackatbrown.org/">Hack@Brown</a>, which is Brown University’s annual event with 500 people, has spent the last few years wooing designers to attend. It’s slowly becoming known as a haven for art students, and tech companies like Facebook and Kayak have started attending to mentor and recruit budding designers.</p><h2 id="fighting-an-uphill-battle"><a href="#fighting-an-uphill-battle">Fighting an uphill battle</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e667881f408d1551990e10d820bd7c9c6accc604-2000x1333.jpg?rect=1,0,1998,1333&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e667881f408d1551990e10d820bd7c9c6accc604-2000x1333.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e667881f408d1551990e10d820bd7c9c6accc604-2000x1333.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e667881f408d1551990e10d820bd7c9c6accc604-2000x1333.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e667881f408d1551990e10d820bd7c9c6accc604-2000x1333.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e667881f408d1551990e10d820bd7c9c6accc604-2000x1333.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>“If you’re a designer and you want to work in tech why haven’t you done a hackathon?” said Jonathan Arena, a Facebook employee who came to Hack@Brown this year. “It’s going to teach you a lot about yourself and we love to see it.”</p><p>Hack@Brown provides a model for hackathons that want to convince designers to attend — it takes a totally different approach than standard hacker fare. (At Figma, we constantly hear from organizers who are struggling to do so.)</p><p>“Interacting with Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) students, a lot of them were confused like ‘Oh I can’t code,’” said Atty Eleti, a former Hack@Brown organizer. “The prevailing attitude among many students is that working at a tech company is like selling out.”</p><p>To change their minds, the hackathon team redid all their branding so it looked more appealing and professional. They created specific hackathon prizes for UX and UI. They even went so far as to message design clubs around the country and pay for the students’ round-trip tickets to Providence.</p><p>“Last year there were four of us [designers] on the team and this year there’s six,” said Zachary Deocadiz, a recent graduate from RISD who’s a Hack@Brown design lead. “We’re making sure there’s more designers bringing these issues up.”</p><h2 id="the-invisible-path-to-silicon-valley"><a href="#the-invisible-path-to-silicon-valley">The invisible path to Silicon Valley</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/64a23a113b78bf55cb84da55754e6ff895a797ae-2000x894.png?rect=0,0,2000,893&amp;w=670&amp;h=299&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/64a23a113b78bf55cb84da55754e6ff895a797ae-2000x894.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/64a23a113b78bf55cb84da55754e6ff895a797ae-2000x894.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/64a23a113b78bf55cb84da55754e6ff895a797ae-2000x894.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/64a23a113b78bf55cb84da55754e6ff895a797ae-2000x894.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/64a23a113b78bf55cb84da55754e6ff895a797ae-2000x894.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Still, no step was a silver bullet. One designer the organizers invited left as soon as she saw the recruiting stands for engineers. She felt like she didn’t fit in at an event traditionally targeted at developers.</p><p>This is perhaps a microcosm of the designer shortage in tech. Although clear paths have been established for wannabe engineers to learn the skills and find jobs, there’s no such trodden road for designers. The industry hasn’t done a good job of seeking them out.</p><p>“The onus is on companies to take the first step and send designers to hackathons,” Facebook’s Jonathan said. “Are you a product designer? Could you be? We gotta go to hackathons and find out where these people are.”</p><p>Former Hack@Brown organizer Atty thought he wanted to be an engineer until a chance Hack@Brown encounter drew him to design. His freshman year of college he met Figma engineer Jessica Liu. She introduced him to the inimitable <a href="https://twitter.com/byalicelee">Alice Lee</a>, who was a designer at Dropbox at the time.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b42cbf2b4cca13317e3bb42acc42d47fcb126eed-2000x569.png?rect=2,0,1996,569&amp;w=670&amp;h=191&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b42cbf2b4cca13317e3bb42acc42d47fcb126eed-2000x569.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b42cbf2b4cca13317e3bb42acc42d47fcb126eed-2000x569.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b42cbf2b4cca13317e3bb42acc42d47fcb126eed-2000x569.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b42cbf2b4cca13317e3bb42acc42d47fcb126eed-2000x569.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/b42cbf2b4cca13317e3bb42acc42d47fcb126eed-2000x569.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>“Alice was the first to say ‘I see potential in you. You could be a designer,’” Atty remembers. “That’s where my story of becoming a designer took shape.”</p><h2 id="the-hackathon-funnel"><a href="#the-hackathon-funnel">The hackathon funnel</a></h2><p>It may have been an uphill battle, but over the years, the Hack@Brown team has seen major success. They went from 15–20 designers at the first hackathon in 2013 to over 100 designers — 20 percent of attendees — in 2017. Hackathons across the country are following suit, trying to incorporate designers into their events.</p><p>The timing couldn’t be better as tech companies ramp up their hiring. Through Figma’s network, we’ve heard that Facebook’s designer recruitment goals are north of 800 this year (compared to 200 a few years ago).</p><p>“It’s really hard to find designers with the three core skill sets we look for just because it’s such a new field,” said Julyanne Liang, another Facebook designer who went to Hack@Brown. “We wanted to meet students we thought had potential.” The team had follow up calls with a lot of the attendees, two of whom toured the social network’s campus.</p><p>Facebook’s not the only one hiring up a storm. We’ve also heard that places like LinkedIn and Dropbox have increased their target designer hiring ratio to one for every four or five engineers. Major corporations like IBM and GE are publicly going on designer hiring sprees.</p><p>“Everyone who was at that hackathon, there was a pervasive anxiety around getting into tech and product design,” Jonathan said. “But I could see — there’s so much opportunity for them.”</p><p><strong>Like this story?

      <title>This website shows that to find talented female designers, you just need to look</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/this-website-shows-that-to-find-talented-female-designers-you-just-need-to/</link>
      <description>Now, there’s a website highlighting women in tech design.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s no secret that talented women in tech often don’t get as much attention as their male counterparts.</p><p>A Mic reporter, tired of the bullshit, recently made her <a href="https://mic.com/articles/175136/women-in-tech-1000-names-no-more-all-male-panels-conferences#.GZAFpVeHx">own list of 1,000 qualified women in tech.</a> In 2015, a Medium post collecting different groups of <a href="https://medium.com/ladies-storm-hackathons/finding-female-angel-and-early-stage-investors-in-tech-a67c998e2e9f">venture capital investors</a> who are women was also making the rounds. These lists aren’t exactly a cure-all for gender discrimination in Silicon Valley, but they prove there’s plenty of women in tech to at least follow on <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/elon-musk-follows-one-woman-caity-weaver-on-twitter">Twitter</a> (::cough:: Elon ::cough::).</p><p>Now, there’s a website highlighting women in tech design. <a href="https://twitter.com/julesforrest">Jules Forrest</a>, Product Designer at the venture capital firm Sequoia, has gathered names from people in the industry and compiled them into a <a href="https://womenwho.design/">easily perusable website.</a> People can filter the list by different categories, like “founder” or “UX research.” As we start recruiting more designers at Figma, we’re looking through the site ourselves.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6c7038e10ba17893d1a3cc9fc0260d4371a93bfb-1441x901.png?w=670&amp;h=419&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6c7038e10ba17893d1a3cc9fc0260d4371a93bfb-1441x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6c7038e10ba17893d1a3cc9fc0260d4371a93bfb-1441x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6c7038e10ba17893d1a3cc9fc0260d4371a93bfb-1441x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6c7038e10ba17893d1a3cc9fc0260d4371a93bfb-1441x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6c7038e10ba17893d1a3cc9fc0260d4371a93bfb-1441x901.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>“I’m tired of excuses that there aren’t enough women to speak at conferences or lead teams. Yes, there are! They’re right here!” Jules told Figma. “I want it to be normal for people to have as many female voices on their screens as they do male voices.”</p><p>Jules was inspired to make the website by a recent viral tweet from Shopify Design Lead Helen Tran. Helen was sick of people naming only male design influencers during discussions, so she asked her followers to recommend the women they most respect in the industry.</p><p>Her tweet reverberated through Silicon Valley’s design community and the response was electric. Within days it had been retweeted 256 times, liked 704 times and received 368 replies, with everyone weighing in from <a href="https://twitter.com/cap/status/857258561830891521">Buzzfeed’s VP of Design</a> to one of <a href="https://twitter.com/dburka/status/857566038472503297">Google Ventures’ Design Partners.</a> People sent over more than 450 names.</p><p>With a simple question, Helen reminded people that despite the gender inequality in tech, talented female product designers are everywhere.</p><p>In making the website Women Who Design, Jules is initially pulling the names from people who responded to Helen’s tweet. But she’ll include a nomination form on the site so she can add more submissions over time. The list could be used for recruiting purposes, but it also may serve as a general resource for talented people to follow or try to work for. She provided an email for anyone who wants to opt out of the list — whether because they’re uncomfortable being labeled “a woman in design,” or in case they don’t want their information easily searchable.</p><p>“This is a painful paradox and one I haven’t fully worked through myself yet,” Jules admitted. “I don’t want to create a situation where talented designers are judged by a modifier like gender, but I also know it’s important, especially for younger women, to know they have peers and leaders to look up to. I hope with time that the right balance becomes clear.”</p><p>Regardless, Jules’ website and the response to Helen’s tweet are both powerful reminders that the old excuse — there’s no women qualified for this role or conference speaking slot — just doesn’t cut it. To find talented hires or inspiring role models, you only have to look.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New faces at the Figma helm</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/new-faces-at-the-figma-helm/</link>
      <description>Kris Rasmussen and Eric Wittman join Figma</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re entering the next phase of our business <a href="https://www.figma.com/">at Figma</a>, and there’s a lot of work ahead of us. As the tech industry matures, more companies are realizing how important design is for building products customers love. Major corporations like <a href="https://qz.com/755741/ibm-is-becoming-the-worlds-largest-design-company/">IBM</a> and <a href="https://gigaom.com/2014/04/27/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-how-ge-is-using-design-to-change-how-people-use-its-machines/">GE</a> are going on designer hiring sprees and companies like Facebook are trying to to hire one designer for every four or five engineers.</p><p>Despite this insatiable demand, the technology designers need to do their jobs hasn’t kept up. Designers need tools that make collaboration easier, and we’re using that as our north star as we plan the future of Figma.</p><p>On that note, I’m excited to announce two new major hires: Eric Wittman, formerly of Atlassian, has joined as our first COO, and Kris Rasmussen, coming from Asana, will be our new Vice President of Engineering. Eric and Kris are seasoned pros at growing collaboration companies, and they’ll help us make the most of the opportunity in front of us.</p><h2 id="eric-wittman"><a href="#eric-wittman">Eric Wittman</a></h2><p>To give you a little background on the fresh faces, Eric’s an industry veteran who previously ran the Developer Tools business at Atlassian, including Bitbucket. At Figma, in addition to scaling processes like recruiting and finance, he’ll be focusing on GTM and revenue. While Eric has only been at Figma for a few months now, he already helped us launch our pricing model and nail down company strategy + values.</p><p>I’m not surprised Eric’s such an effective strategist — when we first met, his unconventional back story showed he would be. In his early years, he started in customer support at Macromedia, but through determination and ingenuity ultimately rose through the ranks to become the lead product manager on Flash. He picked up startup experience as the CEO of music player Songbird, and learned the ins and outs of SaaS and bottoms-up business models as GM of Developer Tools at Atlassian.</p><p>For an operations pro he’s deeply passionate about product — in fact, I initially passed over him in our first interview because he spent so much time talking about our application that I thought he was solely a product guy. But it turned out he’s a business expert who just happens to geek out on product — a perfect fit for Figma.</p><h2 id="kris-rasmussen"><a href="#kris-rasmussen">Kris Rasmussen</a></h2><p>We initially brought Kris in as a part-time contractor. Even though he was only here two days a week he quickly became an informal leader on the team in a powerful, unassuming way. He was always the person saying what needed to be said or helping move the ball forward when disagreements arose.</p><p>As we dug into Kris’ background, we learned Kris was not only an incredible engineer, but also an accomplished leader. He ran engineering at Asana in its early days, which gave him experience both guiding a team and building infrastructure for collaborative tools. Before Asana, he helped scale engineering at Aptana, a company which makes developer tools for web applications. Lastly, on his own personal projects, he worked on some super interesting applications of 3D graphics.</p><p>Kris will help us continue to build a world class technical team at Figma, and oversee many of our engineering projects. I couldn’t be more thrilled to have him on board.</p><h2 id="we-re-hiring"><a href="#we-re-hiring">We’re hiring!</a></h2><p>We’re only just getting started at Figma; there are many exciting opportunities and challenges ahead of us. If you’re a talented engineer, designer, writer or product manager with a deep passion for design, please check out our <a href="https://www.figma.com/careers/">open positions</a> and get in touch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a pioneering approach that brings design and engineering closer together, and it’s the brainchild of <a href="https://twitter.com/jongold">Airbnb designer Jon Gold</a>.</p><p>He’s a “design technologist,” which means <a href="https://jon.gold/">his website</a> is a funky array of cascading code, and he spends a lot of time furiously hacking away at futuristic design technology. He may be machine, not man, no one knows.</p><p>He first garnered attention in the product design community for creating an <a href="https://jon.gold/2016/05/robot-design-school/">AI-powered application</a> that could learn and recommend the best font pairings. These days, he’s helping Airbnb build out its design system, working on tools that will automate the process.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> staff, Jon’s a bit of a nerd, so we sat him down to find out what books shaped him as a designer. We chatted a few weeks ago, but given the release of his React project it seemed like a good time to share the interview. He recommends some awesome, obscure reads for anyone interested in the convergence of design and engineering. These are his words, although we edited for clarity and length.</p><h2 id="karl-gerstner-designing-programmes"><a href="#karl-gerstner-designing-programmes">Karl Gerstner — Designing Programmes</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/930e3ce1897c8ab35321178b4f60ceb8a15f6865-1194x796.png?rect=0,0,1193,796&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/930e3ce1897c8ab35321178b4f60ceb8a15f6865-1194x796.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/930e3ce1897c8ab35321178b4f60ceb8a15f6865-1194x796.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/930e3ce1897c8ab35321178b4f60ceb8a15f6865-1194x796.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/930e3ce1897c8ab35321178b4f60ceb8a15f6865-1194x796.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/930e3ce1897c8ab35321178b4f60ceb8a15f6865-1194x796.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1193w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><em>Designing Programmes</em> is 53 years old. It was never published as an e-book and it was impossible to find in libraries, or on Amazon. So I would occasionally see a photo of a page and be like ‘Oh my god, that’s amazing and I want to read more,’ but I couldn’t. I wound up buying Paul Rand’s copy of it at at an auction. I got the most expensive version of it, it’s all stained and the pages are yellow, it’s got the stamps from my favorite designer’s personal library. I love it. [Editor’s note: After Jon bought the book at an auction, it was reprinted by the publisher and is now available online.]</p><p>It’s the best book about thinking about design as a process that generates assets rather than humans generating final assets. It’s mostly concerning layout and logos and typography, but it still feel very relevant today. He was seeing design as this pipeline that humans can touch and mold but the resulting outcome is the outcome of the system. It’s interesting finding a book about design systems divorced from the context of UI design systems.</p><h2 id="_10-happier"><a href="#_10-happier">10% Happier</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/804316a014409ee1c08600f43e088e3b9578e373-900x600.png?rect=0,0,899,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/804316a014409ee1c08600f43e088e3b9578e373-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/804316a014409ee1c08600f43e088e3b9578e373-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/804316a014409ee1c08600f43e088e3b9578e373-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/804316a014409ee1c08600f43e088e3b9578e373-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 899w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><em>10% Happier</em> is a book about meditation, which is one of the habits I’ve introduced into my life that affects my design process and outlook on the world. Meditation makes me less inclined to respond with a visceral gut reaction to things and take the time to scratch away and see what the best course of action might be.</p><p>But this book doesn’t focus on the technique — it’s a memoir of Dan Harris, who’s been a prominent ABC anchor for years. He suffered a nervous breakdown live on air in 2004. Someone suggested he try meditation, and since he’s a famous journalist he interviewed Deepak Chopra and others to research meditation practices. The reason I love this book so much is because he’s so skeptical about everything — any notion of woo woo or metaphysical stuff.</p><h2 id="the-dream-machine"><a href="#the-dream-machine">The Dream Machine</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aac0ba215575ea860c17f5cff51ade1f29bc5039-900x600.png?rect=0,0,899,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aac0ba215575ea860c17f5cff51ade1f29bc5039-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aac0ba215575ea860c17f5cff51ade1f29bc5039-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aac0ba215575ea860c17f5cff51ade1f29bc5039-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/aac0ba215575ea860c17f5cff51ade1f29bc5039-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 899w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Ostensibly <em>The Dream Machine</em> is about one of my heroes, J. C. R. Licklider. He pioneered the idea of man-computer symbiosis — using computers to boost the intellect of humans and have these cooperative, fun collaborations.</p><p>It also covers the historical people who came together at this special time and place to rebel against IBM’s vision of computing, which was this sterile mainstream vision — people providing punchcards and waiting days and days to see the results of their programs. This group instead believed that computers should be highly interactive, things that people love using that augment the human brain. They fought for this other vision for decades before it became the winner. I appreciate the rebelliousness, and I try to carry those principles through my work today.</p><h2 id="deep-work"><a href="#deep-work">Deep Work</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ecb31ab06f88068701a10419972e3c9ba671787f-900x600.png?rect=0,0,899,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=447&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ecb31ab06f88068701a10419972e3c9ba671787f-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ecb31ab06f88068701a10419972e3c9ba671787f-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ecb31ab06f88068701a10419972e3c9ba671787f-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ecb31ab06f88068701a10419972e3c9ba671787f-900x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 899w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The theme of <em>Deep Work</em> was ‘social media is the worst distraction.’ It breaks your focus in the moment and stops you from forming big ideas if you’re constantly resetting your imagination.

Functional programming is a paradigm of programming where you break everything down into the smallest possible chunks, then you control and rearrange them.

There’s a lot of parallels you can directly apply to your work day to day — it’s about composition and I think this is something super useful for the design system we’re working on.

      <title>An alternative approach to rate limiting</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/an-alternative-approach-to-rate-limiting/</link>
      <description>Our rate limiting system is homegrown, and I’d like to explain its design in case it’s useful to others.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks ago <a href="https://www.figma.com/">at Figma</a>, we experienced our first-ever spam attack. This proved the value of Figma’s rate limiter and finally put a stop to the longstanding joke that I had built it in vain.</p><p>During the attack, the spammers sent unsolicited invitations for documents to scores of email addresses. Had we not discovered the attack, we could have faced a huge surge in our delivery costs and a decline in our email sender reputation. Thankfully, we got wind of the attack early on and avoided this outcome because our rate limiter detected the spammers’ flurry of requests.</p><p>Our rate limiting system is homegrown, and I’d like to explain its design in case it’s useful to others. It combines a few standard techniques to control the rate at which people issue requests to your server, and it’s relatively accurate, simple, and space-efficient. If you’re a company building web applications at consumer scale, our rate limiter can prevent users from harming your website’s availability with a spate of requests. It also happens to be great at stopping spam attacks, as we discovered.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, a rate limiter caps how many requests a sender — this could be a user or an IP address — can issue in a specific window of time (e.g. 25 requests per minute). In Figma’s case, it also needed to:</p><ul><li>store data externally so that the multiple machines running our web application could share it</li><li>not appreciably slow down web requests</li><li>efficiently eject outdated data</li><li>accurately limit excessive use of our web application</li><li>use as little memory as possible</li></ul><p>The first three requirements were easy to meet. At Figma, we use two external data stores — Redis and PostgreSQL — and Redis was the better location to save tracking data. Redis is an in-memory data store that offers extremely quick reads and writes relative to PostgreSQL, an on-disk relational database. Even better, it’s simple to specify when Redis should delete expired data.</p><p>Finding a way to satisfy the last two requirements — accurately controlling web traffic and minimizing memory usage — was more of a challenge. Here are the existing rate limiter implementations I considered:</p><ul><li>Token bucket</li><li>Fixed window counters</li><li>Sliding window log</li></ul><p>Let’s look at how each of them work and compare them in terms of accuracy and memory usage. This will give us some context for the final approach we took to build the rate limiter that spared us from the spammers.</p><h3 id="token-bucket"><a href="#token-bucket">Token bucket</a></h3><p>A simple Google search for “rate limit algorithm” points us to the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket#Algorithm">token bucket algorithm</a> (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket#The_Leaky_Bucket_Algorithm_as_a_Meter">leaky bucket as a meter algorithm</a>). For each unique user, we would record their last request’s Unix timestamp and available token count within a hash in Redis. We would store these two values in a hash rather than as two separate Redis keys for <a href="https://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization">memory efficiency</a>. An example hash would look like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e07f66e44b30989725d8859e99ad39e833fcaa1b-700x114.png?w=670&amp;h=109&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e07f66e44b30989725d8859e99ad39e833fcaa1b-700x114.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e07f66e44b30989725d8859e99ad39e833fcaa1b-700x114.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e07f66e44b30989725d8859e99ad39e833fcaa1b-700x114.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e07f66e44b30989725d8859e99ad39e833fcaa1b-700x114.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 700w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>User 1 has two tokens left in their token bucket and made their last request on Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 10:00 GMT.</figcaption></figure><p>Whenever a new request arrives from a user, the rate limiter would have to do a number of things to track usage. It would fetch the hash from Redis and refill the available tokens based on a chosen refill rate and the time of the user’s last request. Then, it would update the hash with the current request’s timestamp and the new available token count. When the available token count drops to zero, the rate limiter knows the user has exceeded the limit.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31feec268940476dbf54511da695192da8cc9893-605x1271.png?w=670&amp;h=1408&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31feec268940476dbf54511da695192da8cc9893-605x1271.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31feec268940476dbf54511da695192da8cc9893-605x1271.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/31feec268940476dbf54511da695192da8cc9893-605x1271.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 605w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>If User 1’s token bucket empties faster than it refills and no tokens are left, User 1 has exceeded the rate limit.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the token bucket algorithm’s elegance and tiny memory footprint, its Redis operations aren’t atomic.

If two separate processes served each of these requests and concurrently read the available token count before either of them updated it, each process would think the user had a single token left and that they had not hit the rate limit.</p><p>Our token bucket implementation could achieve atomicity if each process were to fetch a <a href="https://redis.io/topics/distlock">Redis lock</a> for the duration of its Redis operations. This, however, would come at the expense of slowing down concurrent requests from the same user and introducing another layer of complexity. Alternatively, we could make the token bucket’s Redis operations atomic <a href="https://gist.github.com/ptarjan/e38f45f2dfe601419ca3af937fff574d#request-rate-limiter">via Lua scripting</a>. For simplicity, however, I decided to avoid the unnecessary complications of adding another language to our codebase.</p><h3 id="fixed-window-counters"><a href="#fixed-window-counters">Fixed window counters</a></h3><p>As a second approach, I considered fixed window counters. It’s a simple, memory-efficient algorithm that records the number of requests from a sender occurring in the rate limit’s time interval. Unlike the token bucket algorithm, this approach’s Redis operations are atomic. Each request would increment a Redis key that included the request’s timestamp. A given Redis key might look like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a66813a322477b89709c654086107d752fd0575-500x114.png?rect=0,0,499,114&amp;w=670&amp;h=153&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a66813a322477b89709c654086107d752fd0575-500x114.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/5a66813a322477b89709c654086107d752fd0575-500x114.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 499w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>User 1 has made 1 request between 10:00:00 AM GMT and 10:00:59 GMT on Thursday, March 30, 2017.</figcaption></figure><p>When incrementing the request count for a given timestamp, we would compare its value to our rate limit to decide whether to reject the request.

Despite a rate limit of 5 requests per minute, we’ve now allowed 10 requests in less than one minute!</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/15b3876229c2097fcfa28e8da27248d04997a99e-624x474.png?w=670&amp;h=509&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/15b3876229c2097fcfa28e8da27248d04997a99e-624x474.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/15b3876229c2097fcfa28e8da27248d04997a99e-624x474.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/15b3876229c2097fcfa28e8da27248d04997a99e-624x474.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 624w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>If we count requests in fixed minute windows, we could let through up to twice the number of allowed requests per minute.</figcaption></figure><p>We could avoid this issue by adding another rate limit with a smaller threshold and shorter enforcement window — e.g. 2 requests per second in addition to 5 requests per minute — but this would overcomplicate the rate limit.

This would allow us to efficiently remove all of the set’s members with outdated timestamps and count the size of the set afterward.

Namely, the rate limiter continues to count requests even after the user exceeds the rate limit. I was comfortable with this behavior, as it would just extend a ban on a malicious user rather than letting their requests through as soon as the window of time had passed.</p><p>While the precision of the sliding window log approach may be useful for a developer API, it leaves a considerably large memory footprint because it stores a value for every request. This wasn’t ideal for Figma. A single rate limit of 500 requests per day per user on a website with 10,000 active users per day could hypothetically mean storing 5,000,000 values in Redis. If each stored timestamp value in Redis were even a 4-byte integer, this would take ~20 MB (4 bytes per timestamp * 10,000 users * 500 requests/user = 20,000,000 bytes).</p><h3 id="sliding-window-counters"><a href="#sliding-window-counters">Sliding window counters</a></h3><p>Ultimately, the last two rate limiter approaches — fixed window counters and sliding window log — inspired the algorithm that stopped the spammers. We count requests from each sender using multiple fixed time windows 1/60th the size of our rate limit’s time window.</p><p>For example, if we have an hourly rate limit, we increment counters specific to the current Unix minute timestamp and calculate the sum of all counters in the past hour when we receive a new request. To reduce our memory footprint, we store our counters in a Redis hash — they offer <a href="https://redis.io/topics/memory-optimization">extremely efficient storage when they have fewer than 100 keys.</a> When each request increments a counter in the hash, it also sets the hash to expire an hour later. In the event that a user makes requests every minute, the user’s hash can grow large from holding onto counters for bygone timestamps. We prevent this by regularly removing these counters when there are a considerable number of them.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0bdf32192ad10b212fe703e04a0d6201c2ebab86-642x1385.png?w=670&amp;h=1445&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0bdf32192ad10b212fe703e04a0d6201c2ebab86-642x1385.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0bdf32192ad10b212fe703e04a0d6201c2ebab86-642x1385.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0bdf32192ad10b212fe703e04a0d6201c2ebab86-642x1385.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 642w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>When the sum of the counters with timestamps in the past hour exceeds the request threshold, User 1 has exceeded the rate limit.</figcaption></figure><p>Let’s compare the memory usage of this algorithm with our calculation from the sliding window log algorithm. If we have a rate limit of 500 requests per day per user on a website with 10,000 active users, we would at most need to store ~600,000 values in Redis. That comes out to a memory footprint of ~2.4 MB (4 bytes per counter * 60 counters * 10,000 users = 2,400,000 bytes). This is a bit more scalable.</p><h3 id="practical-considerations"><a href="#practical-considerations">Practical considerations</a></h3><p>Using fixed window counters with a 1:60 ratio between the counter’s time window and the rate limit’s enforcement time window, our rate limiter was accurate down to the second and significantly minimized memory usage. In practice, however, a large enforcement time window — e.g. one hour — slightly reduced the precision of the rate limiter. This is best illustrated through an example: For an hourly rate limit, when the rate limiter checks usage at 11:00:35, it ignores the requests that occurred between 10:00:00 and 10:00:59.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cbecdc7bac660047990a9b2b97db361d4c296d99-658x420.png?rect=0,0,657,420&amp;w=670&amp;h=428&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cbecdc7bac660047990a9b2b97db361d4c296d99-658x420.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cbecdc7bac660047990a9b2b97db361d4c296d99-658x420.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/cbecdc7bac660047990a9b2b97db361d4c296d99-658x420.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 657w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>If we count requests in 60 fixed minute windows and check the number of requests when we’re within a fixed minute window, we may undercount the total number of requests in the last hour. Above, the rate limiter ignores the three requests that occurred between 10:00:00 and 10:00:59.</figcaption></figure><p>This slight degree of variable leniency — up to 59 seconds — may be acceptable depending on your use case. In our situation, however, we preferred for our rate limiter to sometimes be a tad harsher instead of slightly lenient, so I calculated the sum of all counters in the last hour and one minute whenever the current timestamp wasn’t divisible by 60. Variable restrictiveness could even be useful in discouraging programmatic scripting against the site.</p><p>Finally, we had to reflect on how to respond to users who exceeded the rate limit. Traditionally, web applications respond to requests from users who surpass the rate limit with a HTTP response code of 429. Our rate limiter initially did so as well. But in the case of Figma’s spam attack, our attackers saw the response code change from 200 to 429 and simply created new accounts to circumvent the rate limiting on their blocked accounts. In response, we implemented a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_banning">shadow ban</a>: On the surface, the attackers continued to receive a 200 HTTP response code, but behind the scenes we simply stopped sending document invitations after they exceeded the rate limit.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="rGU8_J6ahGqT" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>While the spam attack is over for now, new types of incidents can and will happen in the future and we’ll continue to adjust our rate limiter as needed.</p><p><em>Like tackling tough engineering problems like this?

Celebrating the fundamentals of design</a></h3><p>Every design begins with same basic elements — points, lines, and shapes. Similarly, even the most complex designs can be reduced to these indispensable pieces. It’s our belief that a great design is one where these pieces are used efficiently together.</p><p>For instance, early on when designing Figma we often talked about what tools you need to create modern design for screens. We realized that the tool set does not have to be large if the tools are carefully selected and work together well. With a small set of functions (like the vector-network tool or a frame), designers can create a lot of different things to form complex means of expression.</p><p>The same is true for communications design. You can create much of our designed world by using a small set of elemental shapes to build things of great complexity. Although the use of primary shapes and colors was famously promoted at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauhaus">Bauhaus school</a> as fundamental to design, these forms have been part of the language of design for hundreds of years.</p><p>Figma exists to empower and enable designers and their teams to create their best work. Since that’s our purpose, we decided to celebrate the fundamentals that inform all design — the simple shapes, or building blocks, that go into every design project.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e841532717a4059efff393ff0e0e7407967e1eef-2000x972.png?rect=1,0,1998,972&amp;w=670&amp;h=326&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e841532717a4059efff393ff0e0e7407967e1eef-2000x972.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e841532717a4059efff393ff0e0e7407967e1eef-2000x972.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e841532717a4059efff393ff0e0e7407967e1eef-2000x972.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e841532717a4059efff393ff0e0e7407967e1eef-2000x972.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e841532717a4059efff393ff0e0e7407967e1eef-2000x972.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="_2-encouraging-play"><a href="#_2-encouraging-play">2. Encouraging play</a></h3><p>The second concept that underpinned our new icon was ‘encouraging play.’ We believe the way to discover new solutions to old problems is through (sometimes very structured) experimentation and play. Designing with an open mind leads to more interesting outcomes, in addition to being more fun to work this way. As we designed our icon we had children’s playing blocks in mind — something reflected in our bright color choices and the shapes themselves.</p><p>Play has a long history in the world of design. Some of the most significant designers made children’s books later in their careers — from the <a href="https://vimeo.com/11905636">experimental</a> <a href="https://www.corraini.com/en/catalogo/scheda_libro/31/I-prelibri">books</a> of <a href="https://www.smarten-up.com/blog/2012/8/21/bruno-munaris-childrens-books">Bruno Munari</a>, to the <a href="https://www.paul-rand.com/foundation/thoughts_designAndthePlayInstinct/#.W5GnmJNKi9Z">many children’s works of Ann and Paul Rand</a>. While there’s many reasons for this return to basics, one purpose might be to recapture the creative space that play allows for.</p><p>Just as we hope that our tool enables this way of working, our icon aims to capture the same spirit of openness.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6d2cf044a89ffb031da9c344359992500f3e1e5b-2000x1000.png?w=670&amp;h=335&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6d2cf044a89ffb031da9c344359992500f3e1e5b-2000x1000.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6d2cf044a89ffb031da9c344359992500f3e1e5b-2000x1000.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6d2cf044a89ffb031da9c344359992500f3e1e5b-2000x1000.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6d2cf044a89ffb031da9c344359992500f3e1e5b-2000x1000.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/6d2cf044a89ffb031da9c344359992500f3e1e5b-2000x1000.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="_3-design-as-a-system"><a href="#_3-design-as-a-system">3. Design as a system</a></h3><p>Thinking about design as a modular system is not new, but seems to make more sense than ever in designing digital products. As software plays an ever increasing role in our lives, the digital world continues to fragment into myriad screen sizes, internet connection speeds, monitors and operating systems. As a result, it makes sense to create components for design that can work together, like a recipe or blueprint, rather than one-off solutions. Here at Figma, we often talk of designing systems, not artifacts.</p><p>An example of this is designing with vectors rather then pixels. If you can create a design that is made up of a ruleset, it can adapt to any environment. If you design with a fixed set of pixels, they’re bound to break down in the wrong context.</p><p>At Figma we’ve <a href="https://blog.figma.com/team-libraries-in-figma-409fa5e20f7">introduced features</a> to empower designers building these systems, and we wanted our icon to also suggest this style of work. We created a system whereby the icon is constructed from three simple shapes and a modular grid. We hope you can imagine creating your own design with these same components.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="edxKgLvdjDgO" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>The new icon is on our website, across social media, and will soon appear on your desktops if you use the Figma native apps.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46a76c802176eb17b04e12108de7e7e0f3736dc6-1024x1024.png?w=670&amp;h=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46a76c802176eb17b04e12108de7e7e0f3736dc6-1024x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46a76c802176eb17b04e12108de7e7e0f3736dc6-1024x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46a76c802176eb17b04e12108de7e7e0f3736dc6-1024x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46a76c802176eb17b04e12108de7e7e0f3736dc6-1024x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/46a76c802176eb17b04e12108de7e7e0f3736dc6-1024x1024.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1024w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><em>The design team at Figma is Johan Prag, Rasmus Andersson and Chris Hamamoto.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Advice on becoming a virtual reality designer from Facebook’s VR team</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/advice-on-becoming-a-virtual-reality-designer-from-facebooks-vr-team/</link>
      <description>A few members of Facebook’s virtual reality team gave tips on breaking into the field.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For designers looking for a challenge, the bold new world of virtual reality beckons. It’s an emerging field where the rules haven’t been written yet and experts are few and far between.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma design</a> team is intrigued by this Wild West, so we swung by a VR talk at <a href="https://tradecraft.com/">Tradecraft</a>, a startup school with design, sales, and engineering tracks. A few members of Facebook’s virtual reality team gave tips on breaking into the field and talked about the nature of the work. We’ve pulled out the highlights from the conversation below.</p><p>Your experts:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae4863c012a9197337634826aa38935fee25d17b-228x200.png?w=670&amp;h=588&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ae4863c012a9197337634826aa38935fee25d17b-228x200.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 228w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><a href="https://twitter.com/gabrielvaldivia">Gabe Valdivia</a> — Gabe’s been a designer at Facebook for over three years, with the last year spent on the virtual reality team. Before Facebook he was the all-hands designer for the connected car startup Automatic.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/337d3427160184124a533d47bef44e590058cf76-220x206.png?w=670&amp;h=627&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/337d3427160184124a533d47bef44e590058cf76-220x206.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 220w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p><a href="https://twitter.com/katya_alexander">Katya Kostyukova</a> — Katya started her career in architecture before moving into product design. Her first virtual reality job was at the VR media company Emergent, and she joined Facebook’s VR team seven months ago.</p><h3 id="what-are-three-pieces-of-tactical-advice-you-wish"><a href="#what-are-three-pieces-of-tactical-advice-you-wish">What are three pieces of tactical advice you wish you could’ve given yourself before you got into Virtual Reality?</a></h3><p><strong>Gabe:</strong> Don’t wait for permission. Make a project up and play with it yourself. It’s not a big community, so if you do that today a year from now you’ll be in the top 1 percent of VR designers in the world.</p><p><strong>Katya:</strong> If I can speak to my own story, when I got an offer to join Emergent VR I was crying because it was really intimidating. How do you prototype or do user research in VR? But then I talked to people in the industry and they told me, “Don’t worry, nobody knows!”</p><h3 id="what-were-the-specific-challenges-you-faced"><a href="#what-were-the-specific-challenges-you-faced">What were the specific challenges you faced moving from 2D design to 3D?</a></h3><p><strong>Gabe:</strong> In 2D, a couple rectangles and a squiggly line means ‘Oh my god it’s an app!’ But to really explore 3D in virtual reality, you have to sketch in relationship to the user. How do they react to your movement, do they follow your gaze, how far away are they?</p><p><strong>Katya:</strong> Bring your design to VR as soon as possible — it’s really important because it will look extremely different. There’s <a href="https://www.vrfocus.com/2016/09/unreal-engine-4-13-brings-vr-templates-heres-how-to-get-started-on-your-own-vr-game/">VR templates</a>, as simple as loading the pictures into a 360 sphere. What’s the focus in the foreground or the background? What’s in the peripheral vision, which is the curiosity zone? That can become the uncomfortable angle for your neck.</p><h3 id="what-are-your-favorite-tools-and-what-stage-of"><a href="#what-are-your-favorite-tools-and-what-stage-of">What are your favorite tools and what stage of development do you use one tool over another?</a></h3><p><strong>Gabe:</strong> When I joined the VR team I was like ‘I’m never going to touch Sketch again it will be awesome!’ But surprisingly, 50 percent of my time is still in Sketch. Virtual reality UI is still UI, you still have icons and text you have to lay out in some sort of surface. You default to whatever tool you know.</p><p><strong>Katya:</strong> The next step is getting into Unity and playing around with visuals, literally putting a cylinder around you and applying the UI environment as a texture tells you a lot about it — is that the tone or feeling I want to invoke? </p><p><strong>Gabe:</strong> Unity, again, is free and has the biggest online community, so when you Google how to do something you find it.</p><h3 id="how-many-hours-a-week-do-you-spend-with-a-headset"><a href="#how-many-hours-a-week-do-you-spend-with-a-headset">How many hours a week do you spend with a headset on?</a></h3><p><strong>Katya:</strong> I’m working on virtual reality and 360 audio so with all the testing, we try to do some of our team meetings in virtual reality to use our own products. Cumulatively I’m probably in a headset about an hour and a half a day.</p><p><strong>Gabe:</strong> Agreed.</p><h3 id="with-big-players-trying-to-be-pioneer-virtual"><a href="#with-big-players-trying-to-be-pioneer-virtual">With big players trying to be pioneer virtual reality, who has the edge?</a></h3><p><strong>Gabe:</strong> We literally get paid to say Facebook. In all seriousness though, Google and PlayStation are two big players, Google from the ‘making it accessible to everyone’ perspective and PlayStation from a utilitarian one. Everyone that has a PlayStation can now access VR and a catalogue of gaming within the Sony umbrella.</p><p><strong>Katya:</strong> Certain companies like Jaunt VR or even Lucasfilm — they are working on virtual reality or augmented reality. They’re making impressive experiences that are immersive entertainment. Facebook does have an edge in social VR because of all this data we have on social experiences.</p><p><strong>Gabe:</strong> I wouldn’t underestimate Snapchat, they may not be doing VR but they’re making it ok to have a camera on your face. Not just ok, but cool.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="fcpLyPxnMMsP" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p><em>At Figma, we’re amazed by the cool things people are doing across the product design community and decided to start highlighting these stories on our blog.

      <title>Deciding whether to learn code wasn’t always such a weird rite of passage</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/deciding-whether-to-learn-code-wasnt-always-such-a-weird-rite-of-passage/</link>
      <description>Interview with Alex Cornell, the lead designer of Facebook Live</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This is the first interview in a new Figma series about designers’ ‘zag moments,’ where we talk to product builders about the unconventional choices in their career that led them to where they are now.</em></p><p>Should you learn to code? It’s a question that feels like it’s been around since neanderthal designers were sketching buffaloes on cave walls. But a decade ago, the dilemma wasn’t the “weird rite of passage people have to go through on Twitter” that it is today, says Alex Cornell, the designer in charge of Facebook Live. As a young designer, Cornell decided to learn film and photography instead, an expertise that paid off years later when Facebook recruited him to help launch their Live feature.</p><p>We talked to Cornell about why he decided to forego the heavily trodden code path and forge his own route.</p><p><strong>So Alex, I hear you’re not a designer slash coder. Why?</strong></p><p>When I was making that decision in 2007, that wasn’t a question floating around Twitter, it was just a decision you had to make. Do I want to learn to code or play the piano? Nothing more complicated than that.</p><p>Where I was, at a startup with a bunch of engineers, it seemed like a waste. We had four guys who knew deeply how to code — went to school for it, came out of Google — and then me who’s a beginning designer. We’re a team of people, it would be beneficial to learn something no one else knows how to do.</p><p>So what else would be helpful? For me it became filmmaking in general — After Effects, Premiere, the technical part of filmmaking. After Effects was probably the most helpful since there weren’t prototyping tools back then, I would use it to animate faces the way I thought we should show them.</p><p>Basically, that’s an easy way of saying coding sounded boring and making motion graphics didn’t.</p><p><strong>Do you ever regret that choice?</strong></p><p>Ten years later you always wonder ‘What would it have been like if I started taking Japanese lessons ten years ago?’ which is another thing I think about. I do regret not learning to code sometimes, but it doesn’t take too long to retrace the logical path I described and the same conclusion comes to me. Especially now, I work at Facebook and knowing how to code is not necessary but what I have learned over the years is very helpful — how to talk to engineers and help them understand how to translate design into their language.</p><p><strong>When young designers ask you whether they should learn to code what do you say?</strong></p><p>If they don’t know then the answer is probably no.</p><p>It always strikes me as a funny thing — if somebody asked me, “Should I learn to edit film?” I’d be like, “Well I don’t know — do you like film?” The next five questions would make the answer super obvious and I hope most people would be able to think of it on their own.</p><p>These days as the tools are getting blurred, where the boundary is between coding and design — the guy who works next to me works in Framer, I work in Origami and I’m building logic trees — the boundary is pretty blurry these days so it’s less of a binary.</p><p>That speaks to why this question keeps coming up. If there was a right answer to it and people understood ‘Yes designers should code’ there’d be no need for the question. But for everyone there’s a different right answer.</p><p><strong>If they choose to focus on something else besides coding, what do you recommend?</strong></p><p>The two that come to mind for me are writing and…I don’t know the right word for it, but communication or presentation. It’s one thing to do a great design and code it or do an awesome animation, but there’s a low chance of it going anywhere if you don’t get people excited about it. (Editor’s note: John Maeda recommended the same skill in his 2017 Design in Tech Report.)</p><p>In school they talk about presentation in the context of a design agency, but the way I mean it is more, ‘I’m in a room with three other people trying to convince them something’s a cool idea and I don’t mean in a formal way.’ You communicate an idea to someone else through speaking and presentation and that can take many forms, a film, a talk, a Powerpoint, whatever, those two skills together are exceptionally helpful in supporting my design work. If you’re good at that you can shift the sands in the direction you want something to go.</p><p>That’s one of the reasons I don’t advocate people skip school too early because I’ve found those two skills — the concrete one of writing and the emotional intelligence attached to that — those are really important and you can’t learn them in the same way you can learn coding or filmmaking.</p><h3 id="like-this-story-subscribe-here-to-get-updates"><a href="#like-this-story-subscribe-here-to-get-updates">Like this story?

      <description>Design State of the Union</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like Groundhog Day for designers, you know spring’s a comin’ when all-star designer John Maeda drops his state of the union — the 2017 Design in Tech Report. Slide decks may be a snooze, but this particular presentation will echo through tech for the next year, sneaking its way into founders’ fundraising pitches and other corners of Silicon Valley. It’s a 48 page presentation, so the Figma team pulled out our biggest takeaways and chatted with Maeda to get more color. You can check out the full video presentation here.</p><ol><li>Designer hiring sprees. Major corporations want more product designers than ever. In the last two years alone big companies acquired more than 35 design agencies. Facebook, Google and Amazon have hired 65 percent more designers in the past year. Why’s the demand happening now? “Because technology is so commoditized, anyone can make an app,” Maeda told us. “Now that you can do that, how does it make someone feel, how relevant is it to someone’s life? That’s more of a design question.”</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97f68a60077b72874c0a9d0d051eab8da617d34e-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97f68a60077b72874c0a9d0d051eab8da617d34e-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97f68a60077b72874c0a9d0d051eab8da617d34e-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97f68a60077b72874c0a9d0d051eab8da617d34e-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97f68a60077b72874c0a9d0d051eab8da617d34e-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/97f68a60077b72874c0a9d0d051eab8da617d34e-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><ol><li>Design inclusion.

Education hasn’t kept up with the product design demand. Most schools still focus on classical design — ala print era typography — and don’t teach people how to design for web and mobile. More than two thirds of students surveyed said they had to teach themselves digital skills from outside curriculum like Lynda.com. Maeda doesn’t have much hope for design schools changing anytime soon. “They’ll evolve at the rate they’re designed to evolve, which is slow and deliberate,” he said.</li></ol><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb5b97eca45300d441b8a010e128f5f357378675-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;h=377&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb5b97eca45300d441b8a010e128f5f357378675-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb5b97eca45300d441b8a010e128f5f357378675-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb5b97eca45300d441b8a010e128f5f357378675-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb5b97eca45300d441b8a010e128f5f357378675-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/bb5b97eca45300d441b8a010e128f5f357378675-1440x810.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><ol><li>Design-focused investing.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Snapchat’s usability sucks.

So we talked to five designers we respect to get their take.</p><p>Our panel:</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/rsg">Bobby Goodlatte</a>, Openvote</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/thatbenlifetho">Ben Wilkins</a>, Airbnb</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/Sahibajo">Sahiba Johar</a>, Roku</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/taramann">Tara Mann</a>, Basecamp</li><li><a href="https://twitter.com/joshelman">Josh Elman</a>, Greylock</li></ul><h3 id="snapchat-breaks-all-the-rules"><a href="#snapchat-breaks-all-the-rules">Snapchat breaks all the rules</a></h3><p>When asked about Snapchat, many designers heave a reluctant sigh. They’re loathe to admit — although they eventually do — that Snapchat’s power comes from its dreadful, chaotic interface. The app’s triumph spits in the face of modern product design values, undermining rule #1 — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Make-Me-Think-Usability/dp/0321344758">Don’t Make People Think</a>. Its success shows that great design isn’t always about usability.</p><p>“Too often designers get hung up on aesthetics and pixels,” <a href="https://medium.com/@rsg/bad-design-is-sometimes-the-best-design-4bbafdf66a60">said Bobby Goodlatte</a>, the CEO of political platform Openvote and an early product designer at Facebook. “Design is about solving a problem and sometimes the right solution to that problem is to create a space that’s less refined.”</p><p>“Less refined” is one word for it. “Insane” is another. Like an app designed by Willy Wonka, Snapchat pushes the limits of comprehension with hodgepodge chaos. The menu in the Stories section scrolls both vertically and horizontally. The camera screen includes buttons for a bunch of unrelated features. There’s no universal navigation bar to help people move through the app. Press one seemingly harmless icon and you’ve just accidentally sexted your boss (pro tip: never surf Snapchat while lounging naked folks).</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/893993d26f3b475eda96187983b98a35a31529cd-584x791.jpg?w=670&amp;h=907&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/893993d26f3b475eda96187983b98a35a31529cd-584x791.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/893993d26f3b475eda96187983b98a35a31529cd-584x791.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/893993d26f3b475eda96187983b98a35a31529cd-584x791.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 584w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h3 id="why-millennials-love-it"><a href="#why-millennials-love-it">Why millennials love it</a></h3><p>“When I first started using Snapchat I was like, ‘This is fucking ridiculous,’” said Ben Wilkins, a designer at Airbnb. But Wilkins finally understood the appeal when a friend inducted him into the Snapchat clan as they drank at a bar, showing him all the hidden filter functionalities. “The reason people love this is because it requires some level of tribal knowledge,” Wilkins said.</p><p>By burying some functionalities — like live video calling — Snapchat has made itself the digital version of the cool kids’ table in high school. It’s not surprising it’s so popular with kiddos, giving them their own walled garden that their parents can’t reach.</p><p>“It’s kind of slapped together and everything is all over the place but that’s ok because my life is all over the place,” Roku UX designer <a href="https://medium.com/the-design-perspective/https-medium-com-why-snapchat-totally-fails-2f5f13c824d0#.3uvsl14jl">Sahiba Johar said.</a> “Maybe that’s one of the reasons millennials love it.”</p><h3 id="it-s-a-design-pioneer"><a href="#it-s-a-design-pioneer">It’s a design pioneer</a></h3><p>Despite the interface’s insanity, some Snapchat features were major breakthroughs in design. It was the first big social app to open directly to the camera. That unconventional choice encouraged people to actually create their own content, instead of just consume others’ posts. Even the weird multidimensional navigation, where you swipe the screen to get to other parts of the app, arguably makes more sense for mobile than conventional UI, where you have to hit a tiny menu icon.</p><p>“Some designers resent its success because it doesn’t follow patterns we were taught to follow,” said Tara Mann, a mobile designer at Basecamp, a project management tool.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f1dda77915966ae88214500e02dc2b742507794-399x371.jpg?w=670&amp;h=623&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f1dda77915966ae88214500e02dc2b742507794-399x371.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2f1dda77915966ae88214500e02dc2b742507794-399x371.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 399w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>One of the traditional standards Snapchat broke was touch. Double tapping, swiping and holding became their own unique commands, shortcuts for functions that otherwise would require several buttons to reach (like starting a video). It also pioneered swiping to pull in filters over an image, instead of the thumbnail filter view of competitors like Instagram.</p><p>“You open to the camera and it automatically gives you ways to be funny and creative,” Mann said. “They were the first ones to do it in a big way.”</p><p>Of course, filters are a trick you’d never know if someone didn’t show you. Snapchat abandoned “intuitive UI” in favor of “shareable UI,” <a href="https://news.greylock.com/intuitive-design-vs-shareable-design-88ff6bb184bb#.o5u4d6ihv">a term coined</a> by consummate Valley product manager and Snapchat cool dad Josh Elman. Although he’s not technically a designer, we couldn’t let a story about his favorite app go by without getting his weigh in.</p><p>He argues that designers are fooling themselves if they think most products are intuitive and easy to use from the get-go.</p><p>“The first time people used Facebook they didn’t know what to do. The first time people used Excel, there’s a big grid of numbers — what the fuck do I do?” Elman said. “The lesson is: Design something powerful that people want to talk about rather than design it in a way that someone staring at it themselves will bumble through menu options.” Social apps particularly benefit from a design that forces people to consult their friends.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0736c6fae7768e8ffbc0767f99aa69176bfa0e49-403x359.jpg?w=670&amp;h=597&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0736c6fae7768e8ffbc0767f99aa69176bfa0e49-403x359.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/0736c6fae7768e8ffbc0767f99aa69176bfa0e49-403x359.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 403w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>So, was Snapchat secretly genius in its early UI adventures or was it all a happy accident? The company didn’t respond to our requests for comment — possibly because it was in the quiet period before the IPO — so designers took their best guesses. “I think it was a bunch of bad design that got sucked into an app,” said Wilkins. “But they can justify it as ‘We had our finger on the pulse of what the youth want.’”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Realtime Editing of Ordered Sequences</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/realtime-editing-of-ordered-sequences/</link>
      <description>One of the problems we had to solve when we added multiplayer editing to Figma was supporting simultaneous editing of ordered sequences of objects.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the problems we had to solve when we added <a href="https://blog.figma.com/multiplayer-editing-in-figma-8f8076c6c3a6">multiplayer editing</a> to Figma was supporting simultaneous editing of ordered sequences of objects. We have many compound object types in Figma (the document, groups, components, etc.) and each compound object has an ordered list of children. Users can insert new children, remove children, or drag them around to reorder them and everything updates in realtime:</p><figure><figcaption>Realtime collaborative editing of an ordered sequence in Figma</figcaption></figure><p>The core problem is maintaining eventual-consistency. Each client instantaneously applies its edits locally and then sends them off to the server, which then sends the edits to other connected clients. This means edits may be applied in a different order on each client. When designing the algorithm, we have to make sure the document ends up looking identical regardless of the order in which edits are applied.</p><h2 id="operational-transformation"><a href="#operational-transformation">Operational Transformation</a></h2><p>We initially considered using a technique called Operational Transformation to solve this. It’s an old algorithm that was originally developed for text and was popularized by early collaborative text editors such as Google Wave. While we didn’t end up using OT, it’s perhaps the most common approach to this type of problem and it’s useful to contrast OT with our approach. In OT, new operations are carefully transformed past other concurrent operations such that the resulting operation has the same effect:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/42f7de559f14a97ea68d9bb5fb4aae238318cda2-1400x1212.png?w=670&amp;h=580&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/42f7de559f14a97ea68d9bb5fb4aae238318cda2-1400x1212.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/42f7de559f14a97ea68d9bb5fb4aae238318cda2-1400x1212.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/42f7de559f14a97ea68d9bb5fb4aae238318cda2-1400x1212.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/42f7de559f14a97ea68d9bb5fb4aae238318cda2-1400x1212.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/42f7de559f14a97ea68d9bb5fb4aae238318cda2-1400x1212.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>An example of concurrent text editing using OT</figcaption></figure><p>In the picture above, transforming the operation <em>Delete(at: 1, n: 2)</em> past the operation <em>Insert(at: 0, text: “x”)</em> on the server and on client A results in a new operation <em>Delete(at: 2, n: 2)</em>. This is because the insert must affect the index of the delete to ensure that the text “bc” is still deleted. Transforming the operation <em>Insert(at: 0, text: “x”)</em> past the operation <em>Delete(at: 1, n: 2)</em> on client B is a no-op because the delete doesn’t affect the index of the insert.</p><p>That’s the basic idea at least. The actual implementation details are a lot more complex. They’re actually so complex that the <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Concurrency+control+in+groupware+systems">first paper on OT</a> had some <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=A+Survey+on+Operational+Transformation+Algorithms%3A+Challenges%2C+Issues+and+Achievements">subtle problems</a> that went undiscovered for several years. The problems have since been fixed and OT is a very viable algorithm, but the high implementation cost is only worth it you need the specific benefits it offers for editing text sequences.</p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><ul><li>Good performance and low memory overhead for very large sequences</li><li>Concurrent insertions are linearized instead of interleaved (i.e. inserting “abc” and “xyz” in the same place won’t make something like “axbycz”)</li></ul><p>Drawbacks:</p><ul><li>OT is hard to understand and hard to implement correctly</li><li>Reordering is usually done using a delete and insert instead of a move</li></ul><p>OT was overkill for us because we didn’t need to work with enormous sequences and we didn’t need to avoid interleaving. Reordering is also a very common operation in a layer-based design tool like ours and we wanted to make that efficient without additional complexity. With an OT system, adding more operations increases implementation complexity quadratically since every operation must transform correctly past every other operation.</p><h2 id="fractional-indexing"><a href="#fractional-indexing">Fractional Indexing</a></h2><p>Instead of OT, Figma uses a trick that’s often used to implement reordering on top of a database. Every object has a real number as an index and the order of the children for an element of the tree is determined by sorting all children by their index. To insert between two objects, just set the index for the new object to the average index of the two objects on either side. We use arbitrary-precision fractions instead of 64-bit doubles so that we can’t run out of precision after lots of edits.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dc3ac373a86b1d25629d651e2b75100dc3d9fbb9-1400x1144.png?rect=0,0,1400,1143&amp;w=670&amp;h=547&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dc3ac373a86b1d25629d651e2b75100dc3d9fbb9-1400x1144.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dc3ac373a86b1d25629d651e2b75100dc3d9fbb9-1400x1144.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dc3ac373a86b1d25629d651e2b75100dc3d9fbb9-1400x1144.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dc3ac373a86b1d25629d651e2b75100dc3d9fbb9-1400x1144.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/dc3ac373a86b1d25629d651e2b75100dc3d9fbb9-1400x1144.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>An example sequence of objects being edited</figcaption></figure><p>In our implementation, every index is a fraction between 0 and 1 exclusive. Being exclusive is important; it ensures we can always generate an index before or after an existing index by averaging with 0 or 1, respectively. Each index is stored as a string and averaging is done using string manipulation to retain precision. For compactness, we omit the leading “0.” from the fraction and we use the entire ASCII range instead of just the numbers 0–9 (base 95 instead of base 10).</p><p><strong>Benefits:</strong></p><ul><li>Easy to understand and implement</li><li>Reordering an object only involves editing a single value</li></ul><p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong></p><ul><li>Index length can grow over time</li><li>Merging new elements from multiple clients may interleave them</li><li>Averaging between two identical indices doesn’t work</li></ul><p>The first drawback (index length) isn’t a concern for us since we don’t need to order huge numbers of elements. The number of reordering operations is bounded by user activity in practice, and normal usage patterns never generate prohibitively-large index lengths.</p><p>The second drawback (interleaving) would be a concern for a text editor but isn’t really a concern for us given the nature of design documents. Interleaving concurrently inserted elements in a design is usually fine because the new objects likely don’t overlap. And if interleaving looks weird, users can just manually fix the ordering afterwards.</p><p>The third drawback (averaging identical indices) has a simple workaround that avoids this problem entirely. This case arises when two clients try to simultaneously insert a new object between the same two objects. The server can avoid ever having two objects with an identical position by just generating and assigning a unique position to the second insert operation.</p><p>We’ve been using fractional indexing for multiplayer editing in Figma from the beginning and it’s worked out really well for us. Even though OT provides some additional benefits around performance and interleaving, it’s much more beneficial for the Figma platform to use simple algorithms that are easy to understand and implement than to use the most advanced algorithms out there. It means more people can work on Figma, the implementation is more stable, and we can develop and ship features faster.</p><p><em>Like thinking about realtime collaboration?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The morning after Trump won the presidency, Portland designer Jen Thomas woke up wrapped in a blanket of dread. She joined her friends and fellow co-founders Julie Lesseg and Liz Neilson at their design agency <a href="https://www.thebeauty-shop.com/">The Beauty Shop</a>, where they hugged and cried.</p><p>But the period of grief didn’t last long — within hours, the trio decided to take action, posting on their Instagram account that they’d be offering pro-bono work to organizations representing women, people of color, Hispanic, Muslim, immigrant and LGBTQ communities. Responses poured in — within two days their follower count had quadrupled and they’d heard from 300 designers and studios who wanted to help, including a design team at Facebook.</p><h2 id="visible"><a href="#visible">Visible</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed43a5a0c1e84ca9051dad568485556cfbd3c530-1194x1194.png?w=670&amp;h=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed43a5a0c1e84ca9051dad568485556cfbd3c530-1194x1194.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed43a5a0c1e84ca9051dad568485556cfbd3c530-1194x1194.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed43a5a0c1e84ca9051dad568485556cfbd3c530-1194x1194.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed43a5a0c1e84ca9051dad568485556cfbd3c530-1194x1194.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/ed43a5a0c1e84ca9051dad568485556cfbd3c530-1194x1194.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1194w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The outpouring inspired Thomas, Lesseg and Neilson to form a coalition called <a href="https://visiblealliance.org/">Visible</a>, connecting designers with grassroots organizations that need help. It’s one of many design initiatives that has taken off since the November election.</p><p>The Obama years fostered a certain amount of complacency among progressive designers, but Trump’s first month in office lit bonfires of action under everyone’s asses. The new administration has forced product designers, illustrators, photographers and others to rethink their role in the new world order. It’s a political stirring we might not have seen otherwise.</p><p>“We’re giving away free logos, designers saving the world!” jokes Neilson. “But there’s truth that good design makes people think you’re legitimate — the structure we can build for people could contribute to their endeavors succeeding.”</p><p>After The Beauty Shop’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BMmgfYqhMC2">Instagram post</a> took off, organizations from around the United States contacted them for help. Thomas, Lesseg and Neilson picked twelve as the initial Visible partners, ranging from the Iowa Abortion Access fund, which gives women reproductive options, to Nightingale, a publication that raises awareness about America’s flawed healthcare system. The Yemen Peace Project, a think tank working on relations between Yemen and the United States, needed Visible’s assistance immediately because hackers attacked its website soon after the election.</p><h2 id="creative-action-network"><a href="#creative-action-network">Creative Action Network</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/188c0735001ac4edef72802f894ea2bfb067086f-1144x1154.png?w=670&amp;h=676&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/188c0735001ac4edef72802f894ea2bfb067086f-1144x1154.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/188c0735001ac4edef72802f894ea2bfb067086f-1144x1154.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/188c0735001ac4edef72802f894ea2bfb067086f-1144x1154.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/188c0735001ac4edef72802f894ea2bfb067086f-1144x1154.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/188c0735001ac4edef72802f894ea2bfb067086f-1144x1154.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1144w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The Beauty Shop is only one such group that’s crowdsourcing creatives.

In a strange twist, the President of Planned Parenthood bought one of the final prints. “I don’t know how she found it — she must have seen it on Twitter or something,” Bateman said. “I just suddenly had an order with a name I recognized and the Planned Parenthood address.”</p><p>With the success of the first run under her belt, Bateman moved on to raising money for The Sierra Club with a similar limited edition run of a drawing called Duck Day. “I really want to do more and I’m sure I could be more strategic,” Bateman said. “But this is one way.”</p><h2 id="ben-barry-former-facebook-designer"><a href="#ben-barry-former-facebook-designer">Ben Barry, Former Facebook designer</a></h2><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e06356b863d6f4413ec4f362f59150e9712f7410-1566x1138.png?w=670&amp;h=487&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e06356b863d6f4413ec4f362f59150e9712f7410-1566x1138.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e06356b863d6f4413ec4f362f59150e9712f7410-1566x1138.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e06356b863d6f4413ec4f362f59150e9712f7410-1566x1138.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e06356b863d6f4413ec4f362f59150e9712f7410-1566x1138.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/e06356b863d6f4413ec4f362f59150e9712f7410-1566x1138.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>For former Facebook <a href="https://twitter.com/benbarry">designer Ben Barry</a>, political action came in the form of freelance work for The New York Times. He doesn’t often agree to design stories for the newspaper because of how quickly they need the work completed. But when an editor asked him to create a joke job application mocking Trump, he couldn’t say no. “[Doing] that in one of the largest newspapers in the world against an administration I completely disagree with was a meaningful opportunity for me,” Barry said.</p><p>He pitched a bunch of formats for the fake job application design, from making it look like a field trip flyer for an elementary school — all comic sans and bad formatting — to mimicking an internal Russian document, as though the White House was a sub department of the Kremlin. Ultimately the Times went with big, gold and brassy, like Trump incarnated. When the Times published it, Barry tweeted, “This is easily one of the ugliest things I’ve ever been hired to design, but also one of the more meaningful.”</p><h3 id="suelyn-yu"><a href="#suelyn-yu">Suelyn Yu</a></h3><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44481d2ae59de4592c30ab18caabbcd5d56c7d4f-1600x796.jpg?rect=0,0,1600,795&amp;w=670&amp;h=333&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44481d2ae59de4592c30ab18caabbcd5d56c7d4f-1600x796.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44481d2ae59de4592c30ab18caabbcd5d56c7d4f-1600x796.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44481d2ae59de4592c30ab18caabbcd5d56c7d4f-1600x796.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44481d2ae59de4592c30ab18caabbcd5d56c7d4f-1600x796.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/44481d2ae59de4592c30ab18caabbcd5d56c7d4f-1600x796.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>Other designers focus on how they can create a ripple effect with their actions. <a href="https://www.suelynyu.com/">Suelyn Yu</a>, who ran product design for the experimental branch of the tech team on Hillary Clinton’s campaign, has started giving talks to product design organizations in San Francisco.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, we’re excited to announce the beta release of Team Libraries for sharing components across projects. With this release, we build on the foundation we established with Components to make design systems easier to create, maintain and use across an entire team. Team Libraries are available in the product today at figma.com.</p><h2 id="the-problem"><a href="#the-problem">The problem</a></h2><p>Many prevalent problems in product design today stem from the fact that most design tools were built to imitate traditional print design tools.</p><p>The core of these applications were either built for editing photos, doing complex illustration work, or making static rectangles with text on them. Physical paper doesn’t have interactivity, so while you could draw pictures of applications with these tools, they’d never really understand how the app would actually behave in different contexts. Communicating realistic application behavior in a static artboard or using constraints that don’t actually exist in a platform’s API just isn’t good enough.</p><p>To make matters worse, your source of truth is a moving target. When building out a design system, you might start with a master file with some nice documentation and a well-defined system of symbols. That’s a great start, but as soon as you copy symbols from one file to another, they’re out-of-sync and can only be updated manually. Now you have to dig through all your design documents, replace symbols and update their overrides one symbol at a time any time you make a minor change.</p><p>As designers, our tools just don’t support the synchronized and compounding component structures needed to create lasting design systems.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2555eedf35ceae8d5b6cf8f77e261fb370766b81-800x281.png?w=670&amp;h=235&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2555eedf35ceae8d5b6cf8f77e261fb370766b81-800x281.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2555eedf35ceae8d5b6cf8f77e261fb370766b81-800x281.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2555eedf35ceae8d5b6cf8f77e261fb370766b81-800x281.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/2555eedf35ceae8d5b6cf8f77e261fb370766b81-800x281.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Brad Frost’s Atomic Design</figcaption></figure><p>None of this is new. Design systems have been a hot topic of conversation in product design for a while now. There’s a reason the most successful design teams in the world like Facebook, Google, and Airbnb invest heavily in design systems to help their teams function more efficiently — because design tools have failed to keep up. As a result, these companies have had to build their own custom tools and hire staff whose entire job is to maintain these systems.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5212d72d943f0e2953bf338ade624d58f7270e9-800x381.png?w=670&amp;h=319&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5212d72d943f0e2953bf338ade624d58f7270e9-800x381.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5212d72d943f0e2953bf338ade624d58f7270e9-800x381.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5212d72d943f0e2953bf338ade624d58f7270e9-800x381.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/f5212d72d943f0e2953bf338ade624d58f7270e9-800x381.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Airbnb’s Design Language System</figcaption></figure><h2 id="bridging-the-gap"><a href="#bridging-the-gap">Bridging the gap</a></h2><p>Since long before I joined the team last June, Figma’s been working to create a tool that connects visual design to dynamic user interface design. So far, we’ve released:</p><ul><li>Reliable and intuitive vector editing</li><li>Constraints that map to system behavior</li><li>Reusable, dynamic components to help make high-level design systems feasible on a personal level</li></ul><p>Now, we’re releasing a beta of Team Libraries to make components usable across all of your files and team members.</p><p>Team Libraries are a perfect example of why we built Figma on the web. They let you create effective, scalable design systems by reusing shared, synchronized components across files and team members. This feature makes it easier and more efficient to build layouts with rules and structure, enabling faster design processes for a wide variety of devices and platforms. Because it’s always online, there’s effectively zero sync time across your files.</p><figure><figcaption>Team Libraries in Figma</figcaption></figure><h2 id="our-approach"><a href="#our-approach">Our Approach</a></h2><p>Just as systemic design has moved from being a “nice-to-have” to becoming a requirement in product design, the composition of applications from discrete, clearly-defined parts has become more popular in engineering, via frameworks like React. The product cycle benefits globally from a clearer, more maintainable structure, so we purposely enabled designers to benefit from that workflow in Figma.</p><p>Building programming principles into a design tool isn’t cut-and-dry, though. We know that many designers think differently than their technical teammates, so we took a few engineering concepts and refined them to make them more accessible.</p><h2 id="how-it-works"><a href="#how-it-works">How it works</a></h2><p>The core of the feature can be described in three simple steps: Publish, Insert, and Update.</p><h3 id="publish"><a href="#publish">Publish</a></h3><p>As you’re working in a design file and iterating through the latest swath of UI concepts, you’ll inevitably come to a point where a decision needs to be made about which of the many possible solutions is The One™.</p><p>When you finally get to that point:</p><ol><li>Select the component you want to make available in the team library by clicking the “Add to Library” button in the inspector sidebar.</li><li>Add as many components from the file as you like.</li><li>Review your changes and publish them to your team’s library.</li></ol><figure></figure><p>Separating the library from the source file allows you to manage permissions for who is able to change the source of truth for your design system. Only people with Edit permissions to the source file can modify your source components, but anyone with View access can use the published components from that file. So, now your Production Designers are the only ones who can edit the file with the final icon assets and your Brand Designers are the only group who can control your color documentation. Everyone else can use their work, but they can’t set the rules.</p><h3 id="insert"><a href="#insert">Insert</a></h3><p>Once you’ve added your components to your team’s library, they’re available to anyone who has permission to view the source file. The shared components can be inserted in any file by clicking the components tool in the toolbar and selecting the component(s) to be inserted.</p><p>You can even nest components and publish them to the team library. That way you can construct modules from individual source elements, then later reuse those modules across more complex views and flows in other files. Deeply-nested components make maintaining a single source of truth incredibly easy and predictable.</p><figure></figure><h3 id="update"><a href="#update">Update</a></h3><p>What happens when your brand guidelines change and assets need to be updated? Simply make the changes inside the existing component and publish it again. You’ll get a confirmation step, just like when you added them to the team library in the first place and you’ll see a nice visual diff of what changed from the last version. If you delete a component in the source file and publish those changes, you’ll see that component disappear from the team library as well, so only the current parts of your design system are shared with your team.</p><p>Being able to change a component in the team library could be problematic when the component is being used in different UI explorations, so we built in an extra step to make sure you don’t lose work. When a change is published to a component you’re using in a different file, you’ll see a notification alerting you to the update. You can choose whether or not to accept it, and if you decide not to you can update it later through the team library.</p><figure></figure><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2><p>By creating a design system that is clear and rule-driven, your UI components can be built and maintained in their simplest possible form and any updates will be applied in way that is predictable and cascade throughout the rest of your system.</p><p>We’re launching this as a beta feature today because we want to get it out into the world to start honing it based on user feedback as fast as possible. You can try out Team Libraries at Figma.com right now — just make a component and hit ‘Add to Library’!</p><p>We’d love to hear what you think and how we can make this even better for you and your workflow.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Components in Figma</title>

      <description>Today we are excited to release Components in Figma.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today we are excited to release Components in Figma. By bringing concepts like composition, inheritance and unlimited overrides from engineering to design, Components move us closer to a world where we are able to easily reason about design systems as we go about our day to day work.</p><p>We kicked off the project of building Components almost a year ago. As someone who comes from a background in both design and engineering, I’ve noticed the way we design is very different than the way we build software. People expect complex user interfaces that are alive, connected and always improving. How can we keep up as designers? Engineers have already figured this out.</p><p>Components are a popular concept in engineering used in everything from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiview">iOS</a>, <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html">Android</a>, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/reference/appkit/nsview">macOS</a>, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb613551.aspx">Windows</a>, <a href="https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/user-interface-ui">Unity</a>, <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#elements">HTML</a> and other technologies used for actually building user interfaces and games. <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> for instance is a way of building large UI systems without the headache of needing to understand everything at once, through composition of smaller parts into more complex behavior.</p><p>What if we applied this concept to design tools?</p><figure><figcaption>Throwback to the olden days; Components in action — Open in Figma</figcaption></figure><h2 id="designing-with-components"><a href="#designing-with-components">Designing with Components</a></h2><p>Composition is a foundational part of design. It allows us to reason about a smaller part of a greater system and enables us to reuse existing parts saving us time on otherwise repetitive and tedious work. Adding the concept of components to a design tool makes the composition of complex designs more consistent and more efficient.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7d3bc6adb6a9372ec674f8a17376de69633d6c7d-800x163.png?rect=1,0,797,163&amp;w=670&amp;h=137&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7d3bc6adb6a9372ec674f8a17376de69633d6c7d-800x163.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7d3bc6adb6a9372ec674f8a17376de69633d6c7d-800x163.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7d3bc6adb6a9372ec674f8a17376de69633d6c7d-800x163.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/7d3bc6adb6a9372ec674f8a17376de69633d6c7d-800x163.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 797w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>For instance, an address–book app might have a table which lists one contact per row. Designing a good list view requires finding the right type size, spacing, icons and other graphics. The same component can be used in many places at once, each at a different size with local modifications and differences:</p><figure></figure><p>Not only does this make it easier to reuse existing parts quickly but components also help with consistency. And since reused components are not copies, but <em>instances</em> of the same component, any changes applied later are immediately reflected across your design.</p><h2 id="our-approach-to-components"><a href="#our-approach-to-components">Our Approach to Components</a></h2><p>At Figma, we believe that design tools should not get in the way of your creative work. Many tools have tried to tackle the problem of reusable design, but we believe our implementation is different.</p><p>When designing Components, our goal was to make them:</p><ul><li><em>easy to learn</em> for anyone to get started</li><li><em>powerful</em> enough for advanced users</li><li><em>flexible</em> enough to work throughout the design process</li></ul><p>Designing systematically shouldn’t slow you down — it shouldn’t require more overhead. It should allow you to build things faster and more consistently, without blocking your ability to be creative and solve new problems.</p><h2 id="how-it-works"><a href="#how-it-works">How it works</a></h2><p>In Figma, Components works just like <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039832054-Frames-and-Groups">Frames</a>, with the twist that duplicates of a component creates new instances rather than copies. We start out by selecting something that we want to make into a component and click the “Create Component” action in the toolbar:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f0d2500b96b01cafd9dd55c0039be8a88e52342-800x266.png?rect=0,0,799,266&amp;w=670&amp;h=223&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f0d2500b96b01cafd9dd55c0039be8a88e52342-800x266.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f0d2500b96b01cafd9dd55c0039be8a88e52342-800x266.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f0d2500b96b01cafd9dd55c0039be8a88e52342-800x266.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/9f0d2500b96b01cafd9dd55c0039be8a88e52342-800x266.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>At this point it’s just a Frame with a fancy purple outline. Well, until we create some <em>instances</em>.</p><p>We can hold the alt-key and drag, use the “Duplicate” action, or simply copy-and paste a Component to create instances:</p><figure></figure><p>With two instances, we now have three of the same thing. Each has an independent position on the canvas, but are otherwise identical.</p><p>Any change we make to our Component is immediately reflected in its instances:</p><figure></figure><p>There’s one important aspect that makes instances special: they are reflections of the component they represent and allow overrides to various properties, but restrict a few properties like position and size of objects inside, all to make it as easy as possible to manage and maintain Components.</p><p>Since any change to a Component is reflected in an instance, what happens if we change something inside an instance? Does that change simply disappear when the Component is modified? No, that’d be crazy.</p><h2 id="style-and-property-overrides"><a href="#style-and-property-overrides">Style and Property Overrides</a></h2><p>Changes made to instances can be thought of as <em>overrides</em> of the original Component’s style and properties. Let’s see what happens if we override the color and stroke in our instances, and then change the original Component:</p><figure></figure><p>What happens here is that we said “for this particular instance, let the fill color be dark grey, and for this one let the color and width of the stroke be red and 6px, no matter what the values are for the original component.” When we later make changes to the Component, our overrides remain, but other properties which we didn’t override are reflected verbatim.</p><p>Any property of any part of an instance can be overridden, including any sublayers and their properties. This makes the possibilities virtually endless.</p><p>When we change our minds and want to clear the overrides from our instances, we can simply select the things we want to reset and choose “Reset Instance.”</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c6ae0d21019cb214134a5c4f2295af536c537ad4-800x85.png?w=670&amp;h=71&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c6ae0d21019cb214134a5c4f2295af536c537ad4-800x85.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c6ae0d21019cb214134a5c4f2295af536c537ad4-800x85.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c6ae0d21019cb214134a5c4f2295af536c537ad4-800x85.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c6ae0d21019cb214134a5c4f2295af536c537ad4-800x85.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 800w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="complex-components"><a href="#complex-components">Complex components</a></h2><p>Earlier in this article we spoke about creating systems out of easily-comprehensible components and that components can contain other instances to form more complex behavior. Such “nested components” are as easy to create and work with any other object in Figma. Simply add an instance into a component, or create a new component from one or more selected instances:</p><figure></figure><h2 id="constraints"><a href="#constraints">Constraints</a></h2><p>Figma is powerful in the way we can combine several features together. <a href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039957734">Constraints</a> is one of these features that when added to a design, allows a whole new dimension of creative expression, especially in how things react to various sizes and positions:</p><figure><figcaption>Open in Figma</figcaption></figure><p><em>Read more about Constraints in <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/grid-systems-for-screen-design/">Grid Systems for Screen Design</a></em></p><p>This release of Components is just the beginning for us, but it is the foundation for a series of steps we are taking to bring design closer to engineering. As design becomes more complex and more people become involved in the design process, it will be even more essential that our tools become smarter and help us do work that can be automated so we can focus on solving design problems.

      <title>Delete and Heal for Vector Networks</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/delete-and-heal-for-vector-networks/</link>
      <description>Since I joined Figma in September, among many other things, I had the pleasure of working on the intuitive yet surprisingly complex behavior you see above (You might need to give it a second to load the GIF).</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption>Option-click to delete and heal a vertex with the pen tool, Shift+Delete to delete and heal all selected vertices and edges</figcaption></figure><p>Since I joined <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> in September, among many other things, I had the pleasure of working on the intuitive yet surprisingly complex behavior you see above (You might need to give it a second to load the GIF).</p><p>When implementing deletion of a vertex in a vector editing tool, the easiest thing to do is look at all the edges that touch that vertex and delete them too. If there are any fills touching those removed edges, throw those out too.</p><p>The distinction between “delete” and “delete and heal” is, as you might expect, the “heal” part. At first glance, this operation might seem like it has a straightforward implementation: join up the two vertices in the path that are adjacent to the deleted vertex.</p><figure><figcaption>Delete and heal on simple open paths (left) and closed paths (right)</figcaption></figure><p>Even in these simple examples, you start to run into edge cases. What happens if the vertex only touches one edge? In that case, you throw away the edge, since there’s no sensible “healing” action. What happens when you have a triangle and delete and heal one of the vertices? You have two vertices now, but should you be left with one edge or two? Figma’s answer is, well, it depends.</p><figure><figcaption>The example on the left collapses to a single edge, but the example on the right doesn’t, despite both having 3 vertices.</figcaption></figure><p>All the examples so far, while a little tricky, come mostly down to finding the edge cases and dealing with them sensibly. The problem gets <em>really</em> interesting once you consider how to deal with healing vertices along curved paths.</p><h2 id="healing-curves"><a href="#healing-curves">Healing Curves</a></h2><p>When you delete a vertex along a curved path, we try to do our best to retain the curvature without that vertex.</p><figure><figcaption>Retaining approximate curvature when deleting vertices on curved paths</figcaption></figure><p>There’s some subtlety here. Other tools typically preserve the position of the curvature control handles on the adjacent vertices when doing their equivalent delete and heal operation. Figma adjusts the adjacent control handles to approximate the original curvature. The above animation zips through this, so let’s look at the before and after picture.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d67e1cfd563692e31a8e07aea99df3de173053e8-1753x892.png?w=670&amp;h=341&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d67e1cfd563692e31a8e07aea99df3de173053e8-1753x892.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d67e1cfd563692e31a8e07aea99df3de173053e8-1753x892.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d67e1cfd563692e31a8e07aea99df3de173053e8-1753x892.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d67e1cfd563692e31a8e07aea99df3de173053e8-1753x892.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d67e1cfd563692e31a8e07aea99df3de173053e8-1753x892.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The original curvature is approximated by moving the handles on the adjacent vertices</figcaption></figure><p>Since the original endpoint vertices have no control handles, if we didn’t do this, the “After” picture would be a straight line.</p><p>Each curved segment is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bézier_curve#Cubic_B.C3.A9zier_curves">cubic bezier curve</a>.

How do we best approximate the joint bezier curves ((P0, P1, P2, P3), (P3, P4, P5, P6)) with a single curve (P’0, P’1, P’2, P’3)? We don’t want to change the rest of the vector network, so we’ll keep P’0 = P0, and P’3 = P6. The problem is reduced further to determining P’1 and P’2 as a function of P0–6.</p><p>We solve this by first generating a series of points that lie along the joint bezier curves, and then fitting a cubic bezier curve to those points.</p><p>Generating a list of points along the cubic bezier curve ends up being quite simple.

This generates 7 unique points, because B(1) for the first curve will be equal to B(0) for the second curve — this is the shared endpoint between the two original curves.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60698caad8763e4af3d63ed1a0a44a84b0f53aba-1440x734.png?rect=1,0,1438,734&amp;w=670&amp;h=342&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60698caad8763e4af3d63ed1a0a44a84b0f53aba-1440x734.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60698caad8763e4af3d63ed1a0a44a84b0f53aba-1440x734.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60698caad8763e4af3d63ed1a0a44a84b0f53aba-1440x734.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60698caad8763e4af3d63ed1a0a44a84b0f53aba-1440x734.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/60698caad8763e4af3d63ed1a0a44a84b0f53aba-1440x734.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>7 generated points along the joint bezier curve</figcaption></figure><p>Once we have these points, we use a technique described by Philip J.

Conveniently, the <a href="https://github.com/erich666/GraphicsGems/blob/master/gems/FitCurves.c">original associated code is available on GitHub</a>.</p><h2 id="vector-networks"><a href="#vector-networks">Vector Networks</a></h2><p>The vector networks we use at Figma to represent vector objects present challenges you avoid when using paths. If you’ve never seen vector networks before, or if you’re curious why we chose this more complex representation, you might find <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-vector-networks/">Introducing Vector Networks</a> of interest (spoiler: they’re more intuitive to use). For the computer scientists and engineers reading, all you need to understand is that, unlike other vector editing tools, Figma considers vector objects as undirected graphs (or more precisely, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multigraph#Undirected_multigraph_.28edges_with_own_identity.29">undirected multigraphs with edge identity</a>), not as paths of vertices.</p><p>This means that “delete and heal” in Figma has to work correctly in situations that other programs don’t need to consider at all. The most obvious is that a deleted vertex might be an endpoint of more than 2 edges. What do you do then?</p><p>If there are an odd number of edges, there’s no sensible resolution, so we delete all of the incident edges. For an even number however, something like this happens:</p><figure></figure><p>Edges are healed by replacing pairs of “opposite” edges with a new edge. But how to define “opposite”?</p><p>For now, let’s ignore that the incident edges might be curved. The trick here is to sort the incident edges by angle. Let’s look at a concrete example.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82c21dd5164f9c8499b4ceda18a74fceca3b5a63-879x581.png?w=670&amp;h=443&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82c21dd5164f9c8499b4ceda18a74fceca3b5a63-879x581.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82c21dd5164f9c8499b4ceda18a74fceca3b5a63-879x581.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82c21dd5164f9c8499b4ceda18a74fceca3b5a63-879x581.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/82c21dd5164f9c8499b4ceda18a74fceca3b5a63-879x581.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 879w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>The task at hand is deleting and healing vertex c. First, we find all the edges incident to c: <code>[{a, c}, {b, c}, {c, d}, {c, e}]</code>. The ordering of the two values here is undefined, since vector networks are undirected graphs. To sort them, we use the angle from the deleted vertex to the non-deleted vertex as the key.</p><p>For example, the key for <code>{a, c}</code>:</p><div><pre><code><span>angle from c to a
</span>= atan2(a.y - c.y, a.x - c.x)
= atan2(2 - 3, 2 - 2)
= atan2(-1, 0)
= -PI/2
</code></pre></div><p>This is one of those situations where <a href="https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/atan2/">atan2</a> comes in handy, since we need the full [-𝜋, 𝜋] range to use as our sorting keys. Applying this to all of our edges, we get the following sorted list of edges with their angles:</p><div><pre><code><span>sorted_edges = [(-PI/2, {a, c}),
</span>                (    0, {c, d}),
                ( PI/2, {c, e}),
                (   PI, {b, c})]
</code></pre></div><p>To find pairs of edges to be collapsed into a single edge, we pair <code>sorted_edges[i]</code> with <code>sorted_edges[(i + sorted_edges.size() / 2) % sorted_edges.size)]</code>, since that’s its angular “opposite”. Once we have these pairs, collapsing them down becomes the same problem as it was with deleting a vertex with two incident edges.</p><h2 id="sorting-curved-edges"><a href="#sorting-curved-edges">Sorting Curved Edges</a></h2><p>The situation for sorting gets a little weirder when the edges are curved. Using the angle to the non-deleted vertex doesn’t work in cases like this:</p><figure></figure><p>The example on the right shows a surprising fact: vector networks can have multiple edges joining 2 vertices! This is what makes vector networks not just a graph, but a <em>multigraph</em>. If we try to sort by the angle to the non-deleted endpoint vertex, then we’d get the same key for the top two curved edges. The intuitive behavior here is pretty clear: in the figure eight, we want to joint the top left edge to the bottom right edge.</p><p>Instead of using the angle from the deleted vertex to the non-deleted vertex, we use the angle of the <em>tangent vector</em> to sort. So for each cubic bezier curve (P0, P1, P2, P3) attached to the deleted vertex P0, we use the angle of the curve as it leaves P0 (usually the angle from P0 to P1), not the angle from P0 to P3 like we did in the previous section.</p><h2 id="region-healing"><a href="#region-healing">Region Healing</a></h2><p>The last piece of this puzzle has to do with regions. Since vector networks might have many closed regions, we start with the entire closed part of the network filled in, then let people punch holes in the fill.</p><figure></figure><p>My intuition was that each region is defined by the list of edges that bound it, until I was presented with pictures that look like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40614888c04bae5c2a25a738a6cfb7848c8469eb-874x443.png?rect=1,0,873,443&amp;w=670&amp;h=340&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40614888c04bae5c2a25a738a6cfb7848c8469eb-874x443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40614888c04bae5c2a25a738a6cfb7848c8469eb-874x443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40614888c04bae5c2a25a738a6cfb7848c8469eb-874x443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/40614888c04bae5c2a25a738a6cfb7848c8469eb-874x443.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 873w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>How would you describe the filled in regions in these two examples? The filled region is defined as the area between two closed paths in the left case, and between <em>four</em> closed paths in the right case!</p><p>In Figma, each region is defined by a list of “loops”, where each loop is an ordered list of edges that define the curve as clockwise or counter-clockwise. This list of loops is used in combination with a winding rule (either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonzero-rule">nonzero</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even–odd_rule">even-odd</a>) to unambiguously define the region.</p><p>In our implementation of delete and heal, we try to heal any loops containing edges that were deleted by using the newly created edges.</p><figure><figcaption>Left: regions with 1 loop each being healed.

The healing operation adds the edge <code>{a, c}</code>, which we can then use to repair our loop!</p><p>Even after all of those cases, there are a bunch of things I left out.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We discovered an issue with saving in <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> back in June 2015 that turned out to be the hardest and least-satisfying bug I’ve ever tackled. Fixing it took two whole weeks and all I had to show for it at the end was <a href="https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/pull/227/files">a single three-line commit</a>! However, the journey to get there led me into the depths of our tech stack and makes for an interesting case study.</p><p>It all started when we noticed that our app generated invalid save files every now and then (files that couldn’t be read back in). As with all of our bugs, we first tried to find deterministic steps for reproducing the bug. No one could get it to happen reliably though. Our web app has several sources of non-determinism including asynchronous timers and network events, so this wasn’t too surprising.</p><p>The next step was to check the generated files themselves. At the time, our file format was a zip file that wrapped a document encoded using Google’s <a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">FlatBuffers</a> library. FlatBuffers is a schema-driven file format with zero-parsing overhead, meaning you can load the raw buffer and traverse the encoded object graph without having to run the parser over the entire file first. The bytes of the generated file looked reasonable but some of the offsets to data later on in the file were suspiciously zeroed out. Data being written out of place is usually a symptom of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_safety">memory safety violation</a>, which is when a C++ program reads or writes memory that it shouldn’t (use before initialization, use after free, out of bounds access, etc.).</p><p>I have a love-hate relationship with C++, the language that Figma’s editor is written in. There’s a good reason why most graphics software is written in C++: it’s an incredibly practical choice. It lets us rely on important third-party libraries (<a href="https://www.freetype.org/">FreeType</a>, <a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/HarfBuzz/">HarfBuzz</a>, <a href="https://skia.org/">Skia</a>, etc.), it contains many low-level language features that have a direct translation to the underlying hardware, existing debugging tools are very mature and sophisticated, and the optimization toolchain contains literally centuries of person-effort. Despite its benefits however, C++ is a perfect storm of poor language design decisions, an error-prone standard library API, and legacy from C which together make it impossible to completely avoid accidentally introducing memory safety violations in large projects.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?rect=1,0,1397,342&amp;w=670&amp;h=164&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c2cd2d14296709fc62fc4f8df37c554758b60f85-1400x342.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>An example real-world memory safety violation in Chrome (“OnClose” likely removes the stream, which invalidates “it”)</figcaption></figure><p>The C++ language doesn’t have any safeguards against these errors whatsoever, so the C++ community has instead provided tools that attempt to detect these problems. I tried all of the usual tricks without success:</p><ul><li>Try never releasing any memory to avoid use-after-free errors</li><li>Run the app with all <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/ManagingMemory/Articles/MallocDebug.html">malloc debugging options</a> enabled</li><li>Fix all issues reported by <a href="https://valgrind.org/">valgrind</a></li><li>Upgrade the compiler just in case</li><li>Fix all issues reported by the <a href="https://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/">clang analyzer</a></li></ul><p>At this point we were getting desperate, but there was one thing left to try to deterministically reproduce the bug: eliminate all sources of non-determinism, create some way of recording user events, and keep recording sessions until the bug happens. Then you have a sequence of events that can be played back in order and the bug should reproduce itself every time. You can even create a reduced test case by randomly dropping events as long as they don’t cause the bug to disappear.</p><p>Adding a system like this onto an existing app is a big project because real user sessions have all sorts of events. To limit the scope, we decided to restrict recording to just keyboard and mouse events and use a <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Fuzzing">fuzzer</a> (a program that feeds random inputs to another program) to automatically generate sessions containing only those events instead of trying to record actual users. And it worked! Running the fuzzer for a few days came up with a handful of save failures. Then came the hard part: debugging.</p><figure><figcaption>Our primitive fuzzer spamming the app with synthesized keyboard and mouse events</figcaption></figure><p>Figma is a web app that runs natively in the browser without plugins. We’re using a compiler called <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a> to compile C++ to JavaScript. This may at first seem impossible since JavaScript is a memory-safe garbage-collected scripting language, but the introduction of WebGL to the web platform accidentally also made it possible to emulate the C memory model directly in JavaScript. WebGL added an API called <a href="https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webgl/typed_arrays/">Typed Arrays</a> to allow JavaScript to efficiently manipulate contiguous arrays of vertex data, but they were so useful that they were broken out into <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/latest/">their own specification</a>.</p><p>A typed array is an array with a fixed size where all elements must have the same type. For example, every element of a Uint8Array must be an integer from 0 to 255. The critical feature of typed arrays that makes C++ emulation possible is the ability to have multiple typed arrays share the same backing ArrayBuffer. This means the four bytes of element 2 in a Float32Array can be read as elements 8 to 11 of a Uint8Array that shares the same backing store:</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d59bee18c4759abe2dd64a3d262124d5fd801889-1400x340.png?rect=1,0,1398,340&amp;w=670&amp;h=163&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d59bee18c4759abe2dd64a3d262124d5fd801889-1400x340.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d59bee18c4759abe2dd64a3d262124d5fd801889-1400x340.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d59bee18c4759abe2dd64a3d262124d5fd801889-1400x340.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d59bee18c4759abe2dd64a3d262124d5fd801889-1400x340.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/d59bee18c4759abe2dd64a3d262124d5fd801889-1400x340.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Multiple typed arrays can share the same backing array buffer</figcaption></figure><p>When emscripten emulates C++, pointer loads become typed array reads, pointer stores become typed array writes, registers become local variables, and so on.

It’s using asm.js, a restrictive subset of JavaScript that’s designed to help the JIT run code as fast as possible.</p><p>Things to notice about the code sample shown above:</p><ul><li><code>$value = +$value</code> tells the JIT to assume that $value is a double. Most modern JITs use this information to omit type checks in the generated code.</li><li>Stack space is reserved using the “stack pointer” called STACKTOP. Addition is done using a bitwise-or operator because that allows the JIT to use integer wraparound semantics instead of having to generate additional checks and deoptimization points in case the addition overflows outside signed 32-bit range.</li><li>Math_imul is a special function created for asm.js that can multiply two 32-bit numbers and return the lower 32-bit half of the 64-bit result (basically mapping to the x86 “imul” instruction). Normal JavaScript multiplication operates on 64-bit doubles, which <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1848700">don’t have enough precision</a> to hold the full 64-bit integer multiplication result.</li><li>The loop was unrolled! The emscripten compiler is actually just a <a href="https://llvm.org/devmtg/2013-11/slides/Zakai-Emscripten.pdf">backend for LLVM</a>. C++ is still compiled with clang and benefits from almost all of the same optimizations available to native code targets.</li><li>Pointers must be divided by the element size, which is why the write to <code>value</code> turns into a write to <code>HEAPF32[$0 &gt;&gt; 2]</code>. A right shift is used instead of a division so the JIT can use a single hardware instruction instead of needing to convert the result to a double and deal with fractional indices returning “undefined”.</li></ul><p>That last point actually turned out to be relevant to this bug. An <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/unaligned-memory-access.txt">unaligned load or store</a> is when you try to access memory at an address that’s not divisible by the element size (for example, attempting to load an int from a pointer that’s not a multiple of 4). They are undefined behavior in C++, which means the compiler is allowed to do whatever it wants. Sometimes it just works and sometimes it causes a bus error. In emscripten’s case, the right shift operator effectively rounds the pointer down to the closest valid value, so the load or store is actually done somewhere else!</p><p>The emscripten compiler has a debugging option called <a href="https://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/porting/Debugging.html#debugging-safe-heap">SAFE_HEAP</a> to instrument your code with checks for this and sure enough, turning it on showed an unaligned store inside the FlatBuffers library. Finally! I <a href="https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/226">filed an issue</a> with the FlatBuffers library and tried everything I could think of to fix it including:</p><ul><li>Putting <code>__attribute__((aligned(1)))</code> everywhere. This didn’t work due to <a href="https://clang-developers.42468.n3.nabble.com/Unaligned-loads-td2755128.html">LLVM bugs</a>.</li><li>Using memcpy everywhere to avoid unaligned loads and stores. This didn’t work because LLVM tries to be clever and change constant-size memcpy calls into aligned loads and stores.</li><li>Using a custom memcpy everywhere implemented using the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3604569">volatile</a> keyword to avoid LLVM optimizations. This didn’t work because FlatBuffers hands out raw pointers, which makes tracking down all access points in existing code very tricky.</li></ul><p>I finally gave up and tried fixing the FlatBuffers library itself. This involved digging through emscripten’s extremely verbose generated code and mapping it back to the original C++ code. This can be challenging to say the least, especially when functions have been inlined and nested compound objects have been flattened into array accesses. The problem ended up being in the reallocation code for the main buffer that FlatBuffers grows as it writes out a file. The buffer is filled back-to-front so that the last object written out can be the first object read back in. Attempting to grow the buffer by an odd size caused unaligned accesses for data already in the buffer. <a href="https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/pull/227">The fix</a> was really small: just round the growth amount up to the size of a pointer.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/532a8b4a8c077eda8f816ef633c2099ee54e37c1-1400x436.png?rect=1,0,1398,436&amp;w=670&amp;h=209&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/532a8b4a8c077eda8f816ef633c2099ee54e37c1-1400x436.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/532a8b4a8c077eda8f816ef633c2099ee54e37c1-1400x436.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/532a8b4a8c077eda8f816ef633c2099ee54e37c1-1400x436.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/532a8b4a8c077eda8f816ef633c2099ee54e37c1-1400x436.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/532a8b4a8c077eda8f816ef633c2099ee54e37c1-1400x436.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The fix to avoid unaligned loads and stores</figcaption></figure><p>And there you have it!

      <title>Multiplayer Editing in Figma</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/multiplayer-editing-in-figma/</link>
      <description>Today’s public release of Figma contains two long-awaited changes.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today’s public release of <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> contains two long-awaited changes. First, Figma is now open for anyone to sign up and try out! We’ve spent our <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-meet-the-internet/">preview release</a> tuning and shaping the product based on user feedback, and we now feel that Figma meets our quality bar for a professional design tool. I’m incredibly grateful to everyone who was part of our preview release program; your feedback was amazing and has helped more than you know. We couldn’t have done it without you.</p><p>Second, the real-time collaborative editing feature that we’ve been working hard on over the past year is finally ready! Our implementation is called “multiplayer” since it was inspired by cooperative multiplayer games. We’ve found that multiplayer automatically improves many aspects of design in elegant and natural ways. You don’t have to worry about editing the wrong version, coordinating with others to avoid overwriting their work, or dealing with conflicts from your files living inside a separate syncing service. When you look at something it’s guaranteed to be up to date. Working remotely, sharing files, and reviewing designs are all faster and less frustrating. After living with multiplayer for a few months here at Figma, it’s already a core part of our design workflow.</p><h2 id="in-the-beginning-it-was-simple-sort-of"><a href="#in-the-beginning-it-was-simple-sort-of">In the beginning it was simple… sort of</a></h2><p>Figma didn’t start out with multiplayer editing support. We initially focused on making sure the product worked well for individual users before we tackled teams of people working together. Our first saving model involved downloading the document, editing it locally in the browser, and uploading the whole document again periodically as you edit. It was a practical first approach; easy to build, easy to understand, and easy to iterate on top of in order to quickly get people using Figma for real work. Editing locally is also similar to how many designers collaborate over syncing services such as Dropbox today so we figured it would also feel familiar.</p><p>However, as time went on and we started adding more team features, it was clear that something was wrong. Every single save was recorded in the version history so data was never lost, but people would sometimes save over each other without realizing it. Other times people would share a link to their document with a collaborator but they would see the old version because we hadn’t finished saving yet. It turns out “easy to understand” wasn’t true after all. Our simple approach to saving was fundamentally incompatible with a collaborative environment.</p><p>Even though we knew the optimal solution to these problems was simultaneous editing, we were still hesitant. Building multiplayer would be a huge technological investment, require a lot of time and resources, and involve changing the core fundamentals of the editor itself. We explored cheaper alternatives including a “baton-passing” mode where there was only one active editor at a time, but nothing else had the simplicity and elegance we were going for. Today our year-long investment in multiplayer has finally paid off. Collaboration in Figma now feels right!</p><figure><figcaption>Multiplayer in action</figcaption></figure><h2 id="and-then-things-got-a-little-complicated"><a href="#and-then-things-got-a-little-complicated">And then things got a little complicated</a></h2><p>The idea behind our multiplayer engine is simple in theory. Changes from each user are sent up to the server and broadcast to other users in real-time. Two simultaneous changes are independent unless they affect the same property on the same object, in which case we pick the latest change. Theory never holds up in practice though, and sure enough we ran into lots of unexpected technical problems along the way.</p><p>Undo history has a natural definition for single-player mode, but undo in a multiplayer environment is inherently confusing. If other people have edited the same objects that you edited and then undo, what should happen? Should your earlier edits be applied over their later edits? What about redo? We had a lot of trouble until we settled on a principle to help guide us: if you undo a lot, copy something, and redo back to the present (a common operation), the document should not change. This may seem obvious but the single-player implementation of redo means “put back what I did” which may end up overwriting what other people did next if you’re not careful.</p><p>There were also quite a few technical challenges with the conflict resolution algorithm. Sometimes different properties on the same object had to be changed together, which meant a change to any one of those properties would have to be carefully merged with a change to any of the other ones. Other times a seemingly simple action on one object actually affected certain other objects too so users editing two seemingly unrelated objects would cause unintentional conflicts. This required changing some of how our layout features work.</p><p>It probably goes without saying but performance was a big challenge too. A professional-quality multiplayer implementation involved a lot of measurement and tuning, including overhauling our file format because the old format wasn’t efficient enough for small message sizes. There are also many more upcoming multiplayer challenges around new features in the pipeline. But it’s worth it. Software is becoming more connected and collaborative, and design software should be no exception.</p><h2 id="and-now-it-just-feels-right"><a href="#and-now-it-just-feels-right">…and now it just feels right</a></h2><p>Multiplayer editing feels like a natural extension of single-player editing. Introducing multiplayer actually reduced the overall complexity of Figma’s UX because it removed all of the awkward workflows that people had been using to work around the lack of multiplayer. The result is a few simple features that combine in powerful ways to provide a great collaborative editing experience.</p><p>The first thing you’ll notice when you edit something alongside someone else is their mouse cursor. We show the cursor and selection of all active participants because it provides important context. Who else is here? Where are they working? Cursors can come in handy for other things too, such as waving your cursor around to get someone’s attention or placing your cursor by an object to point at it.</p><figure><figcaption>Two users editing simultaneously</figcaption></figure><p>Every user in the document gets an avatar in the top right corner. In addition to showing who’s present, avatars are also useful for presentations. Clicking on someone’s avatar means they are presenting to you. We initially tried making presentation mode mandatory by enforcing that there was one presenter per document and that all viewers had to follow along with the presentation, but that felt wrong. This way presentations are opt-in so you can temporarily disable it, go look at something else, and then return to the presentation without interrupting anyone else.</p><figure><figcaption>Presentation mode in action</figcaption></figure><p>Multiplayer editing isn’t just for collaboration between different people. It’s also for collaboration with yourself! Once we had multiplayer working it was trivial to use it for live broadcasting your edits to all of your mobile devices as you work. Figma’s live device preview app can be <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/figma-mirror/id1152747299">downloaded today from the iOS app store</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Figma Mirror updating in real-time</figcaption></figure><p>We’ve included access controls from the start so multiplayer doesn’t distract from Figma’s fantastic single-player editing experience. You have total control over when and how you use multiplayer. Newly-created personal files start off in a space that’s only accessible to you. From the “Share” button you can grant viewer and editor permissions when you’re ready to share it. Figma supports setting these permissions both on an individual file and an entire project.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670&amp;h=287&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/09c7ac08cb5143d7c706bf4958336aaec378ce1a-1400x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><h2 id="try-it"><a href="#try-it">Try it!</a></h2><p>Building our multiplayer editing engine and making it a core part of Figma was an immense technical challenge, but we made the investment because we firmly believe that this is the future of design tools.

      <title>Introducing Figma’s Integration with Framer</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-figmas-integration-with-framer/</link>
      <description>Today I’m excited to announce Figma is integrating with Framer!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today I’m excited to announce Figma is integrating with Framer! After releasing Figma in beta last December, our top request has been adding support for various prototyping tools. Of these tools, we hear the most demand for Framer.</p><h2 id="why-prototyping"><a href="#why-prototyping">Why prototyping?</a></h2><p>With the proliferation of mobile, designing static mockups on a 27” Thunderbolt display doesn’t cut it anymore. For designers to create the best possible experience, they need the ability to do three things:</p><ol><li>Design specifically for the context in which work will be viewed.</li><li>Communicate the end user’s experience by showing how a screen changes based on input.</li><li>Add transitions and moments of joy to their design through motion graphics.</li></ol><p>These are pain points I’ve experienced myself. Before Evan and I started Figma, I worked on the design team at Flipboard. When I was there in 2012 meeting the needs outlined above was a huge burden; we would either use video editing products like After Effects or build out a full prototype in HTML / JS / CSS, save to a remote server via FTP then load the prototype on a mobile phone over 3G. This workflow was cumbersome and inefficient, less about creative intent and more about working around various browser consistency issues.</p><p>Since then designers have demanded a better workflow. In response, an entirely new market of prototyping tools has emerged. It seems like a new prototyping tool launches every week. However, Figma users consistently and constantly request integration with one specifically: Framer.</p><p>The integration that launches today simplifies workflows by allowing users to import Figma assets while working in Framer with one click rather than having to export layer-by-layer and then upload to Framer.</p><p>Here’s what is looks like:</p><figure></figure><h2 id="working-with-framer"><a href="#working-with-framer">Working with Framer</a></h2><p>When exploring a Framer integration, we talked with a few of our users about why they wanted this functionality. Circle designer Jonathan Simcoe explained it best:</p><div><blockquote><p>“Since Framer is based in code I have found it to be the most expressive way to prototype. It is entirely open-ended. Framer especially excels at complex, single-page interactions. Figma has been instrumental for our team in designing and iterating on UI quickly. Framer is the best way to prototype. An integration allows us to get our UI ideas into code quickly, test them, and ship faster and better.”</p></blockquote></div><p>We think it is awesome how Framer is making code-based prototyping accessible to an entire generation of designers. We know Koen, Jorn, and the Framer team well and we are thrilled to be working with them to make our users lives easier. We can’t wait to see what our users will create with Figma and Framer!</p><p>PS: Figma is still in Private Release, but if you tweet at us we will prioritize your access.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That was a broad overview of how it improved our collaboration and gave content design a better seat at the table. But I wanted to go a bit deeper with this post and describe how to actually do content design using the tool.</p><p>Because Figma is web-based, you’re never writing in a silo. Your team can click the design URL to observe you working in real-time, see the notes you leave yourself around key content decisions and adapt their work to yours (and vice versa). This empowers everyone to do better work and brings content firmly into the game.</p><div><blockquote><p>Designing content in non-collaborative tools is like a football team training independently, then coming together on match day &amp; hoping everything slots together</p></blockquote></div><p>This post features 5 lessons to help you make the most of this new way of designing.

Your role is to ensure that users can complete their tasks as simply and effectively as possible.</p><p>With that in mind, as soon as any UI is created in Figma (whether it’s a screen, modal or the tiniest interaction) put some <em>real content</em> in there. Or as close to real content as you can get. You can iterate later… <strong>This is especially important if you weren’t involved from the outset</strong> because it will help you spot ineffective UI as early as possible. If the UI confuses the message you need to communicate or simply doesn’t have space for the content, then it needs a re-think.</p><div><blockquote><p>You can design how the product looks and what it communicates hand-in-hand</p></blockquote></div><p>With many tools this is so difficult. Most of the time, you have to wait until the designer is done with their design file before taking a look. And if that one UI element isn’t working, it could have huge knock-on effects for the entire flow. So when you start designing the content and realize something isn’t working, there’s a ton of work to redo.</p><p>When you’re using Figma, a web-based tool, you can design how the product looks and what it communicates hand-in-hand. Content designers don’t have to do their job AFTER the UI has been defined. This way, there are fewer chances for designed content to break the interaction.</p><p>This brings me nicely onto lesson number 2. Use Figma to kickstart the content and get the UI spot on every time (nearly).</p><h2 id="_2-design-content-first-by-writing-out"><a href="#_2-design-content-first-by-writing-out">2.

Put any interaction back into the real-world and imagine you’re completing an action in person, then script it out.</p><p>You can do this directly in Figma by dedicating a frame to the conversation or using comments to script out the interaction with your team. This helps content and design stay aligned throughout the process.</p><div><blockquote><p>Role play user conversations in Figma frames to keep content and design aligned</p></blockquote></div><p>When I had to redesign the order tickets used by kitchen staff and delivery drivers, my product designer colleague and I scripted out several conversations straight into our Figma file before co-designing. One of us played the role of Deliveroo (the system) and the other, the user. We role-played the conversation to uncover the relevant information needed in order to do the jobs of our chosen role, in the order that seemed most natural.</p><p>This helped us do a number of additional things, all before anything was done visually:</p><ol><li>Identify goals and edge cases</li><li>Understand flow and hierarchy</li><li>Use human language, not system language</li></ol><p>When you do this, it might not become a perfect blueprint for what you’re about to design, but it’s an incredibly useful point of reference throughout the iteration process.</p><h2 id="_3-map-the-user-journey-in-figma"><a href="#_3-map-the-user-journey-in-figma">3.

You need to know what came before and what will come after to ensure you’re helping guide the user and set their expectations.</p><p>But sometimes content design isn’t considered until late on in the process, meaning you don’t always get visibility of user journeys or the bigger picture. These are often hidden (not deliberately) in slide decks or sketch files. Figma gives you the visibility and chance to contribute and collaborate from the off so grasp that opportunity with both hands.</p><p>Encourage your team to collaborate with Figma to map out those journeys and then map the content needs underneath so everyone can see them. This will nudge any visual exploration to start with the content.</p><div><blockquote><p>This is a great way of showing content’s impact throughout the entire user journey</p></blockquote></div><p>It’s a far more iterative process because you’re not restricted geographically like you are with a whiteboard or technically by non-collaborative tools. This is especially handy in a busy, remote working-friendly office like Deliveroo when surfaces have to be cleared after using them.</p><p>One particularly handy knock-on effect of this is the increase in exposure of your work as a content designer. When everyone (engineers, product owners, product designers) can see you working in real time in the shared Figma file you’re showing just how much thought goes into putting the right content in the right place at the right time.</p><p>As an often misunderstood role, this is a great way of showing off how much you make an impact throughout the entire journey.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8e73091be11f7c12c17bb5ae9db83004bdd0b97b-800x600.png?rect=0,0,799,600&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8e73091be11f7c12c17bb5ae9db83004bdd0b97b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8e73091be11f7c12c17bb5ae9db83004bdd0b97b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8e73091be11f7c12c17bb5ae9db83004bdd0b97b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/8e73091be11f7c12c17bb5ae9db83004bdd0b97b-800x600.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 799w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p></figure><p>One of our most important tasks is making our product content useful. But often being useful requires us changing how something works or even inventing a new way for something to work. This means close collaboration with an engineer.</p><p>As an example, earlier this year I wrote an error message that explained to the user that their printer wasn’t working because their Bluetooth wasn’t turned on.</p><p>I wanted to turn an <strong>“OK”</strong> CTA into a <strong>“Turn on Bluetooth”</strong> CTA — but could we actually turn on the Bluetooth from this error message?</p><div><blockquote><p>Loop in the engineer immediately just by tagging them in a comment in the design file</p></blockquote></div><p>It’s risky to assume anything and I didn’t want to go any further without the answer to the question above. Figma allowed me to loop in the engineer immediately just by tagging them in a comment in the design file. I could ask the question without disrupting their flow and get feedback about what was and wasn’t technically possible to help inform my design decisions.</p><p>Yes, this was always doable in Slack or in-person, but Figma keeps that record of your decision in the design file itself. Just by hitting ‘C’ on your keyboard you can see all the comments in the file. So you have a record of all the back and forth your team have had.</p><p>If my <strong>“Turn on Bluetooth”</strong> CTA wasn’t possible and someone was to revisit my work later on and question my decision, they’d have the reason right there without having to consult any other documentation.</p><div><blockquote><p>Just by hitting ‘C’ on your keyboard you can see all the comments in the file</p></blockquote></div><p>So when designing content use the comments to loop in those responsible for how the thing actually works and keep a track of your decision making.</p><h2 id="_5-empower-your-team-to-write-better-content"><a href="#_5-empower-your-team-to-write-better-content">5.

This way designers can create their own instances with some handy advice.

Prefix it with e.g.”</p><h3 id="and-if-you-don-t"><a href="#and-if-you-don-t">And if you don’t…</a></h3><p>Simply encourage anyone working on the file to channel their inner content designer rather than leave placeholders. This way you don’t have to be the bottleneck. You have access to the project so you can swoop in and finesse it later if you have the time. If there’s anything urgent or requires you specifically, you can be contacted via the comments.</p><svg width="93" height="13" fill="none" _key="jQZiorSbQJsp" _type="horizontalRule"><circle cx="6.5" cy="6.5" r="6.5" fill="#6A6A6A"></circle><path fill="#6A6A6A" d="M39.834 0h13v13h-13zM86.5 0L93 13H80l6.5-13z"></path></svg><p>One of the key differences between writers and content designers is that writing is possible solo, whereas designing content is a team sport. Designing content in non-collaborative tools is like a football team all training independently and then coming together on match day, hoping everything just slots together.</p><p>Figma gives you the playing field to test, experiment, iterate and design together all the time.

      <title>Introducing Vector Networks</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-vector-networks/</link>
      <description>Before I co-founded Figma my background was in game development, not in design.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before I co-founded Figma my background was in game development, not in design. I remember being very surprised when I first encountered modern vector editing tools. Many of the interactions felt broken. Why couldn’t you just manipulate things directly? Why did connecting and disconnecting stuff only sometimes work? Is this the best we can do?</p><p>The pen tool as we know it today was originally introduced in 1987 and has remained largely unchanged since then. We decided to try something new when we set out to build the vector editing toolset for Figma. Instead of using paths like other tools, Figma is built on something we’re calling vector networks which are backwards-compatible with paths but which offer much more flexibility and control:</p><figure></figure><h2 id="a-vector-network-in-action"><a href="#a-vector-network-in-action">A vector network in action</a></h2><p>After our first implementation of vector networks, we did a series of user studies to refine the concept. We were surprised to discover that many people didn’t even notice a difference between vector networks and paths. The tool just worked how people expected it to work. They did notice the difference when they went back and tried to use other tools, however. That was especially painful to watch and confirmed to us we had found something special.</p><h2 id="strokes"><a href="#strokes">Strokes</a></h2><p>To understand vector networks, it’s useful to first understand paths. A path is a chain of lines and curves from one endpoint to the other. You can think of a path as a sequence of instructions that a device like a pen plotter might follow. Put the pen down, drag it around, and lift it up.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?rect=1,0,1439,1080&amp;w=670&amp;h=503&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/04ac4318364884afd4e3e2a5b63d53426feae473-1440x1080.jpg?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Think of a pen plotter when thinking of paths (Photograph by Tomasz Sienicki)</figcaption></figure><p>A vector network improves on the path model by allowing lines and curves between any two points instead of requiring that they all join up to form a single chain. This helps provide the best of both worlds; it combines the ease with which points can be connected on paper and the ease with which geometry can be manipulated once it’s drawn. Splitting and recombining geometry is much more natural with vector networks. Delete anything, anywhere. Connect anything to anything else. Stroke cap and join styles just work naturally in vector networks, even for points with three or more lines coming off of them. This isn’t the case for paths because it’s impossible to use paths to represent attaching three lines together at a single point.</p><figure><figcaption>Vector networks support standard stroke cap and join styles</figcaption></figure><h2 id="bending"><a href="#bending">Bending</a></h2><p>Another way we wanted to improve over existing vector editing tools was to add support for direct manipulation. Vector graphics today are based on cubic bezier splines, which are curves with two extra points called control handles that are positioned away from the curve itself and that control how much it bends, sort of like how a magnet might bend a wire towards it. Changing the shape of a curve involves dragging a control handle off in space instead of dragging the curve directly.</p><p>We initially experimented with some powerful curve types that can provide greater control and shaping power, but in the end it made the most sense to remain backwards-compatible with existing vector data. That’s why both paths and vector networks use the same type of curves. In addition to dragging the control handles, Figma’s bend tool (the command key on OS X) lets you drag the curve around directly. The editor will automatically figure out where to place the control handles for you:</p><figure><figcaption>The bend tool drags curves around</figcaption></figure><h2 id="fills"><a href="#fills">Fills</a></h2><p>The other job of the vector engine is filling the area between curves with color. All current vector engines use a confusing concept called the winding number to fill the area between curves. It uses the number of times the path winds around a given location to decide whether that location is inside or outside the shape. The number depends on the direction in which you originally drew the curves (clockwise or counter-clockwise), which is especially counter-intuitive because no vector editor actually shows you the direction your curve is going in.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670&amp;h=373&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/78b89f00768673f18b6fa440258b47731ec448ec-1440x802.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>The non-zero winding rule means fill depends on curve orientation</figcaption></figure><p>Instead of using this confusing concept, fills in Figma start off by automatically filling all enclosed space:</p><figure><figcaption>Enclosed space is filled automatically</figcaption></figure><p>If you later want to add holes, just punch the holes out directly without needing to worry about curve orientation:</p><figure><figcaption>The paint bucket tool can toggle the fill for any enclosed region</figcaption></figure><p>Getting fills to work well was the hardest part. We tried a few different ways of representing fills but kept running into the problem of requiring the user to explicitly manipulate negative space to create holes, which was hard to wrap your head around. The tool to toggle regions on and off was the trick that finally made it work.</p><h2 id="vector-editing-revisited"><a href="#vector-editing-revisited">Vector Editing, Revisited</a></h2><p>Reinventing something as fundamental as paths was hard. The solution we came up with may seem obvious, but there were many dead ends and existential moments during development and many times where we considered cutting our losses and just doing paths even after all that work. There’s still lots more we’d like to do to make vector networks even better, but we’re satisfied with how vector networks turned out and we’re excited to get them in front of designers!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>How furniture making has influenced the design of Figma</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I studied Furniture Design at RISD before moving to the Bay Area to design the design tool now known as Figma.</p><p>When you ship furniture, you rarely have the chance to fix your mistakes. The design and execution need to be as close to perfect as possible. The digital world is different (duh, Pease) — you have daily opportunities to make improvements.</p><p>Furniture gives function to what is otherwise empty space. The primary purpose is to support the act of living, whatever that means for each user. Furniture itself is not the focus; the life you create around it is what matters.</p><p>The challenge of Figma is to design a product whose ultimate value is how well other people are able to design their own products. This means that Figma should fade away, and enable users to focus solely on their ideas.</p><p>Here are a few ways furniture design principles have influenced the way I’ve gone about designing Figma over the past two years:</p><p>It is possible to do a lot with a very basic toolset. A hammer can be used to build a small cabinet or an entire house. With Figma, we’ve tried to whittle down our primary drawing tools to the most foundational yet versatile set, tools that are well-equipped for tasks both simple and complex.</p><p>Our pen tool, for example, has been rethought to feel and function more similarly to a physical pen. Vector objects in Figma are drawn as networks of points, rather than traditional paths, meaning you can connect any point to any other point. This change allows for a more flexible and natural drawing process, shifting the focus from procedure to production.</p><figure></figure><p>The Figma editor should feel like a tightly knolled workbench. The basic tools you need to get started are simple and well organized. Having the right tools in the proper places is a prerequisite to building.</p><h2 id="control"><a href="#control">Control</a></h2><p>Tactile familiarity goes a long way towards feeling in control when working with hand tools and digital tools alike. Keyboard shortcuts are a familiar opportunity to give users this physical control and increase efficiency. The product detail I’m most proud of is a key command that addresses an annoyance in selecting nested items on screen.</p><p>A common desire is to select the content of an element without selecting the element itself, like selecting the buttons within a toolbar without selecting the toolbar.</p><figure></figure><p>When you command+drag, Figma uses a heuristic to figure out which items are the container and which are contained, and it will select only the contained items. This allows you to box select all the icons in the toolbar without selecting the toolbar background itself. I have found this command to be incredibly useful and a significant time saver as it lets me work with the elements in the scene without having to think about layer hierarchy.</p><h2 id="color"><a href="#color">Color</a></h2><p>The principle that furniture should facilitate living was informative to the original visual design of Figma. Just as furniture should fade away when in use, it was our intention early on to create a system to ensure that the visual style of our product wouldn’t distract users from the aesthetics of their own designs.</p><p>A previous version of Figma embraced an “unskinned” visual style, relying almost entirely on a monochromatic palette. It was effective for a time, but as we added functionality, it became increasingly difficult to clearly differentiate between UI components.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c4e56694d3d7a414d52dc3f8e137250a6f343c7a-1800x570.png?w=670&amp;h=212&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c4e56694d3d7a414d52dc3f8e137250a6f343c7a-1800x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c4e56694d3d7a414d52dc3f8e137250a6f343c7a-1800x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c4e56694d3d7a414d52dc3f8e137250a6f343c7a-1800x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c4e56694d3d7a414d52dc3f8e137250a6f343c7a-1800x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/c4e56694d3d7a414d52dc3f8e137250a6f343c7a-1800x570.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Figma UI, before and after.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, we reconsidered our strategy. It wasn’t that the UI had to totally “disappear,” but instead should go unnoticed. To do this, our current visual style uses color as an additional layer of semantics. For instance, green is used for actions and blue for selection. These groupings across the layout of the tool help inform users at a glance, shifting cognition from how to what they’re drawing.</p><h2 id="design-across-disciplines"><a href="#design-across-disciplines">Design Across Disciplines</a></h2><p>To create innovative solutions for design tools, we must continually challenge our collective frame of reference. In his post Grid Systems for Screen Design, my teammate Johan Prag pointed out that “some of the most interesting solutions may come from looking to the past.” I agree and move to cast this net even wider. The best principles of design transcend disciplines. Let’s look not only to the past but also outside of our immediate field to move design tools forward.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Grid Systems for Screen Design</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/grid-systems-for-screen-design/</link>
      <description>In the 1950s, a small group of Swiss designers started searching for a better way of systematizing how information was organized on the printed page.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the 1950s, a small group of Swiss designers started searching for a better way of systematizing how information was organized on the printed page. Their work came to be known as grid design and a handful of pioneers like Joseph Müller-Brockmann and Karl Gerstner produced work that was as beautiful as it was rational.</p><p>Today their ideas are still foundational. Grids are the invisible scaffolding that give a design coherence. Their work took for granted a few things, though: a fixed page size with precise control over type-size, line-height and margins. Because of this, it can often feel incompatible within our current age of designing for a fluidity of device sizes and screen densities. We at Figma believe this is less a problem of philosophical incompatibility, and more an issue of contemporary digital designers lacking the proper tools. We think grids are as foundational for our flexible canvases as they are for a fixed page.</p><p>As we started designing for screens, much traditional knowledge was thrown out due to the technical limitations of the new medium. Nowadays, we have better support for typography and better control over layouts, but the tools we are using have not yet adapted to designing for screens. Even for web design where browser sizes are fluid, designers are still working with tools created for fixed layouts. A designer or an engineer then has to figure out how to translate a design based on the conventions of the past into the present reality of knowing very little about how the design will be displayed. Making sure that the design translates would either involve a lot of repetitive copy/pasting between artboards of different sizes or some sophisticated guesswork.</p><p>When the first iPad was introduced, many designers welcomed the return of the page and of edges — comforting boundaries that help anchor a design. With new devices introduced every year, it is now obvious that the ‘page’ in digital design can take any size and shape. Less obvious is how a tool can allow you to design in a way that is flexible yet also allows for a fine degree of control.</p><h2 id="building-blocks"><a href="#building-blocks">Building blocks</a></h2><p>When I started working at Figma, I thought this was a challenge our team could tackle. Our approach is to create a set of tools built for flexible screen sizes that allow you to create very powerful layout systems when properly combined. The toolset consists of a) constraints b) layout grids and c) the ability to nest a frame inside of another frame. (We call them frames, other people call them artboards.) You can get started using just one of these tools, but the real power comes from combining them.</p><figure><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?rect=0,0,1440,404&amp;w=670&amp;h=188&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format" srcset="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.5 335w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=0.75 503w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1 670w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=1.5 1005w,https://cdn.sanity.io/images/599r6htc/production/75c41d380c886288c21260c997767cc875f4fb6d-1440x405.png?w=670&amp;q=75&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;dpr=2 1340w" loading="lazy" alt=""/></p><figcaption>Constraints, grids &amp; frames in Figma</figcaption></figure><h2 id="constraints"><a href="#constraints">Constraints</a></h2><p>We started with constraints. Constraints allow you to specify how an object should respond as its frame changes size. You can tell an object to stay to the left, the right, or to stretch to fill up space.</p><figure><figcaption>Left, right, center &amp; stretch</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-grid"><a href="#the-grid">The grid</a></h2><p>Constraints give you a very basic framework for creating designs where elements stick to the edges of a frame or are centered in it, but we know most designs are a bit more complex than that. This is where grids come in. In Figma, grids are the device that allows granular control over how constraints work.</p><p>Take a look at this design. We use a grid system to keep everything in balance, but how would you want the design to change as the screen resizes? What if you want X to grow with the change in screen dimensions? Our solution has been to allow grids to stretch, and our constraint system knows how to work hand-in-hand with the grid. If you stretch a box over two grid columns, the box will grow and shrink to align itself to the grid as the screen size changes.</p><p>Beyond the obvious use of a column grid to dictate the flow of text on a web-page, column grids are useful for helping align all kinds of elements. For example, consider a row of icons in a toolbar with each icon aligned to a column of the grid. At that point, the grid and constraints alone do not allow the icons to respond to the grid whilst also allowing for a different layout of the main content. However, it does when you nest one frame inside of another.</p><figure><figcaption>A design based on a 2-column grid with 4 vertical modules</figcaption></figure><h2 id="frames-within-frames"><a href="#frames-within-frames">Frames within frames</a></h2><p>Nesting frames is the last piece of the puzzle that gives you full control over the alignment of your design as a whole. This ability is also one of the reasons why we chose not to call them artboards, frames go beyond artboards in the functionality they offer. Using multiple frames for the same design also allows you to set up different layout grids for different parts of your design.</p><p>If you’re familiar with HTML, you might notice this structure is similar to how you would translate a design into code. The idea of a nested frame has a lot in common with a nested <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>.</p><figure><figcaption>Nested frames allow for complex design systems</figcaption></figure><p>Moving beyond static layouts is just a start. Where else is there room for improvement? This is an opportune time to question how our design tools work, think critically about how well they really meet our needs, and to try new solutions. Some of the most interesting solutions may come from looking to the past for ideas.</p><h2 id="acknowledgements"><a href="#acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</a></h2><p>The thoughts presented here are the result of countless conversations at Figma about design tools, grids, and the history of design. Evan Wallace deserves special mention for originating key concepts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Slack From the Start</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A few weeks ago, we launched Figma, a collaborative interface design tool. Our integration with Slack is foundational to how users collaborate inside Figma.</p><p>Let me explain. As we built Figma over the past few years, we talked with countless designers about how they collaborate with the rest of their team. In these conversations, we dove into everything from storing files to creating specifications to making product decisions.</p><p>We learned a lot about how our customers like to work, and one of the biggest surprises was how popular Slack was with our target market. Seemingly overnight, over half of the designers we were talking with started to report using Slack all day, every day. We also realized that Slack usage was highly correlated with other behaviors; for example, many designers who used Slack were more open and transparent about their design process.</p><p>Figma is a tool that helps teams communicate about design, so it was tempting for us to recreate a lot of the features that are already in Slack. But we also knew, from our own usage of Slack, that we didn’t want to create yet another place to check messages. Rather than duplicate features and make designers set up teams twice, we decided to build the core of Figma’s collaboration experience on top of Slack. A Figma team is a Slack team. Notifications about files in Figma come through Slack, not Figma itself.</p><p>Tonight we’re celebrating the launch of the Slack platform. Given that we’ve thought of Slack as a platform for the past year, this wasn’t a huge surprise to us. Tightly integrating Figma with Slack was a big bet, but it seems to be paying off. We’re excited to watch many other companies follow a similar path!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Building a professional design tool on the web</title>
      <link>https://www.figma.com/blog/building-a-professional-design-tool-on-the-web/</link>
      <description>Our vision for the future of design tools is one where both the tool and the content are easily available to anyone, anywhere.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Our vision for the future of design tools is one where both the tool and the content are easily available to anyone, anywhere. That’s why we built <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>, a collaborative interface design tool that we <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/design-meet-the-internet/">recently launched</a>, as a browser-based cloud service. When we set out to build Figma we knew it would be a challenge. To really succeed it would have to provide a high-fidelity editing experience that professionals would accept and would have to work consistently everywhere.</p><div><blockquote><p>Pulling this off was really hard; we’ve basically ended up building a browser inside a browser.</p></blockquote></div><p>The reason this is hard is because the web wasn’t designed as a general-purpose computing platform. It started off as a technology primarily for documents and had a whole bunch of stuff for application development bolted on top. That stuff usually took the form of specific APIs for one-off cases instead of providing general primitives that can be used to implement all sorts of things. Some examples:</p><ul><li>CSS has lots of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#font-rend-props">fancy text layout algorithms</a> but no way to customize the algorithms or to read back the result of what the browser did so the text layout algorithm can be used as part of another algorithm.</li><li>All browsers provide a <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/gpu-accelerated-compositing-in-chrome">high-performance</a> <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj680148%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">GPU compositor</a> but the web doesn’t have any way of hooking into the rendering algorithm and changing how compositing works to add things like performance optimizations or custom blend modes.</li><li>Browsers embed <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=573948">highly-optimized</a> <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=48789">image</a> <a href="https://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2013/09/12/using-hardware-to-decode-and-load-jpg-images-up-to-45-faster-in-internet-explorer-11.aspx">decoders</a> that decode images asynchronously off the UI thread using the latest hardware features, but there’s no API for passing parameters to the decoders to do things like <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2014Apr/0064.html">handle EXIF orientation</a> or avoid <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=425935#c8">baking in the display color space</a> when using drawImage and getImageData.</li></ul><p>This lack of general primitives on the web is <a href="https://extensiblewebmanifesto.org/">starting to change</a> and now there are technologies like WebGL and asm.js that let developers cut past the browser and talk directly to the hardware. It’s this advancement that’s finally made high-performance web-based graphics applications practical. Developers no longer need to wait for the exact features they need to be added to the web, they can build those features themselves!</p><h2 id="emscripten"><a href="#emscripten">Emscripten</a></h2><p>Our editor is written in C++ and cross-compiled to JavaScript using the <a href="https://emscripten.org/">emscripten</a> cross-compiler. The emscripten compiler targets the asm.js JavaScript subset which provides a way to get JavaScript JITs to emit predictable, compact machine code and is <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/03/asm-speedups-everywhere/">widely supported</a> in all modern browsers. This has the following benefits:</p><ul><li>We fully control memory layout and can use compact 32-bit floats or even bytes when appropriate instead of JavaScript’s 64-bit doubles. This is very important for apps like ours that use large amounts of data.</li><li>The generated code is completely in control of allocation, which makes it much easier to hit 60fps by avoiding GC pauses. All C++ objects are just reserved ranges in a pre-allocated typed array so the JavaScript GC is never involved.</li><li>The generated code is pre-optimized using LLVM’s advanced optimizer. This combined with C++ template specialization generates very efficient code that is able to come within a factor of <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/05/asm-js-performance-improvements-in-the-latest-version-of-firefox-make-games-fly/">2x native performance or better</a>.</li><li>All asm.js code is guaranteed to be free of deoptimization points so JITs can do ahead-of-time compilation and provide predictable performance. Regular JavaScript code relies on JIT heuristics instead and performance can sometimes vary wildly between subsequent runs of the same code.</li></ul><p>That’s not to say emscripten is perfect. As with any new technology, there were bumps along the road. One big issue for us was that certain browser configurations couldn’t allocate large ranges of continuous address space for the huge typed array that contains the entire emscripten memory space. The worst case was <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=394591">32-bit Chrome on Windows</a> which sometimes couldn’t even allocate a 256mb typed array because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization">ASLR</a> was fragmenting the address space. This has since been fixed.</p><p>A trick that also helps is to use handles to out-of-heap data for large resources such as image and geometry buffers. We have an internal API called IndirectBuffer (which we are open sourcing <a href="https://github.com/evanw/indirectbuffer">here</a>) that references an external typed array and makes it available to C++. Moving large allocations out of the main heap reduces memory fragmentation issues for long-running sessions, allows us to use more of the limited address space in 32-bit browsers, and allows us to break past the <a href="https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/f01d2bb66fcde2c3519c4f0c61f790387fd5faee/Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/ArrayBuffer.h#L255">31-bit typed array size limitation</a> in 64-bit browsers.</p><p>Current asm.js support is already quite good but there’s more exciting changes coming up. <a href="https://www.2ality.com/2015/06/web-assembly.html">WebAssembly</a> is an effort to implement a binary format for asm.js code to drastically reduce parse time that all major browser vendors are on board with. Right now the only form of multithreading is using web workers with message passing, but the upcoming <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#Specifications">shared typed array</a> specification will make shared-memory multithreading a reality.</p><h2 id="rendering"><a href="#rendering">Rendering</a></h2><p>We’ve implemented our own rendering engine to make sure content renders quickly and consistently across platforms. Browsers have amazing graphics implementations and we initially attempted to use them instead of building a new rendering engine. Without a low-level API to access the browser’s render tree, the available options are either HTML, SVG, or 2D canvas. None of these options were satisfactory for many reasons:</p><ul><li>HTML and SVG contain a lot of baggage and are often much slower than the 2D canvas API due to DOM access. These are usually optimized for scrolling, not zooming, and geometry is often re-tessellated after every scale change.</li><li>There is no guarantee about GPU acceleration and many things are still rendered on the CPU, which can be quite slow in certain cases.</li><li>Support for masking, blurring, and blend modes in HTML and SVG varies wildly between browsers and is often not anti-aliased or is too low resolution on high-DPI displays.</li><li>The 2D canvas API is an immediate mode API instead of a retained mode API so all geometry has to be re-uploaded to the graphics card every frame. This is needlessly wasteful and can become a bottleneck.</li><li>Text layout is <a href="https://css-tricks.com/font-rendering-differences-firefox-vs-ie-vs-safari/">inconsistent between browsers</a> and is even inconsistent between the <a href="https://blog.typekit.com/2010/10/21/type-rendering-web-browsers/">same browser on different platforms</a>.</li><li>We wanted to be able to add features such as <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ivV6l.png">angular gradients</a> which are not supported by any of these rendering APIs.</li></ul><p>Instead of attempting to get one of these to work, we implemented everything from scratch using WebGL. Our renderer is a highly-optimized tile-based engine with support for masking, blurring, dithered gradients, blend modes, nested layer opacity, and more. All rendering is done on the GPU and is fully anti-aliased. Internally our code looks a lot like a browser inside a browser; we have our own DOM, our own compositor, our own text layout engine, and we’re thinking about adding a render tree just like the one browsers use to render HTML.</p><h2 id="browsers"><a href="#browsers">Browsers</a></h2><p>The functionality of the web platform is still catching up to native platforms and there are unfortunately still a few gaps here and there. While we don’t have the resources to fill some of the larger gaps, I still try to fix what I can when it makes sense.</p><p>Before I started working on Figma, high-DPI custom cursors were really broken on the web. I had to manually fix <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=268537">Chrome</a>, <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=888689">Firefox</a>, and <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=120783">WebKit</a> because all of them were broken in different ways. There still isn’t a single unified way to do it (SVG for Firefox, -webkit-image-set for Chrome and WebKit, and the ancient .cur format for IE) but at least it’s possible now.</p><p>I’ve also fixed a few <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=97237">egregious</a> <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/angleproject/issues/detail?id=415">performance</a> and <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=239731">usability</a> bugs to make our product better. The web can be frustrating sometimes, but browsers aren’t a black box (well, except for <em>that</em> browser) and often all it takes to fix annoying issues with the web is an afternoon of poking around in browser code, a day of back-and-forth over a patch, and a few months of waiting for the release to roll out.</p><p>There’s still more that the web platform could do that would make Figma even better:</p><ul><li>Our biggest pain point is lack of access to glyph outlines and kerning tables which there currently <a href="https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=21939">isn’t any way</a> <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2dcontext2/#textmetrics">of getting at</a>. One of the primary concerns is fingerprinting, but that battle has <a href="https://discourse.wicg.io/t/api-to-get-list-of-available-fonts/1197">already been lost</a>. We’re hoping access to font data can be exposed behind a user permission prompt like other privacy-sensitive APIs. Chrome has come up with a <a href="https://github.com/DHNishi/LocalFontAccess/blob/master/explainer.md">proposal</a> for a fix that’s currently <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=535764">in the works</a> (they’ve been really helpful!) but there’s nothing else on the horizon for other browsers.</li><li>We would love to add support for common clipboard formats (.ai, .pdf, etc.) but the web <a href="https://github.com/w3c/clipboard-apis/issues/9#issuecomment-159023296">has no way to do this</a>. The only formats in the spec are text/plain and text/html (our Figma clipboard “format” is text/html with binary data encoded in an HTML comment).</li><li>Another issue for us is lack of support for the OS X trackpad pinch gesture. Chrome added a <a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=289887">little-known hack</a> where the pinch gesture sends the wheel event with ctrlKey down and calling preventDefault() allows the page to handle it. This is amazing and makes zooming and panning in Figma feel native and effortless. I tried to <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1052253">add it to Firefox</a> but that attempt is currently stuck. Pinching in Safari causes zooming behavior that’s really confusing to users and is <a href="https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145214">impossible to disable</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2><p>Performance and quality are some of our most important features. They’re a little different than normal features because you only notice them when they aren’t there, but they make all the difference.</p><p>I’m very excited to finally reveal Figma to the world. The product isn’t open to the public yet but you can <a href="https://www.figma.com/">sign up</a> for our waiting list and try it out soon. Let us know what you think!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, after three years of silence and hard work, I finally get to announce the launch of Figma, a collaborative interface design tool. We’re also announcing the funding we’ve raised to date ($18MM) from Greylock, Index, OATV and some amazing angels including Jeff Weiner, DJ Patil, Adam Nash and Soleio Cuervo.</p><p>Ever since Writely (now called Google Docs) launched ten years ago, I’ve believed that all software should be online, real-time and collaborative. Creative tools haven’t made the leap because the browser has not been powerful enough. Now, with WebGL, everything has changed.</p><p>I first glimpsed the power of WebGL in April 2011. My classmate, Evan Wallace, had just returned to the Brown CS lab after a weekend hackathon. He pulled me aside and showed me how he had re-implemented a server side image processing API in WebGL. “You know,” said Evan, “we could use this thing to build creative tools in the browser.”</p><p>This made my ears perk up. Over the next year, Evan and I talked constantly about how we could make creative tools accessible using WebGL and, with the support of the Thiel Fellowship, we decided to start a company together.</p><p>We quickly realized the biggest pain point designers face on a day-to-day basis is collaboration with their teams. These problems are further exacerbated because the role of the designer is more cross-functional than ever before. Designers are at the center of the organization: on any given day they might find themselves sharing assets with another designer, adjusting copy for marketing or making redlines for an engineer. While engineers have built all sorts of tools which make it easy for them to work as a team, designers are still in the dark ages when it comes to collaborative workflows. From designing to commenting to sharing to storing, no single tool tackles the entire workflow in one place.</p><h2 id="introducing-figma"><a href="#introducing-figma">Introducing Figma</a></h2><p>When we started working on Figma, we knew it was possible to build a fast and stable graphics tool in the browser, but we had no idea how hard it would be. From vector rendering to font layout to a million performance edge cases, getting here hasn’t been easy. Designers have high expectations for a tool they rely on every day! After dogfooding Figma internally for the past eighteen months and working closely with alpha customers, I’m confident we’ve reached this high bar.</p><p>While the technical achievement of building a vector based UI design tool in the browser is exciting, I’m even more excited by the collaborative possibilities we’re starting to unlock. Whether you’re sharing a design with a link, giving contextual feedback or setting shared brand colors for your team to use, Figma makes it easy to work with your team.</p><h2 id="what-s-next"><a href="#what-s-next">What’s Next</a></h2><p>Today, we’re announcing our Preview Release: a way for teams to get early access to Figma and help shape our product roadmap. We’re just getting started, so right now the only cost is your feedback.</p><p>Here are some specific things we’re really excited about in 2016:</p><p>Making our existing Slack integration even better<br/>Creating a shared asset library for your team<br/>Simultaneous, multiplayer editing (!!!)<br/>The possibilities of what you can do with Figma are limitless. I can’t wait to see what you will create.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
