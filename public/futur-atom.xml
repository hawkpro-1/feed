    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competition in the field of design is fierce. We all do what we can to stay in the game. We &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/learn-typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;learn&lt;/a&gt; new skills (shout-out to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Typography 01!&lt;/a&gt;), grab all the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/resources/typography-manual&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;free resources&lt;/a&gt; we can, and try to stay ahead of the curve and on the cutting edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until we can get our hands on a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; crystal ball or Doc’s Delorean, the only way to look into the future of typographic design is to look back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bit of a contradiction, we know, but so is “learn the rules so you can break them,” and that adage has yet to steer us wrong!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s go back together and meet the foundation-layers, rule-makers-and-breakers, and early innovators of typography design. Then we’ll give you a heads up on who’s been shaking things up in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/content/typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;typography&lt;/a&gt; world more recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leading Legends of Typography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIET ZWART&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4cd593b6be2d12e3c879_legends-of-type-PIET-ZWART.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Hugo van Gelderen.

Yeah, graphic design has been around for a &lt;em&gt;while.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zwart is the perfect example of breaking the rules beautifully. His design played with traditional elements in new and interesting ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JAN TSCHICHOLD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4d1139591529f057b830_legends-of-type-JAN-TSCHICHOLD.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Erling Mandelmann. Licensed under Creative Commons.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tschichold was more of a rule-maker than a rule-breaker. He pushed for standardized paper sizes in publishing and created guidelines for establishing typographical hierarchy. We still use some of those guidelines today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He’s also just super cool because he literally wrote the book on intentional typography design, “Die Neue Typographie,” &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; he designed the iconic orange covers for Penguin classics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MAX MIEDINGER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4d55d37c369bcd8a70de_legends-of-type-MAX-MIEDINGER.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Born in 1910 in Zürich, Switzerland, Max Miedinger is the designer of one of the most used fonts in the world. He started his career in typography quite young, taking on an apprenticeship as a ‘typographic composer’ at the age of 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward to 1957, he designs a new typeface and calls it “Neue Haas Grotesk.” If you haven’t heard of this “most used” family of fonts before, that’s probably because it was renamed “Helvetica” in 1960.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So yeah, you could say he was a pretty big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J. MÜLLER-BROCKMANN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4dadc875b73e8a1f3158_legends-of-type-J.-MuLLER-BROCKMANN.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kleiner.

Müller-Brockmann was a “pretty big deal,” Swiss designer, too. In part because of his stunning work, but also because he gave us the gift of grids. You know &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/grids-and-layout&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;we love our grids&lt;/a&gt; here, so we’re big fans of him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so there’s more to him than just grids– he’s often referred to as the father of functional and objective design and a “pioneer” of the International Typographic Style. But for real, the grids are seriously a game-changer.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HERB LUBALIN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4de305a1ce30d93db62e_legends-of-type-HERB-LUBALIN.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Herb Lubalin lives at the intersection of fun and functional. His designs, which he referred to as “typographics” are playful, but simple and effective. He brings type and image together like a perfect puzzle, using letterforms as part of an icon or an image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His use of visual puns is difficult to describe, but impossible to miss when you see it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;CARLO L. VIVARELLI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4e387d3e5a12e98789ab_legends-of-type-CARLO-VIVARELLI.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Another influential Swiss designer for the list, Carlo L. Vivarelli was a founding member of the Swiss design publication “Neue Grafik.” His design stands out because it is clean, clear, symmetrical, and bold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ADRIAN FRUTIGER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4e5377a9232d88d0502d_legends-of-type-adrian-frutiger.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Henk Gianotten&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adrian Frutiger was all about that balance between function and fashion. He believed that a good designer should be able to create truly beautiful typefaces without having to sacrifice readability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He rose to his own challenge and created over 30 new typefaces that are both beautiful and readable. You’d probably recognize some of them, as they’ve been used on road signs all over the world. Point happily taken, Frutiger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MASSIMO VIGNELLI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4e7171b68053a186fdd3_legends-of-type-MASSIMO-VIGNELLI.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Lella and Massimo Vignelli. Photo by Arwcheek.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we’re on the topics of navigation and fashionable function, we absolutely cannot skip over &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/massimo-vignelli-best-quotes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Massimo Vignelli.&lt;/a&gt; He’s one of our faves and for good reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took the massive meandering messy map of the New York City subway and not only turned it into something beautiful to look at, but he made it &lt;em&gt;useable!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also had a way with words in general, not just in their design. He referred to himself as an “information architect,” which is probably the coolest title ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ED FELLA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4e898f251ca39378f077_legends-of-type-ED-FELLA.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Ed Fella really knew how to play with type. His style is referred to as “American Folk Art Typography” and when you see the super fun font he designed, you’ll get it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He designed “Outwest” and, somehow, he &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/hand-lettering-kit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;designed the whole thing by hand.&lt;/a&gt; Pretty incredible!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WOLFGANG WEINGART&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4eb27e082d8674b76411_legends-of-type-WOLFGANG-WEINGART.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by S Knapp, Basel.

He was working with image layering in a way that no one else was at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was responsible for the development of “New Wave” typography, also known as “Swiss Punk” typography. Swiss punk! Seriously, what’s not to like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;PAULA SCHER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4ecb66129fec29494de7_legends-of-type-PAULA-SCHER.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by OnCreativity.

In some of her posters, it’s almost like the type is being used as crosshatching to fill the space.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ZUZANA LICKO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4ee6ff86c9e42c35069c_legends-of-type-ZUZANA-LICKO.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a left-handed person forced to write with her right hand, Licko wasn’t all that into typography. Until 1984, when the first Apple Macintosh personal computer came out and changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She created over three dozen font families, innovating and experimenting with the new technology as she went. When she settled into her style, she favored design that was simple and timeless.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GAIL ANDERSON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4ef993b6be9f03e48d91_legends-of-type-GAIL-ANDERSON.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Louise Fili and Gail Anderson.

Fortunately for us, she also loves writing and teaching about type and has written some excellent books on the topic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She’s also the first African-American woman to receive the National Design Award for Lifetime Achievement.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Today’s Designers You Should Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VERONIKA BURIAN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4f5d973e8a5ca409dc1f_legends-of-type-VERONIKA-BURIAN.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;As an award-winning type designer and cofounder of the font foundry “TypeTogether,” &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the women-centered “alphabettes.com,” &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/vikosch_b/?hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Veronika Burian&lt;/a&gt; is pretty much a legend in the making. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite apparently having completely “illegible” handwriting, Burian has created some pretty fantastic, bold, and beautiful calligraphic typeface, Maiola. We’re keepin’ both eyes on this designer and you totally should, too. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ALICE SAVOIE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4f6c4f63162107c5fc8c_legends-of-type-ALICE-SAVOIE.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Louis Lepais.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another designer putting emphasis on individuality, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/alice_savoie/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Alive Savoie&lt;/a&gt; designs custom font families and we’re really into her use of color and weight contrast. This is some cool stuff and we’re excited to see where she goes with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SEBASTIAN STAPELFELDT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4fad6b7234fa85f4dde9_legends-of-type-SEBASTIAN-STAPELFELDT.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Also known as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/carlhauser/?hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;“Carl Hauser,”&lt;/a&gt; Sebastian is blending nostalgia with innovation in ways we haven’t seen before and we love to see it now!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He designed a clock that uses twelve different typefaces, which is just about the niftiest thing we’ve ever seen. What will he do next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;HRVOJE GRUBISIC&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4fbf082365f79d6bbfac_legends-of-type-HRVOJE-GRUBISIC.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The founder of Holographik Studio, which launched in 2021, Hrvoje Grubisic uses simple shapes in complex ways. His design also heavily features repetition, used in all manner of ways. We think he’s pretty &lt;em&gt;cool cool cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;ANNIE ATKINS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-image&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62bc4fd97bb3b4cb1abd05cc_legends-of-type-ANNIE-ATKINS.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.annieatkins.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Annie Atkins’&lt;/a&gt; sweet nostalgic typographic designs are used as labels, maps, letters, or really any background material in films.

    <title>5 Notion Frameworks For Freelancers &amp; Agency Owners</title>

Have we missed one or many things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way or another, if you’re reading this, we’re guessing that you frequently find yourself stressed, overwhelmed, unable to efficiently track projects or hold yourself or your team accountable, and generally feeling like you have so much to do that you don’t know what to work on or when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It doesn’t have to stay this way!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, at The Futur, &lt;strong&gt;we use a single tool for nearly everything.&lt;/strong&gt; This one tool helps us…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Manage our creative projects, clients, and teams&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Track and improve our sales&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Streamline our content planning process and creation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Store documents, contracts, and files&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make spreadsheets practically obsolete&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s called Notion and we love it so much, in fact, that &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/operating-system&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;we’ve created The Operating System (OpSys)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, an all-in-one template to manage projects, clients, and sales for your agency, studio, or freelance business&lt;/strong&gt;—powered by Notion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While building OpSys, we were inspired by the following frameworks and wanted to share some insights about what we’ve learned along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Pillars, Pipelines, and Values&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure class=&#34;w-richtext-align-fullwidth w-richtext-figure-type-video&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34;

about Pillars, Pipelines, and Values:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;It has a lot of resources and examples to learn the framework&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It works for most situations or needs within your business&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It has a variety of dashboards, and examples for when they’d come in handy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is flexible in how you use the framework (business and personal)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you need structure, this gives you that—providing clarity on what you need to be working on&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;strong&gt;what we don’t like&lt;/strong&gt; about Pillars, Pipelines, and Values:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;It needs to be customized for business use (vs. personal use)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It requires learning new lingo that may create barriers to use&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It requires a lot of data that needs to be put into Notion&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It uses a ton of individual elements (&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/d93SGaf82OM?t=417&#34;

about Bulletproof:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;It requires sifting through heaps of documentation to explain how to use it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The core principles are solid (i.e. centralize information, present, and filter using dashboards)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can purchase a pre-made template, making it easier to get started&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;strong&gt;what don’t we like&lt;/strong&gt; about Bulletproof:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;It introduces a lot of new lingo/vocabulary that you need to learn in order to use it&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You can purchase a pre-made template (the template can be difficult to set up—not knowing what information is just an example;

about RAPID:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The framework is focused more on decision-making than project/agency management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There’s not much documentation to go off of&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this is to say, dear friend, that there’s no one size fits all when it comes to how you “should” use Notion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/operating-system&#34;

    <title>Top 20 Typography FAQs Answered</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there’s one topic that all designers should be curious about right now, it’s typography design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you may have heard that curiosity killed the cat, but did you know that satisfaction brought them back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, now you know! &lt;em&gt;wink&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So come on, all you cool, creative cats! It’s time to satisfy your typography curiosity with the answers to the most frequently asked questions we get.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is typography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a literal sense, typography is the appearance and style of text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typeface, style, color, and size of the font you’re reading right now, the shapes of the paragraphs on this page, the background colors and contrasts… all of these are basic parts of typography design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figuratively though? &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/what-is-typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Typography is so much more than that.&lt;/a&gt; It is text and visual working together in harmony to enhance and elevate the message being communicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Why is typography important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;From ensuring basic readability to building brand credibility, typography goes a long way. Imagine a webpage full of pixelated, overly stylized, and faint text on a busy background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At best, it would be annoying and give the reader negative feelings about the brand. At worst, it might be disorienting or headache-inducing enough to make them give up on reading the content, click away, and find another “better” brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/why-is-typography-important&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Having legible text isn’t enough, though&lt;/a&gt;. Good typography is also vital to capture attention, establish a brand voice, and ultimately influence a reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How does typography influence people?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many small changes that we make in design, which result in big differences in mood and message. You might favor “cooler” colors to evoke a “refreshing” or “calm” vibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/how-typography-can-influence-a-reader&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;It’s the same with typography&lt;/a&gt;. The colors, shapes, contrasts, weights, spacing, and pretty much everything about text can shift the way we interact with it and interpret it. Let’s consider the 2021 rebrand of Burger King:&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8cb45b3ec8e659612e271_20-typography-faqs-burger-king.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;JKR Global, the creative agency behind the rebrand, had a lot to say about BK’s first rebrand in over 20 years:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We set out to make the brand feel less synthetic and artificial, more real, crave-able and tasty.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also mentioned that the new font, &lt;em&gt;Flame Sans&lt;/em&gt; “...evokes the natural, organic shapes of food.” All of that sounds like &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; to expect from typography, but it’s completely reasonable to expect that influence, aaaand now we’re hungry!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What letter anatomy terms do I need to know?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re on the hunt for a unique font style that is tailored to your client’s needs and/or you have to &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/SPmqQb7AaME&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;design a whole new typeface from scratch,&lt;/a&gt; you’re gonna need to know the lingo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From ascenders to gadzooks(!), we’ve got you covered.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WzVl_ATHUQ0&#34; title=&#34;Typographic Terminology A to Z: Our list of typography terms that every designer should know.&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8cbc813d0fa85129ac5c9_20-typography-faqs-letter-anatomy.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the difference between a letter, a character, and a glyph?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ooh, great question! It can feel a little bit like a logic puzzle trying to work this out, but once you get it, you’ll &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; get it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Character&lt;/em&gt; - a broad term that covers letters, numbers, punctuation, accent marks, and other symbols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Letter -&lt;/em&gt; covered under “character,” a letter is… a letter! Not a number, punctuation, or any other symbol; the letter is strictly A-Z.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glyph&lt;/em&gt; - the visual representation of a character – each shape and design is a different glyph, even if it’s the same character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are several different &lt;em&gt;glyphs&lt;/em&gt; representing the same &lt;em&gt;character.&lt;/em&gt; In this example, the character happens to be a &lt;em&gt;letter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8cbee14fd4892a7cc62ea_20-typography-faqs-glyph-examples.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where can you find alternate glyphs that some fonts have?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re looking at new fonts, font foundries and resellers do tend to list that there are alternate glyphs available with the download and may even display them alongside the other examples or include an additional .pdf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How do you access and use alternate glyphs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should be able to do this easily with most professional software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Open up the glyphs panel within the software that you’re using and review the glyphs available by type, either for every font, or a specific selection that you’ve made.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8cc288a1c9811d9af1911_20-typography-faqs-glyph-panel.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Adobe Illustrator’s Glyph Panel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can apply these changes individually by inserting the glyph where you need it, or you can select however much of your text you want and apply the changes globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the difference between a typeface and a font?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These terms are often used interchangeably, but font and typeface are actually different. If you’re going to be talkin’ type as a designer, you’re going to need to understand the difference and use these terms correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s really not all that complex– time for a little show-and-tell! Here’s your visual guide:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8cc8e74ce864a7181c62a_20%20typography%20faqs.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And here’s what we have to say about it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typeface is a style of lettering.A font is a variation of a typeface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bada bing (and we cannot stress this enough) BADA BOOM! You’re practically an expert!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are the most common ‘types’ of typefaces?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short answer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8ccf202c17c79f53b9dee_20-typography-faqs-typeface-types.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want the longer answer and have absolutely no idea what a serif is or what we’re talking about here, make sure you check out our short guide to essential &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/WzVl_ATHUQ0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;typography terminology.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where did we get serifs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we’re on the same page with what a serif is, please proceed! If not, please go back to the typography terminology guide linked above– do not pass go, do not collect $200 until you check it out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So where do those funky little letter lines come from? Originally, physically, serifs were just a “happy little accident” in a way. They were running starts and resting stops for calligraphers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neat! So how did we end up with them in print?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, people were… less than keen on fancy new technologies like the printing press back in the day. The goal was often to make the lettering look handwritten and not printed by a big scary machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This explains why we didn’t really have the term “serif” until we had “sans-serif.” Basically, we didn’t know what we had until it was gone. &lt;em&gt;single tear for the serifs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a script typeface?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Script typefaces bring us back to handwriting again! Some are extravagant and elegant, others are cute and playful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They should be used sparingly and never for “body” text because they can hurt legibility. They do come in handy for extra fancy occasions like weddings or extra informal occasions like a bake sale:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8cd369479d506c0649b4e_20-typography-faqs-dearly-beloved.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8cd44398690363e119804_20-typography-faqs-cupcakes.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What are some basic rules for typography layout?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want the basics?

Using far too many fonts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You really don’t need more than one font, especially when you’re starting out. Maybe we could agree to two different fonts, but don’t push the maybe, baby.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8cec265e996e25f47de92_20-typography-faqs-too-many-fonts.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Giving too many signals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you sensing a theme here? We want a good, clean type. Too many signals throw off the hierarchy and draw a reader out of the experience and make them pay too much attention to HOW they’re reading instead of WHAT they’re reading.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8cf06d8084cf34ed6e67a_20-typography-faqs-signals.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;3. Bad spacing- between letters, between lines, and even between paragraphs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a crime because it affects the legibility &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; readability of your text. If we can’t pick out individual letters or know which letters belong to which words, we get frustrated and stop reading. If paragraphs are stacked too closely, we get bored and stop reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, if paragraphs are too far apart, we can’t figure out what ideas are related to each other, we misunderstand, and yep, we probably… stop reading.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8cf3514fd4845adcd41fd_20-typography-faqs-bad-spacing.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What font size is “best”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “best” font size is going to depend on the purpose, the medium, and the audience, but in general, body text in print is between 9-12px and for screens, it should be between 16-12px.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn more about how and why size matters here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/typography-for-beginners&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Typography for Beginners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;How many characters should you use per line?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is another question that has no single perfect answer. The human brain tends to be most comfortable with lines made up of about 40 to 60 characters. Any shorter and the eye jumps around too quickly. Any longer and our attention fades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What is the difference between leading and kerning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re almost like cousins! Leading refers to the spacing between individual lines of text. If you’ve ever had to “double-space” an essay, congratulations- you have adjusted leading!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kerning, on the other hand, refers to the spacing between individual letters. Kerning can be adjusted to move specific letters further away from each other without affecting the others. If you need more context or are a visual learner, definitely check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://type.method.ac/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this cool kerning game!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is tracking?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like leading and kerning, tracking has to do with spacing. Unlike leading and kerning, though, tracking manipulates the spacing between &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the letters in your text equally. It’s more like scrunching up or stretching out the letters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very important side note: “Stretching” your text is both a design &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; type crime! Please don’t “stretch” when you have perfectly good “tracking” at your disposal! Well, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; can stretch (and probably should, little computer goblin), but please don’t ever stretch your text!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62b8cf904460e9d733b1f50d_20-typography-faqs-stretching.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is kinetic typography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a fancy name for “moving text.” And to be quite honest, it deserves a fancy name! It’s a pretty fancy thing, which brings design and text into the fascinating world of animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our favorite example of this &lt;em&gt;just so happens to be&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/QrNi9FmdlxY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;one of our videos!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is an accessible typeface?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;An accessible typeface is easily readable by most people and assistive technology. In general, it should be sans-serif, with letters that don’t blend into each other or get mistaken for one another (like the classic lowercase “L” vs uppercase “i” dilemma).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The typeface we use for all of the lovely text you see here is a pretty good example of that accessibility at work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, your typography should also be responsive to be completely accessible.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is responsive typography?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsive typography “responds” to the size of the device it’s being displayed on and adjusts accordingly so that the user continues to get legible and readable text no matter what device or browser they use to access the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the many, many reasons we demand, uh, &lt;em&gt;encourage&lt;/em&gt; you to test your content across all browsers and all platforms before publishing. You don’t have to do this individually– there are nifty tools online that will do it for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whew. We’ve just been through a lot together.

    <title>Crimes of Typography: The Worst Things You Can Do</title>

To save you some time, aggravation, and embarrassment, we rounded up the best (worst?) examples for ya:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;(cue the &lt;em&gt;Law and Order&lt;/em&gt; theme)&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crime #1: Using a Bad Font&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes a bad font bad? Lots of things! Some are difficult to read, others can be distracting or just plain overused.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62accc1c06d3334b6a64a03d_crimes-of-typography-bad-font.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an abundance of fonts to choose from, you can find plenty of beautiful, legible, and fresh options for your design. Here are some of our favorites:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acd1ad36141e4d16347c51_crimes-of-typography-font-list.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime #2: Using Too Many Typefaces or Font Styles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many typefaces are too many? In general, especially if you’re new to typography design, more than two typefaces or font styles are unnecessary and unadvisable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Psst! Remember that a typeface is a family of fonts.)&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62accc8dfa022ee7f867ebf1_crimes-of-typography-distracting-cluttered.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This one’s easy! Just… keep it simple! Stick to one or two choices and you should be just fine.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acccb16d19b3472d16e893_crimes-of-typography-much-better.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime #3: Poor Font Pairings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting down to two fonts is great, but it’s only half the battle!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using fonts that are too similar can lead to confusion for the reader. It takes away from the hierarchy you’re trying to establish or dampens the statement you’re trying to make.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acd471f2da3decbbd49c61_crimes-of-typography-too-similar.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing fonts together is a skill a lot like pairing wine with food. You could throw any two options together, but if you want a delicious design, it’s gotta be a perfect pair. There are so many combinations available- here are some good Google Font pairings:&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acd1f9d68dd80083562fb2_crimes-of-typography-pairing-1.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acd204d68dd80a9e5635eb_crimes-of-typography-pairing-2.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acd20f493ce5ea7f4929d8_crimes-of-typography-pairing-3.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime #4: Tragic Tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quick reminder: ‘tracking’ is the uniform spacing between all of the characters in a block of text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When letters are too close together they can overlap and become difficult to read. Too far apart and the individual words become difficult to parse out.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62accd72f2da3d23fccfc9c4_crimes-of-typography-too-close.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62accd85134e296e864fab67_crimes-of-typography-too-far.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid committing that crime of “tragic tracking,” keep the following in mind as you make your adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readability&lt;/strong&gt; - Can you read the text easily?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Relationship&lt;/strong&gt; - Can you tell what letters belong to which words?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as both of those things are true, you should be golden!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62accda2f2da3d26cbcfda3b_crimes-of-typography-just-right.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Crime #5: Stretching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distorting your text can make it harder to read, pixelated, or just plain ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, please, no stretching, scrunching/squishing, slanting, or anything else that might destroy the beautiful shapes of the letters you’re working with.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62accdcfa8d5a66d767693c0_crimes-of-typography-stretch.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re distorting to change the shape or weight of the letters, use a different style of that same font. Depending on the font you’re using and the effect you’re after,  that might be as simple as highlighting the text and clicking a button! Yep, that simple!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you just want characters to be spaced differently, remember tracking. Tracking is a great choice if you want the spaces between &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the characters in your block of text to be adjusted together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now meet tracking’s cool cousin: kerning. When everything is perfect except for just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; pesky letter that’s hanging out too closely with its neighbor, kerning has got your back.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acce02ca29773c8d021046_crimes-of-typography-kerning.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crime #6: Inappropriate Use of Hatch Marks (or Prime Marks)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatch marks (or prime marks when we’re talkin’ ‘bout measurement), also called ‘dumb quotes’ are used for noting measurements, though so many of us accidentally use them in the place of apostrophes and quotation marks. This can get confusing, but mostly it’s just… wrong. (shudders)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study up! Recognize the differences between the “dumb quotes” and “smart quotes”. Dumb quotes are usually stick-like, the markings are just plain straight lines. Smart quotes are those lovely little curved characters we use to contract and quote.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acce57134e29ed83503d87_crimes-of-typography-hatch-marks.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime #7: Rorschach Rag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Quick reminder: the ‘rag’ is the side of the paragraph that isn’t justified—i.e. in perfect alignment. In the western world the ‘rag’ is typically the right side.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re working on a concrete poem or doing some snazzy experimental or expressive typography, don’t let the rag make your paragraph into discernible and distracting shapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice that the rag is lining up perfectly square, all over the place, or lookin’ like the state of Maine, simply take control of the shapes. Manually adjust the lengths of the lines and the breaks so that the rag is a nice, organic… nothing!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acced30340332debbe0f39_crimes-of-typography-rag.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crime #8: Leaving Behind ‘Orphans’&lt;/strong&gt; a&lt;strong&gt;nd ‘Widows’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An ‘orphan’&lt;/strong&gt; is a paragraph-opening line, separated from the rest of the paragraph by a page break or column. This leaves it all by itself. So sad. So lonely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A ‘widow’&lt;/strong&gt; is similar to an orphan– it’s a paragraph-closing line, and is either uncomfortably short, leaving it “dangling” by itself at the bottom of the line &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; it’s isolated at the top of the next section or page.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62accf05338847592d2fa220_crimes-of-typography-orphan-widows.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep those lines in one big happy paragraph family! This has just about the same fix as a bad rag. You can manually adjust the lengths of the lines by adding breaks and pushing words into the next line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basically, to keep all the orphans and the widows with their paragraph families, you just have to “return” them. Get it? Return? Hah! Classic.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crime #9: SO &lt;em&gt;Many&lt;/em&gt; Signals!!!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did it hurt when you read that absolutely criminal heading? It sure hurt us to write it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why? We like it to be clear what we should be paying the most attention to, and so do most readers! When you use too many emphasizing signals, like caps, bold, italic, underline, etc. the message gets muddied and the emphasis is lost.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acce2333884748362ebaee_crimes-of-typography-hatch-marks-1.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like so many typography crimes, the fix here is to just keep it simple. Come up with one, uniform, way to emphasize your text and leave it at that. It’s seriously that easy.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crime #10: Doubling Down on Serifs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Didn’t we already talk about the crime of pairing fonts badly? Yes, yes we did. This specific font pairing faux pas is so criminal that it needs its own law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know how “birds of a feather flock together”? Well, fonts of a feather…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;uh, seriously do not belong together. We’re still working on the phrase, but&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the sentiment remains true! Two serif fonts together look like a messy mistake.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62accfac3f5522dd73330403_crimes-of-typography-serifs.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another easy crime to avoid– trying to pair a serif typeface and a sans-serif typeface (a typeface without serifs)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62accfca30cf98d17e5a96c9_crimes-of-typography-serifs-sans.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime #11: All Jammed Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cramming as much as you possibly can into a design doesn’t make the design better; it just makes it busier, visually overwhelming, and unprofessional-looking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s about the spacing more than it is about the amount of content, so remember to back everything off of the corners and edges unless you’re intentionally cutting something off.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62accff8e5f6c26197b40d3b_crimes-of-typography-corners.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shift your mindset&lt;/strong&gt; (and see if you can get your client to shift theirs, too)! When you start viewing negative space as a valuable part of the design and not as wasted space, you’ll find it easier and easier to let your design breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Play with space&lt;/strong&gt; - there are so many ways to achieve a cleaner look with more negative space. You can scale everything or just some things down, change the font size, or sometimes some crafty rearranging of individual elements will do the trick!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8NS7BX_Y-w&#34; title=&#34;How to Use Negative Space to Improve Your Design Layouts - Typography Tips&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime #12: Illegible Text&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this feels like a total “given,” to you… great! We love to hear that! We do think that some folks need a little reminding about this crime every now and then. If the reader can’t read the text they’re supposed to, you’re missing the mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go for function over “fashion.” When you can, absolutely go for both. We like a pretty (type)face as much as the next designer. But if you can’t achieve both functional and fashionable… choose functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, if your text doesn’t need to be readable and you’re experimenting with wacky or weird type, go off, my friend! Go. Off.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acd056c1ecedc5a8de44c3_crimes-of-typography-legibility.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime #13: Random Rules&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself explaining why things are aligned a certain way or constantly readjusting and readjusting until it “feels” right, it might be time to let go of that loosey-goosey attitude for a hot second and follow some real rules. Like, “ruler” rules.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acd3855556a76efeb2fea2_crimes-of-typography-grids.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;strong&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get yourself back on track and get your type lookin’ fresh and functional, you gotta get that big grid energy. By which we mean, get really excited about using grids. We &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/grids-and-layout&#34;&gt;have ‘em&lt;/a&gt;, we use ‘em, and we love ‘em, too!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xjAQ5CK4oqg&#34; title=&#34;🔴 How To Improve Your Layout and Typography Critique&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Crime #14: Snooze Cruise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not having fun &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; your design is a snore-fest, then nobody’s winning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not you, not your client, and certainly not the other big design nerds who can’t wait to see what you create (that’s us!).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What to do instead:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have fun with it! Design is driven by passion and curiosity just as much as it’s driven by the rules and guidelines that we’ve talked about today. And hey, part of why we learn the rules is simply to &lt;em&gt;break&lt;/em&gt; them in fun, interesting, and new ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62acd14a5556a726e4b2d1aa_crimes-of-typography-something-fun.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#39;re well on your way to crime-free design!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve covered the worst of typography crimes, we’re confident that you’re ready to trade in your life of type-crime for a life of great design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d love to join you on your journey!

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the know around here then you totally get that learning typography is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/typography-for-beginners&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;essential skill&lt;/a&gt; every designer should have. But have we mentioned just how influential it can be? Yep, yep!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to know why you should learn typography or you need some talking points for a particularly stubborn client who’s married to default styles and large blocks of text (yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; client), you’ve come to the right place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kR9_DC2Jk0&#34; title=&#34;Four Quick Tips To Improve Your Typography&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to learn the not-so-secret secrets of &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/why-is-typography-important&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;typography’s influential prowess&lt;/a&gt;? Let’s do it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Type)face Value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s first take typography at face value. When it’s done well, it just looks nice. Makes sense, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if it looks nice, we want to see more of it, we pay attention to it, and we remember it- specifically as something positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if that was all there was to the persuasive power of typography, those effects alone could tip the scales in your client’s favor and lead to higher conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t “just” look nice. If you look a little closer, there are brains behind that beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typography &lt;strong&gt;Communicates Tone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good typography influences readers by setting the right tone for the content or copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything about the text, from the softness or sharpness of the shapes in the font, to the colors, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/why-is-typography-important&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;size of the letters&lt;/a&gt;, and yes, even the number of lines and spacing in each paragraph, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/video/identity-design-branding&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tells the reader what tone of voice to read the message in.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Frank-N-Furter would say, &amp;#34;Don&amp;#39;t dream it, be it.&amp;#34; Or, in this case, create it! &lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62a391618fad341dcae33356_how-typography-influences-tone.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a reader misinterprets the intent behind what’s being said, the message will evoke an entirely different reaction than what was intended. Can you think of other typography choices the folks behind The Rocky Horror Picture Show could have used that would have completely changed the vibe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typography &lt;strong&gt;Evokes Emotion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tone of a message absolutely tells the reader how to feel, but so do… a bunch of other things!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Color Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;As designers, we have a good grasp of the art and science behind &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/color-for-creatives&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;color theory&lt;/a&gt;. When designing a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/video/charge-100x-for-logo-design&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;logo&lt;/a&gt; or interior space, for example, you consider the mood you want to set and the colors you’ll use (and avoid!) to set that mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkCVrNoqcBU?start=5&#34; title=&#34;How To Use Color - Color Basics&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply those same principles to typography and BAM! Game = changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shape and Style&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fonts can be read as more welcoming and warm than others. Serif fonts, for example, might create a more formal and serious mood than a typeface without serifs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, different styles of the same font can pull on the heartstrings, too. &lt;strong&gt;Everything changes when you change the style!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S p a c i n g&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of white space in your typography design is an incredible thing. Some clients may try to argue that it’s a “waste of space,” but trust us on this one- &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/TxaiUbGnElU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;breathing room matters!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re intentionally evoking a feeling of overwhelm, there should always be &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/ZwEMbqZDkXU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;plenty of space&lt;/a&gt; for your text and design elements to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gives the reader time to rest their eyes and lets their brain catch up before you hit them with more information. Maintaining that calm and controlled mood can also work to help the reader stay engaged longer and retain information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many emotions to evoke, so many ways to evoke them, and an abundance of fonts to choose from, we could clearly just go on and on and on. Orrrrr you could just join us in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;typography class online!&lt;/a&gt; ::wink::&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gI8fEZvwZyY&#34; title=&#34;Learn Typography: Design Course Trailer&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typography &lt;strong&gt;Establishes Credibility and Trust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For real though, the influence that typography has on the level of credibility and trustworthiness a reader assigns to your message is no laughing matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been some pretty big experiments based on this idea! About a decade ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/hear-all-ye-people-hearken-o-earth/?utm_source=slashdot&amp;amp;utm_medium=slashdot&amp;amp;utm_campaign=slashdot&amp;amp;mtrref=undefined&amp;amp;gwh=6A88299F755B3F0E48EBBD75ECA5B06C&amp;amp;gwt=pay&amp;amp;assetType=PAYWALL&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; showed the same information to 40,000 readers, but they showed it using six different font styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of the article called it a “test of the effect of typefaces on truth.” As you might’ve guessed, the different font styles made a measurable difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers who read the info in the Baskerville font style were way more likely to agree with the validity of the information. Is it at all surprising that people who read it in Comic Sans were far less likely to agree? Not a chance!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pop quiz- can you tell which is which below?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62a3930d41e1ac7924c5e057_how-typography-influences-baskerville-comic-sans.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the goal is to convert a reader into a customer or client, or if the goal is just to keep them coming back to the same site again and again, then establishing trust and credibility is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, that should be factored into the content itself, but your ability to rule the elements of typography to add to that foundation of trust for your client is what will ultimately set you apart as a designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re not saying that choosing the correct typeface is all that matters, we’re just sayin’ that we wouldn’t take career advice from someone using lobster as one of their primary display fonts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Typography Helps &lt;strong&gt;Brand Relationship and Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest things about typography’s influence on a reader is its ability to stick with them long after they click away. For a brand to be associated with beautiful design, clear communication, the right mood, and reliability is just… &lt;em&gt;chefs kiss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what you bring to the table as a designer with experience and practice in typography. Getting that experience and practice is easier and more affordable than you might think!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/video/learn-design-without-school&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;improve your craft&lt;/a&gt;?

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listen up, fellow designers- we can and absolutely should learn how to do &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/content/typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;typography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is, it doesn’t need to take years off your life or thousands of dollars to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=47e8b5XmHfQ&amp;amp;t=20s&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;add it to your design toolbox,&lt;/a&gt; yet &lt;strong&gt;it can elevate pretty much every design you do from this point on&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How it does that depends on the kind of design we’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we’re aiming for something flashy and memorable, but when it comes to typography for websites, the goal is to be SO good it’s basically unnoticeable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, for typography nerds like us, we’ll totally notice and appreciate a thoughtful design. But the best website typography design is so readable, accessible, and logical that the user doesn’t even notice it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gI8fEZvwZyY?start=58&#34; title=&#34;Learn Typography: Design Course Trailer&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So many typographic elements factor into readability. So, let’s start by talking about the “Triadic Relationship.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hold up! Before you hit the &amp;#39;back&amp;#39; button because this sounds a whole lot like math, don’t be scared. It’s actually super simple!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Triadic Relationship refers to the harmony between type sizes, line length, and interline spacing; when you adjust any one of these three, you will be helping or hurting the legibility of your text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can learn to control all of these elements beautifully in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/typography-01&#34;&gt;typography course online&lt;/a&gt;, but for now, let’s get the basics down. We’ll tackle spacing first.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spacing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few ways to adjust the spacing of your text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Letter-spacing’&lt;/strong&gt; is about adding and removing spacing between letters. Often confused with kerning (which can’t be controlled in CSS), letter-spacing impacts the entire line of text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, &lt;strong&gt;‘line-height,’&lt;/strong&gt; also known as leading, refers to the vertical distance between two lines of type. It’s measured from the baseline of one line to the baseline of the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too close together and the letters can blur into one, or the eye might return to the same line over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too far apart and the ideas being expressed seem less connected to each other which may lead to readers skimming right past the most important bits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For body text, a spacing of 1.5 is recommended. For headings and between paragraphs, spacing should be greater. Start at 2.5 and make adjustments from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great time to activate your inner Goldilocks and keep trying until you get it juuuuust right!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62995714dddf0501ea68de33_web-typography-line%20height%20body%20copy.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/6299584093880f43eaff2990_web-typography-line%20height%20headings.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Line Length&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the right line length is crucial, partly because breaking things up makes them literally easier to read, but also because the human brain is just so picky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because if someone rolls up to your site and sees line after line after line of text- they’re bouncing. Don’t make people read too much!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tend to be most comfortable with lines made up of about 40 to 60 characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any shorter and we get distracted by our eyes moving too much between lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any longer and we might get bored or even lost, trying to travel back to the beginning of the text block for the next line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t true for every person or for every type of content. There’s always wiggle room, especially when displaying your text on different types of devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ideal type size also has some flexibility. Generally, for body text on websites, you want to keep it between 16px and 20px.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsive typography automatically scales your text to the device that it’s being viewed on, so you’ll want to make sure that the style you’re using scales well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Default styles are sometimes just fine, but using larger accessibility type sizes can make your content easier to read for everyone, especially on phones or tablets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Triadic Relationship makes for legible typefaces, but there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrNi9FmdlxY&amp;amp;t=23s&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;plenty of other things at play&lt;/a&gt; in readability like using common types, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/video/what-not-to-do-with-a-design-layout&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;staying away&lt;/a&gt; from italic type if possible, and keeping it simple with as few typefaces as you can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, using different font sizes can create a logical flow to your content as well!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we can physically read the page, we’ve gotta arrange the content in a way that makes sense and makes people want to keep on scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, how do we do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/629954b874e16f7d9e0042a4_web-typography-structure_image2.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hierarchy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By breaking up our content into sections, of course! And breaking those sections up into smaller sections, and maybe breaking those up into even smaller sections... you get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mostly, it tells us which paragraphs support which points so that we can jump to the information we want to know quicker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typography translates those different levels into an implied hierarchy through the use of different font sizes, font weights, and font styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we get something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/629954dbe1b74de65a45debc_web-typography-hiearchy_image1.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it’s done well, folks don’t give a second thought to which part of the page has the information they need—instead, their eye naturally figures it out because you’ve done your typography homework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They come to the site, find the info they want, and leave knowing this is the place to be to get the right answers as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words: they’ll be back and likely act on those CTAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Navigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typography for websites is not always static.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having a clean, accessible user interface as opposed to a messy interface can influence how much time someone spends on a website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know a single page can be easier to navigate based on how clear the content is, paired with an easy-to-understand hierarchy. But is the website itself easy to navigate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does the text behave in a way that is to be expected?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, what happens when you hover over a link or click on a menu?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We suggest physically plotting out the interface before you start connecting everything on the site. Creating an accurate interface mockup for individual pages can guide your design and help you focus on a central vision.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing, Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you bring that vision to life and everything’s in place, don’t pop the champagne just yet!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You gotta test it out. Extensively. On all browsers and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A little louder for those in the back- test your work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t take this step lightly- you worked really hard to get to this point and you want to make sure that your hard work goes “unnoticed” in the finished product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to learn more?

Pretty cool, right?!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxaiUbGnElU?start=2&#34; title=&#34;How to Design with Lines and Typography&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, the results of learning how to craft and use typography may leave you with seemingly super-hero powers, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/learning-how-to-use-typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;getting started&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have to be a herculean task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With just a few basic principles, you’ll be well on your way to totally ruling type [insert celebration emoji here] Woo!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrNi9FmdlxY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typography 101&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with typography goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before considering the aesthetics of typeface design, we have to return to the very &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/why-is-typography-important&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;basic goals of your type&lt;/a&gt;. No matter the style or the type family, no matter your approach to typeface selection, you want your text to be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Clear (not confusing)&lt;br/&gt;2. Interesting (not boring)&lt;br/&gt;3. Communicating an idea&lt;br/&gt;4. Detailed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are your goals. And every decision you make in relation to your type should move the design closer to a clear and interesting message with attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, perfectionists FTW!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kR9_DC2Jk0&#34; title=&#34;Four Quick Tips To Improve Your Typography&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seems simple enough, right?It tracks, then, that the easiest way to fulfill these criteria is to start simple.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Is Strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I know you wanna throw every mother-loving font into a design because you love them ALL. But that just ain’t gonna cut it. Restraint, friends. Restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing two different typefaces or font types is like pairing a good wine with your dinner. It’s a delicate art that requires a deep understanding of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you master working with one font, one font size, one weight, and one color, then you can start tweaking those elements to play with contrast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem like tedious work at first but the payoff is pretty friggin’ sweet. So hang in there, you go this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the rebels in the crowd, you could just say, ‘fuhgeddaboudit’ and throw a bunch of doodads against the wall to see what sticks. Up to you! But for now, let’s move along to font types.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Major Font Types&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are heaps of fonts to choose from, but they all fall into four main categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Serif fonts&lt;br/&gt;2. Sans-Serif fonts (fonts and typefaces without serifs)&lt;br/&gt;3. Script fonts&lt;br/&gt;4. Display fonts&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/629948d2b78c5b622a9fb5fc_typography%20for%20beginners_image1.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/629948e4f660670de4260b0d_typography%20for%20beginners_image2.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also tons of subcategories for each of these types, but for this short typography tutorial, we’re sticking to the basics. Remember, start simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve selected the single font you’re going to use, it’s time to play with contrast.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contrast Is King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard that content is king, yes? But when we’re talking about typographic elements, it’s &lt;em&gt;contrast&lt;/em&gt; that rules the roost. Cock-a-doodle-do, baby!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can’t have contrast if you’re only using one font, can you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is yes. Yes, you can.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/6299491c6a89ac21759e610d_Typography%20for%20Beginners_Image3.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can create contrast within a single typeface to keep things interesting, without making your design too noisy or distracting.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip A Weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create contrast, pick two weights that look significantly different. Thin and regular are often too similar, as are regular and bold. So what do you do? You skip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick your two fonts from different ends of the spectrum and skip the weights in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/6299494f2f5dfa978ea01308_Typography%20for%20Beginners_Image4.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple change in case size can change EVERYTHING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set different types of content apart by changing the case. Just be sure that you’re using the correct typeface for your design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uppercase letters tend to take up more space and can become harder to read than lowercase letters.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double The Point Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoutout to the drama queens and kings among us- it’s your time to shine! Get ready to tap into your inner Mariah, Kardashian, or Cruise to create some drama through…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…varying. type. sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ooooh yes, that seggsy type-size drama, baby!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can do this by working your way up the type scale in doubles. For example, if you’re using a 24-point font, you would use 48-point font for contrast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62994992626c99d1efbd1d2e_Typography%20for%20Beginners_Image5.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Line Breaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way you can play with type as a beginner is by experimenting with different line breaks. Line breaks can be used subtly,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in poetry,To make the reader pause,Where you want,Them to.Line breaks can also be drama-tic to create tension and opportunities for wordplay.There’s really so much you can do with just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; typeface!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping It Legible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the love of all things holy in this world- keep your type legible. This isn’t an art contest. It’s communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while you’re making these adjustments, here are some guidelines and concepts to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Triadic Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This refers to the harmony between type size, line length, and interline spacing; when you adjust any one of these three, you will be helping or hurting the legibility of your text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Spacing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T   o   o    m   u   c   h  or toolittle spacing between letters can make the text difficult to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Font Point Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, the most legible font point sizes for body text in print are between 9-12px, and for screens, it&amp;#39;s 16-12px.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A font that is either too light or &lt;strong&gt;too heavy&lt;/strong&gt; in weight can reduce readability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Style&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italics should be used carefully and sparingly, as they can &lt;em&gt;slow a reader down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Alignment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the rule of “flush left, rag right” allows for overall readability in a paragraph; in the Western world, we read left to right, so having text aligned to the left feels natural and effortless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7.&lt;strong&gt; Indentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not indent the first line of your text; we know that’s not what we’re taught in academia, but this is design, and design demands efficiency and efficacy. Bada-bing bada-boom!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are so many &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/what-is-typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;aspects of typography&lt;/a&gt; to consider and whole &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzVl_ATHUQ0&amp;amp;t=3s&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;alphabets of terms&lt;/a&gt; to learn.

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re in the know around here then you totally get that learning typography is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/typography-for-beginners&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;essential skill&lt;/a&gt; every designer should have. But have we mentioned just how influential it can be? Yep, yep!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you want to know why you should learn typography or you need some talking points for a particularly stubborn client who’s married to default styles and large blocks of text (yes, &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; client), you’ve come to the right place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kR9_DC2Jk0&#34; title=&#34;Four Quick Tips To Improve Your Typography&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to learn the not-so-secret secrets of &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/why-is-typography-important&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;typography’s influential prowess&lt;/a&gt;? Let’s do it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;(Type)face Value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s first take typography at face value. When it’s done well, it just looks nice. Makes sense, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if it looks nice, we want to see more of it, we pay attention to it, and we remember it- specifically as something positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if that was all there was to the persuasive power of typography, those effects alone could tip the scales in your client’s favor and lead to higher conversion rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it doesn’t “just” look nice. If you look a little closer, there are brains behind that beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typography &lt;strong&gt;Communicates Tone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Good typography influences readers by setting the right tone for the content or copy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything about the text, from the softness or sharpness of the shapes in the font, to the colors, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/why-is-typography-important&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;size of the letters&lt;/a&gt;, and yes, even the number of lines and spacing in each paragraph, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/video/identity-design-branding&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;tells the reader what tone of voice to read the message in.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Frank-N-Furter would say, &amp;#34;Don&amp;#39;t dream it, be it.&amp;#34; Or, in this case, create it! &lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62a391618fad341dcae33356_how-typography-influences-tone.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a reader misinterprets the intent behind what’s being said, the message will evoke an entirely different reaction than what was intended. Can you think of other typography choices the folks behind The Rocky Horror Picture Show could have used that would have completely changed the vibe?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typography &lt;strong&gt;Evokes Emotion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tone of a message absolutely tells the reader how to feel, but so do… a bunch of other things!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Color Theory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;As designers, we have a good grasp of the art and science behind &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/color-for-creatives&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;color theory&lt;/a&gt;. When designing a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/video/charge-100x-for-logo-design&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;logo&lt;/a&gt; or interior space, for example, you consider the mood you want to set and the colors you’ll use (and avoid!) to set that mood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkCVrNoqcBU?start=5&#34; title=&#34;How To Use Color - Color Basics&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply those same principles to typography and BAM! Game = changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shape and Style&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some fonts can be read as more welcoming and warm than others. Serif fonts, for example, might create a more formal and serious mood than a typeface without serifs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, of course, different styles of the same font can pull on the heartstrings, too. &lt;strong&gt;Everything changes when you change the style!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S p a c i n g&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The use of white space in your typography design is an incredible thing. Some clients may try to argue that it’s a “waste of space,” but trust us on this one- &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/TxaiUbGnElU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;breathing room matters!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re intentionally evoking a feeling of overwhelm, there should always be &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/ZwEMbqZDkXU&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;plenty of space&lt;/a&gt; for your text and design elements to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This gives the reader time to rest their eyes and lets their brain catch up before you hit them with more information. Maintaining that calm and controlled mood can also work to help the reader stay engaged longer and retain information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With so many emotions to evoke, so many ways to evoke them, and an abundance of fonts to choose from, we could clearly just go on and on and on. Orrrrr you could just join us in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;typography class online!&lt;/a&gt; ::wink::&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gI8fEZvwZyY&#34; title=&#34;Learn Typography: Design Course Trailer&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Typography &lt;strong&gt;Establishes Credibility and Trust&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For real though, the influence that typography has on the level of credibility and trustworthiness a reader assigns to your message is no laughing matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been some pretty big experiments based on this idea! About a decade ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/hear-all-ye-people-hearken-o-earth/?utm_source=slashdot&amp;amp;utm_medium=slashdot&amp;amp;utm_campaign=slashdot&amp;amp;mtrref=undefined&amp;amp;gwh=6A88299F755B3F0E48EBBD75ECA5B06C&amp;amp;gwt=pay&amp;amp;assetType=PAYWALL&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;the New York Times&lt;/a&gt; showed the same information to 40,000 readers, but they showed it using six different font styles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of the article called it a “test of the effect of typefaces on truth.” As you might’ve guessed, the different font styles made a measurable difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers who read the info in the Baskerville font style were way more likely to agree with the validity of the information. Is it at all surprising that people who read it in Comic Sans were far less likely to agree? Not a chance!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pop quiz- can you tell which is which below?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62a3930d41e1ac7924c5e057_how-typography-influences-baskerville-comic-sans.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the goal is to convert a reader into a customer or client, or if the goal is just to keep them coming back to the same site again and again, then establishing trust and credibility is critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sure, that should be factored into the content itself, but your ability to rule the elements of typography to add to that foundation of trust for your client is what will ultimately set you apart as a designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re not saying that choosing the correct typeface is all that matters, we’re just sayin’ that we wouldn’t take career advice from someone using lobster as one of their primary display fonts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Typography Helps &lt;strong&gt;Brand Relationship and Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the coolest things about typography’s influence on a reader is its ability to stick with them long after they click away. For a brand to be associated with beautiful design, clear communication, the right mood, and reliability is just… &lt;em&gt;chefs kiss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what you bring to the table as a designer with experience and practice in typography. Getting that experience and practice is easier and more affordable than you might think!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ready to &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/video/learn-design-without-school&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;improve your craft&lt;/a&gt;?

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear friends, when we say that learning the art of &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/content/typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;typography&lt;/a&gt; will elevate your design career, we mean it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learning how to do typography&lt;/a&gt; will help you design some seriously stunning text, of course, but it does so much more than that!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, grab a pen and paper… or your computer, and get ready to take some notes!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlocking The Mysteries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDVLjs0Z02o&amp;amp;list=PLroLjS4HDi0A9Vhx0Ww28ljL5932wmEDn&amp;amp;index=5&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;To understand type&lt;/a&gt; is to understand the fundamentals of space and proportion, so it’s really no surprise that you can then apply this knowledge of typography to other areas of design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you believe that Chris has even used what he’s learned about typography to design furniture? Pretty cool, right?!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/TxaiUbGnElU?start=2&#34; title=&#34;How to Design with Lines and Typography&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, the results of learning how to craft and use typography may leave you with seemingly super-hero powers, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/learning-how-to-use-typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;getting started&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t have to be a herculean task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With just a few basic principles, you’ll be well on your way to totally ruling type [insert celebration emoji here] Woo!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrNi9FmdlxY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typography 101&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with typography goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before considering the aesthetics of typeface design, we have to return to the very &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/why-is-typography-important&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;basic goals of your type&lt;/a&gt;. No matter the style or the type family, no matter your approach to typeface selection, you want your text to be:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Clear (not confusing)&lt;br/&gt;2. Interesting (not boring)&lt;br/&gt;3. Communicating an idea&lt;br/&gt;4. Detailed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are your goals. And every decision you make in relation to your type should move the design closer to a clear and interesting message with attention to detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, perfectionists FTW!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kR9_DC2Jk0&#34; title=&#34;Four Quick Tips To Improve Your Typography&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Seems simple enough, right?It tracks, then, that the easiest way to fulfill these criteria is to start simple.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Is Strong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now I know you wanna throw every mother-loving font into a design because you love them ALL. But that just ain’t gonna cut it. Restraint, friends. Restraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pairing two different typefaces or font types is like pairing a good wine with your dinner. It’s a delicate art that requires a deep understanding of the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you master working with one font, one font size, one weight, and one color, then you can start tweaking those elements to play with contrast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may seem like tedious work at first but the payoff is pretty friggin’ sweet. So hang in there, you go this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the rebels in the crowd, you could just say, ‘fuhgeddaboudit’ and throw a bunch of doodads against the wall to see what sticks. Up to you! But for now, let’s move along to font types.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 Major Font Types&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are heaps of fonts to choose from, but they all fall into four main categories:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Serif fonts&lt;br/&gt;2. Sans-Serif fonts (fonts and typefaces without serifs)&lt;br/&gt;3. Script fonts&lt;br/&gt;4. Display fonts&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/629948d2b78c5b622a9fb5fc_typography%20for%20beginners_image1.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/629948e4f660670de4260b0d_typography%20for%20beginners_image2.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There are also tons of subcategories for each of these types, but for this short typography tutorial, we’re sticking to the basics. Remember, start simple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve selected the single font you’re going to use, it’s time to play with contrast.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contrast Is King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve heard that content is king, yes? But when we’re talking about typographic elements, it’s &lt;em&gt;contrast&lt;/em&gt; that rules the roost. Cock-a-doodle-do, baby!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you can’t have contrast if you’re only using one font, can you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer is yes. Yes, you can.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/6299491c6a89ac21759e610d_Typography%20for%20Beginners_Image3.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;You can create contrast within a single typeface to keep things interesting, without making your design too noisy or distracting.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skip A Weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To create contrast, pick two weights that look significantly different. Thin and regular are often too similar, as are regular and bold. So what do you do? You skip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pick your two fonts from different ends of the spectrum and skip the weights in the middle.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/6299494f2f5dfa978ea01308_Typography%20for%20Beginners_Image4.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A simple change in case size can change EVERYTHING.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set different types of content apart by changing the case. Just be sure that you’re using the correct typeface for your design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uppercase letters tend to take up more space and can become harder to read than lowercase letters.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Double The Point Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoutout to the drama queens and kings among us- it’s your time to shine! Get ready to tap into your inner Mariah, Kardashian, or Cruise to create some drama through…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;…varying. type. sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ooooh yes, that seggsy type-size drama, baby!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can do this by working your way up the type scale in doubles. For example, if you’re using a 24-point font, you would use 48-point font for contrast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/62994992626c99d1efbd1d2e_Typography%20for%20Beginners_Image5.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Line Breaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way you can play with type as a beginner is by experimenting with different line breaks. Line breaks can be used subtly,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in poetry,To make the reader pause,Where you want,Them to.Line breaks can also be drama-tic to create tension and opportunities for wordplay.There’s really so much you can do with just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; typeface!&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keeping It Legible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the love of all things holy in this world- keep your type legible. This isn’t an art contest. It’s communication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, while you’re making these adjustments, here are some guidelines and concepts to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Triadic Relationship&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This refers to the harmony between type size, line length, and interline spacing; when you adjust any one of these three, you will be helping or hurting the legibility of your text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Spacing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;T   o   o    m   u   c   h  or toolittle spacing between letters can make the text difficult to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Font Point Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In general, the most legible font point sizes for body text in print are between 9-12px, and for screens, it&amp;#39;s 16-12px.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Weight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A font that is either too light or &lt;strong&gt;too heavy&lt;/strong&gt; in weight can reduce readability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Style&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italics should be used carefully and sparingly, as they can &lt;em&gt;slow a reader down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. &lt;strong&gt;Alignment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the rule of “flush left, rag right” allows for overall readability in a paragraph; in the Western world, we read left to right, so having text aligned to the left feels natural and effortless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7.&lt;strong&gt; Indentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not indent the first line of your text; we know that’s not what we’re taught in academia, but this is design, and design demands efficiency and efficacy.

    <title>What Is Typography?</title>
    <updated>2022-05-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2022-05-16:/blog/what-is-typography</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typography is only one of the coolest (and most important) things you can learn how to use as a designer! No big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For real though- having evolved from handwriting, typography is absolutely everywhere and anywhere words exist. It’s in the words you see on websites, in books, on signs, and products, packaging, logos, graphics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; typography exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very core, typography is the style, design, or appearance of text. This includes everything from font type and size to texture and spacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typography touches every **aspect of a business from its style guides, to brand messaging, visual design, and marketing efforts. &lt;strong&gt;It’s the foundation of how we communicate with other human beings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to influence a user’s emotions, or make their experience a million times better because your original typeface made it clearer or more accessible for them. That’s the power of typography!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is why, as a designer, it’s important for you to learn the craft of typography—to truly understand how to best use such an influential and key component of design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re ready to &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/video/how-to-improve-your-layout-and-typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;improve your typography skills and critique&lt;/a&gt; and create visually stunning, impactful work, it’s time to finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/learn-typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;commit to learning typography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gI8fEZvwZyY&#34; title=&#34;Learn Typography: Design Course Trailer&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Different Elements of Typography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in, shall we? &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learning typography design&lt;/a&gt; begins with a few basic elements: contrast, scale, repetition, and composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6dfab2b04c4a1624163c_what-is-typography-contrast.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast: Pairing opposites together in harmony. Like small text with large text, thick typefaces with thin typefaces, etc. How do you make sure you’re contrasting and &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; clashing?

We’ve put together a list of typography terms that every designer should know:&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WzVl_ATHUQ0&#34; title=&#34;Typographic Terminology A to Z: Our list of typography terms that every designer should know.&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now that we’ve got you talking type, it’s time to put those terms into context.

There’s a good reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6ea8b95e771365b38141_what-is-typography-attention.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novelty sparks a chemical reaction in the brain, essentially rewarding us for looking at and experiencing new things. This might be more evident in, say, unlocking a new secret level of your favorite video game, but it plays a large role in the way we intake information, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-designed typography can not only grab the attention of the reader, but it has the ability to impact how they feel the moment they see your work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why knowing how to use text in space is vital. Is your content featured on the page in a way that makes sense while also being aesthetically pleasing and visually interesting? Does it encourage the eye to keep moving or does it allow the focus to fade?&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typography Influences Decision Making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without question, typography is an invaluable marketing tool that can move your reader from vague interest to urgent need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-designed typography helps establish authority for a brand and encourages trust for the reader, which certainly influences their decision to interact with the brand further. Would you trust an online bank that uses comic sans? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6eb812738f74d3bc4d0c_what-is-typography-personality.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novelty that grabbed their attention in the first place will keep your reader moving from one sentence to the next, eager to learn about the brand, products, or services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sweet, sweet combo of curiosity and trust is pretty powerful and it makes a brand unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, all of this is the secret sauce that kicks your design work up a notch (or ten)! &lt;strong&gt;Good copy is effective, but when the art matches the message THAT is when the magic happens.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know this- some fonts just feel fun, light, or exciting. Others feel quirky, serious, or sophisticated. It’s pretty cool just how much things like the texture, curve, or spacing of letters or groups of words can make you feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6ec9f6d387209aec046d_what-is-typography-personality-2.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the sake of continuity, it’s important to remember that your typography choices must match the brand’s personality or mission, and be consistent everywhere typography shows up for the business or brand—depicting the personality that it was created for, across all touchpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself, what design choices can you make to achieve this? What’s missing? What needs to change?&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to how typography can really bring out a brand’s personality, it can also supercharge the mood and visual tone of the particular message you are trying to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When designing or choosing typography fonts to help establish or reinforce the tone of a message, it really comes down to subtle details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6f421d599f6bb5e7c01a_what-is-typography-tone.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, fonts that have bizarro or unconventional edges can either give a fun, quirky tone versus others that may feel more classical or whimsical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a more serious or professional tone, you might look at a compressed sans-serif or a simple, traditional font. Or maybe you get wild and let a couple of mismatched type families get together to co-create spunky, unexpected compositions or layouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, picking typefaces is only ONE part of how you can influence things. Lining things up in a grid versus randomly aligning things; using huge chunky text for what would normally be paragraph text; playing with contrast, weights, and line breaks- these are all ways to communicate personality and tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick note:&lt;/strong&gt; you don’t need to go back to college to learn how different styles communicate different tones; your typography 101 is right here: hop into &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our typography course to get started now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attractive, appealing text shouldn’t distract us from what text &lt;em&gt;must be&lt;/em&gt;. And that is, functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user needs to be able to read the text, which requires a &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/EozQvV3oQ7c&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;legible typeface&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As pretty as some of the more intricate decorative typefaces are, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a struggle to see or understand your design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re selecting your typeface and fonts—or designing an original one—think about whether or not they will display correctly on any device and any browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few places where you can easily test your display cross-browser and cross-device. Websites like BrowserStack offer a number of free and paid testing services to make sure your typography is doin’ its thang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6f77d1917c4e6b6f1294_what-is-typography-legible.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessible typography is effective typography.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also really important to think about in terms of user interface design. What happens to text when you hover over it or click on it? Is there a clear and clean hierarchy that’s easy to follow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can feel a little overwhelming to make all these large and small-scale design choices. That’s why we recommend starting simple to start strong- selecting just one or two typefaces, to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what should your approach to typeface selection be? Great question! Check out this &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/resources/typography-manual&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;free typography manual&lt;/a&gt; to get started today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to really dig in, jumping into &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our typography class online&lt;/a&gt; will help you take back control over a messy interface and really rule type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember, if you don’t control type, type controls you.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fonts and Typefaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the words themselves are often used interchangeably, font and typeface are actually different. It’s subtle but as a designer working with and crafting type, it’s important to know the distinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typeface is a style of lettering. A font is a variation of a typeface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6fba9313204a63c08feb_what-is-typography-typeface%2520vs%2520font.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fonts to Avoid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considering the role that function, tone, and personality play when selecting a font, it follows that there are some fonts that, for many reasons, should be outright avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficult to read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6fcdd2c3d132b8bc923b_what-is-typography-diffcult%2520to%2520read.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distracting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6fd917c3873e5c52ac68_what-is-typography-distracting.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overused:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6fe7c75c2e3c663e93b3_what-is-typography-overrused.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we’re not saying that it’s never appropriate to use any of these fonts &lt;em&gt;ever.&lt;/em&gt; In general, though, for eye-catching and effective messaging, you’ll want to steer clear of these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But don&amp;#39;t forget to break the rules!&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, yeah, we’ve been going on and on about what you should or shouldn’t do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you’re a designer. So, design!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have fun, do things differently, push the ol’ envelope and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typography rules are really more rules of thumb or best practices. There’s still room for you to get creative with it, friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the best part?

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typography is only one of the coolest (and most important) things you can learn how to use as a designer! No big deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For real though- having evolved from handwriting, typography is absolutely everywhere and anywhere words exist. It’s in the words you see on websites, in books, on signs, and products, packaging, logos, graphics, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; typography exactly?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the very core, typography is the style, design, or appearance of text. This includes everything from font type and size to texture and spacing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typography touches every **aspect of a business from its style guides, to brand messaging, visual design, and marketing efforts. &lt;strong&gt;It’s the foundation of how we communicate with other human beings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine being able to influence a user’s emotions, or make their experience a million times better because your original typeface made it clearer or more accessible for them. That’s the power of typography!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this is why, as a designer, it’s important for you to learn the craft of typography—to truly understand how to best use such an influential and key component of design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if you’re ready to &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/video/how-to-improve-your-layout-and-typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;improve your typography skills and critique&lt;/a&gt; and create visually stunning, impactful work, it’s time to finally &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/learn-typography&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;commit to learning typography&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gI8fEZvwZyY&#34; title=&#34;Learn Typography: Design Course Trailer&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Different Elements of Typography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in, shall we? &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learning typography design&lt;/a&gt; begins with a few basic elements: contrast, scale, repetition, and composition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6dfab2b04c4a1624163c_what-is-typography-contrast.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast: Pairing opposites together in harmony.

There’s a good reason for that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6ea8b95e771365b38141_what-is-typography-attention.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novelty sparks a chemical reaction in the brain, essentially rewarding us for looking at and experiencing new things. This might be more evident in, say, unlocking a new secret level of your favorite video game, but it plays a large role in the way we intake information, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-designed typography can not only grab the attention of the reader, but it has the ability to impact how they feel the moment they see your work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is why knowing how to use text in space is vital. Is your content featured on the page in a way that makes sense while also being aesthetically pleasing and visually interesting? Does it encourage the eye to keep moving or does it allow the focus to fade?&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Typography Influences Decision Making&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without question, typography is an invaluable marketing tool that can move your reader from vague interest to urgent need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-designed typography helps establish authority for a brand and encourages trust for the reader, which certainly influences their decision to interact with the brand further. Would you trust an online bank that uses comic sans? Probably not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6eb812738f74d3bc4d0c_what-is-typography-personality.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novelty that grabbed their attention in the first place will keep your reader moving from one sentence to the next, eager to learn about the brand, products, or services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sweet, sweet combo of curiosity and trust is pretty powerful and it makes a brand unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, all of this is the secret sauce that kicks your design work up a notch (or ten)! &lt;strong&gt;Good copy is effective, but when the art matches the message THAT is when the magic happens.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know this- some fonts just feel fun, light, or exciting. Others feel quirky, serious, or sophisticated. It’s pretty cool just how much things like the texture, curve, or spacing of letters or groups of words can make you feel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6ec9f6d387209aec046d_what-is-typography-personality-2.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the sake of continuity, it’s important to remember that your typography choices must match the brand’s personality or mission, and be consistent everywhere typography shows up for the business or brand—depicting the personality that it was created for, across all touchpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself, what design choices can you make to achieve this? What’s missing? What needs to change?&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to how typography can really bring out a brand’s personality, it can also supercharge the mood and visual tone of the particular message you are trying to create.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When designing or choosing typography fonts to help establish or reinforce the tone of a message, it really comes down to subtle details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6f421d599f6bb5e7c01a_what-is-typography-tone.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, fonts that have bizarro or unconventional edges can either give a fun, quirky tone versus others that may feel more classical or whimsical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a more serious or professional tone, you might look at a compressed sans-serif or a simple, traditional font. Or maybe you get wild and let a couple of mismatched type families get together to co-create spunky, unexpected compositions or layouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, picking typefaces is only ONE part of how you can influence things. Lining things up in a grid versus randomly aligning things; using huge chunky text for what would normally be paragraph text; playing with contrast, weights, and line breaks- these are all ways to communicate personality and tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick note:&lt;/strong&gt; you don’t need to go back to college to learn how different styles communicate different tones; your typography 101 is right here: hop into &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our typography course to get started now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attractive, appealing text shouldn’t distract us from what text &lt;em&gt;must be&lt;/em&gt;. And that is, functional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user needs to be able to read the text, which requires a &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/EozQvV3oQ7c&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;legible typeface&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As pretty as some of the more intricate decorative typefaces are, it shouldn&amp;#39;t be a struggle to see or understand your design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re selecting your typeface and fonts—or designing an original one—think about whether or not they will display correctly on any device and any browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few places where you can easily test your display cross-browser and cross-device. Websites like BrowserStack offer a number of free and paid testing services to make sure your typography is doin’ its thang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6f77d1917c4e6b6f1294_what-is-typography-legible.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessible typography is effective typography.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also really important to think about in terms of user interface design. What happens to text when you hover over it or click on it? Is there a clear and clean hierarchy that’s easy to follow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can feel a little overwhelming to make all these large and small-scale design choices. That’s why we recommend starting simple to start strong- selecting just one or two typefaces, to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what should your approach to typeface selection be? Great question! Check out this &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/resources/typography-manual&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;free typography manual&lt;/a&gt; to get started today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re ready to really dig in, jumping into &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our typography class online&lt;/a&gt; will help you take back control over a messy interface and really rule type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remember, if you don’t control type, type controls you.&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fonts and Typefaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the words themselves are often used interchangeably, font and typeface are actually different. It’s subtle but as a designer working with and crafting type, it’s important to know the distinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A typeface is a style of lettering. A font is a variation of a typeface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6fba9313204a63c08feb_what-is-typography-typeface%2520vs%2520font.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Fonts to Avoid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When considering the role that function, tone, and personality play when selecting a font, it follows that there are some fonts that, for many reasons, should be outright avoided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Difficult to read:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6fcdd2c3d132b8bc923b_what-is-typography-diffcult%2520to%2520read.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distracting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6fd917c3873e5c52ac68_what-is-typography-distracting.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overused:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/627e6fe7c75c2e3c663e93b3_what-is-typography-overrused.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be clear, we’re not saying that it’s never appropriate to use any of these fonts &lt;em&gt;ever.&lt;/em&gt; In general, though, for eye-catching and effective messaging, you’ll want to steer clear of these.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But don&amp;#39;t forget to break the rules!&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, yeah, we’ve been going on and on about what you should or shouldn’t do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you’re a designer. So, design!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have fun, do things differently, push the ol’ envelope and see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typography rules are really more rules of thumb or best practices. There’s still room for you to get creative with it, friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the best part? Learning typography not only improves your typography skills but also makes you a better designer overall.

    <title>Futur Book List on Doing the Work</title>

These five books on productivity and focus will help you get through the valleys when things get tough and you feel like quitting or starting over on something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overaching themes covered in these books: things start out fun, but quickly get tough. This is when most people will quit. Seth Godin refers to this as being in &amp;#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3Cq7O6a&#34;&gt;the dip&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#34; where effort and time no longer produce the same results. He argues that once you decide to commit, see it all the way through. Difficult things are hard to achieve and therefore create scarcity. Scare things are valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan Holiday&amp;#39;s book &amp;#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3tCCWv3&#34;&gt;The Obstacle is the Way&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#34; reflects on the Stoics (Ancient Greek philosopher Marcus Aurelius&amp;#39; &amp;#34;Thoughts on Meditation&amp;#34;). It&amp;#39;s a more philosophical approach on why you should learn to love difficult things. He argues that in failure are a complete set of instructions on how to succeed. It is only through failure and difficulty do we learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/35wgxrr&#34;&gt;The Compound Effect&amp;#34;&lt;/a&gt; written by Darren Hardy is the seminal classic about compounded interest. Small, smart choices, applied consistently over time can have dramatic results. Big things have humble beginnings. By doing the work everyday, you essentially commit yourself to making small, almost imperceptible progress towards your goal. He also says if you only take one thing from the book, take 100% responsibility for everything in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gery Keller is already wealthy and super successful. He is the founder of Keller Williams, which is the largest real estate company in the world. What wisdom does he have to share from his success? Focus. Have a priority not priorities. The book, &lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3hK6Esm&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;The ONE Thing&amp;#34;&lt;/a&gt; is very actionable in helping you to identify your ONE thing—whereby doing your one thing, everything else becomes easier or unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, &amp;#34;&lt;a href=&#34;https://amzn.to/3hJBe5y&#34;&gt;Rework&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#34;, written by Jason Fried and David Heinmeier Hansson, takes a counter intuitive approach to work. Read the other books, then read this book as there are several business ideas and applications to put in to practice what you learn. Some nuggets from this book: Do less, planning is guessing, kill the to-do list, out teach the competition, think like a chef, small bets vs one big gamble, ignore the details early on, sell your by-products, pick a fight, say no by default and welcome obscurity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Logo Design Pricing: The Ultimate Guide</title>
    <updated>2021-04-26T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In Our Ultimate Guide to Logo Design Pricing You’ll Learn:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;What pricing to expect if you’re in need of a new logo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How clients choose who’s the best designer for the job&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determining how much you need to charge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three different logo design pricing models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to anchor and bracket your logo design pricing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What to do when a client says your price is too high&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to handle calls with low-budget clients&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to raise your logo design pricing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to increase demand for your creative services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a logo designer and looking for ways to price your other creative services?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then this guide is for you, too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we say logo, just insert whatever you provide: copywriting, UX/UI design, social media marketing- you name it and this guide will help you price it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to Expect When Paying for a Logo (For the Clients)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re a business owner and stumbled upon this article hoping to find some info on how much a logo will set you back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome- we’re happy you’re here!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we want you to think about (beyond your budget- we’ll get to that) is why do you need a logo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What business problem are you hoping this new logo will solve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will you measure the success of the logo once it’s implemented?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And speaking of implementation, where is this logo going to go? Will you need additional logo variations, a new color and typeface system, illustrations and patterns, and a brand style guide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you go searching for a logo designer and wondering the price, think about the added value that this logo will bring to your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, look for designers who not only have the portfolio that speaks to your business but also talk with you about the problems the logo will solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more value the logo and possible new identity system brings to your business, the more you can expect to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designers at Fiverr are not going to worry about solving big business problems. They’re just going to give you a logo that may (or may not) meet your business goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if your new logo isn’t going to solve a big business problem, is it even worth it to have a new logo designed? Is there any other area in your business that needs more attention? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s say this new identity system is really going to move your business forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there’s a disconnect between the image you’re achieving and the image you want to portray to attract new customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that’s worth paying attention to!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how much will it cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really depends on the designer- their experience, their level of specialization in a particular style or industry, and their demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really could be anywhere from $3,000 for a single logo mark to $100,000+ for a new identity system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to look to sites like Behance and Google &amp;#34;brand identity designers&amp;#34; in your particular industry to find the right designer to help you achieve your business goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you end up going with Fiverr, just remember- you get what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Clients Choose Who Will Design Their Logo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it that some designers are able to charge ten and even one hundred times more than others for a logo design?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve got to start thinking about the value that the logo will bring to the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one end of the client spectrum are large corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of risk involved on their end when it comes to implementing the new logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if something goes wrong? Think of all the places that logo could be placed and printed and how much money’s at stake if the rebrand doesn’t go well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a new logo and brand identity doesn’t necessarily guarantee a positive impact on the company, it can definitely have a negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So corporations are looking for the least risky option. They’re looking for agencies and designers with a track record of success with the type of logo design they need and they will have higher budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, not charging enough with these companies will make you look risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now on the other end of the spectrum are the mom and pop shops. Smaller businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logos might only appear on a website and a few other touch points, such as signage and social media- maybe a bit of packaging but they won’t have a large printing budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these types of businesses, the risk isn’t as high because if the logo design goes wrong, the fix is easier. So the logo isn’t as valuable. Meaning the budget won’t be as high- they’ll be looking for designers with lower logo design pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if you’re pricing with smaller mom and pop shops or large corporations, all clients want to know that you’re the least risky option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want a deep dive with Chris Do on logo design pricing? Then check out this popular video where he discusses how you can start talking business with your design clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because clients want to know you know business and not just logo design if you’re going to command a higher rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKXZ7t_RiOE&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How can you show that you’re the least risky option?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients will be looking at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social proof&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Referrals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Case studies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expertise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Credit history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Determining Your Minimum Level of Engagement for Logo Design Pricing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve gone over what the client needs, now let’s talk about what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gone are your days of just slapping a price on a logo based on a gut feeling and then lowering it as soon as a potential client says it’s too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve got bills to pay!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re going to figure out your minimum level of engagement for design projects so you’ll know exactly what you need to bring in with each project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here’s the quick and dirty way to determine your minimum level of engagement:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add up all your overhead for a month- how much does it cost to keep the business up and running?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add in your own pay- how much will you take home every month? This should cover your personal expenses and then some- ‘cause creatives gotta have some fun!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Account for monthly taxes or they’ll come back to bite you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now add in profit- how much do you want to have left over at the end of the month?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now multiply by 12. That’s how much you need to bring in in one year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine how many projects you can realistically complete in a year. Divide your yearly revenue goal by the number of projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now you have your minimum level of engagement- you know the lowest amount each project you take on should cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s look at three logo design pricing models for you to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Logo Design Pricing Model #1: Inputs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of pricing inputs as your hourly or day rate and then some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We call it cost plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because you really should be charging your hourly or day rate, plus your overhead, miscellaneous fees, and adding on room for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this can get a bit confusing and isn’t something we recommend for logo design pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in this method, we have a video from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt; archives in which Chris Do walks members through how to create an inputs-based bid for a motion graphics project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OiUOaZJJYzg?start=373&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like we said, this isn’t what we recommend for logo design pricing because charging by the hour or by the day often penalizes you for being efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s move on to a logo design pricing model that will be much more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Logo Design Pricing Model #2: Outputs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the logo design pricing model that will most likely be the easiest to wrap your head around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You and the client determine the scope of work and you&amp;#39;re paid for those deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is great if you’re efficient- you can get the work done quickly, not have to worry about an hourly rate, and can move on to the next job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing by outputs will come back to haunt you if you don’t have a contract in place that specifically states how many logo options and revisions the client will receive, along with other terms and conditions surrounding how long clients have to send in revision requests and if there will be any overages if the project goes off-schedule due to the client not getting back to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do you determine the cost of your outputs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refer back to your minimum level of engagement!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to give the client more pricing options? Then check out the section in this article on price bracketing your logo designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Logo Design Pricing Model #3: Value-Based&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s just imagine a client scenario for a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that a local bakery gives you a call looking for a logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re just getting started and have a limited budget but really want to get this logo right. It’ll go on their website, their signage, and stickers for their minimal packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you give a price of $5000 and they accept. All is right in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the next day an organic food market gives you a call. They have a new line of juices that will need identity design. They’ll need multiple variations for the different juices in the product lineup, which will be rolled out to all their locations nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you give them the same price?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could very well lose the job if you price too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where value-based pricing comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Value-based logo design pricing means you price the client and not the project.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You start considering the value that this design project will bring to the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means you’re going to need to have a conversation with your potential clients about their desired future state and how this logo fits into their business goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to start asking questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Why are you giving us a call?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Why do you think you need a new logo?” Start writing down their problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Anything else?” Keep drilling it down so they uncover all the problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“How will we measure that these goals are being met?” You want to determine their success metrics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“How much increased revenue are you hoping this initiative will bring to the company?” Get it down to a number.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“What percentage of this number are you thinking to invest?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where you and the client can start having a conversation around whether or not that percentage is disproportionate to the amount of value the logo (or any other creative service) will provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if a client says their identity design isn’t connecting with their target audience and they’re hoping to grow their revenue by $500,000 in the next year and they only want to spend $1000 on a new identity design, that’s only 0.2%! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems a bit disproportionate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This opens up the conversation to negotiate if the client is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Do You Talk Price With Clients?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know, all this pricing strategy sounds really simple- in theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you actually start talking about your logo design pricing with potential clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just the kind of thing we do on a regular basis in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We role play how to have value and pricing discussions, along with overcoming objections, on a regular basis during coaching calls with Chris Do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And for being a friend of The Futur, we’re giving you access to the Sell Without Selling call for free, just for stopping by!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/6078725adc5b313e7ab35f44_logo-design-pricing-video.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;State Your Price Early and Often&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So hopefully we’ve convinced you to either price by outputs or to try out value-based pricing. You pro, you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s our number one logo design pricing tip that’s going to set you up for success and help you quickly weed out the price shoppers and the bargain-basement clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say your price on the phone with clients before you ever show it to them in writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes straight from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.winwithoutpitching.com/pricing-creativity/&#34;&gt;Blair Enn’s book, &lt;em&gt;Pricing Creativity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t want you to spend hours on a fancy proposal only to find that a client can nowhere near afford you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we don’t want you to wait until the second call with a potential client to start talking price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it’s a matter of respect. For not just yourself but for the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re wasting both your time and there’s if you’re not getting down to business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And speaking of business, it shows that you’re a real business person if you aren’t afraid to talk price up front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only amateurs will be put off by the pricing talk and the pros will be impressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get a verbal agreement to your logo design pricing, then (and only then) will you send over a written proposal for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Price Anchoring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not you’re pricing your logo (or any other design work) by outputs or with a value-based model, you want to talk price soon and often, and you want to anchor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price anchor refers to the practice of stating your highest possible rate first, followed by the low end of the price range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, your minimum level of engagement is $5000 for a logo but the price could increase, depending on scope, complexity, and number of revisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to tell your potential client that, depending on the scope, a logo could cost anywhere from $20,000 to $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By stating the higher number first, you’re prepping leads with the maximum budget they’ll need. They’re going to get stuck on that number. Pause a sec and let them absorb that high number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state the lower price. They’re going to think the lower price is a bargain!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll then want to ask if their budget will work with your price range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it does- awesome! You can move directly to price bracketing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if it doesn’t? Don’t worry- we’re covering that in just a sec!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Price Bracketing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know how you go to a lot of software and web applications these days and see various tiers of pricing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s the standard, the deluxe (or most popular), and the all-star level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is price bracketing in action!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price bracketing gives your potential clients something to compare you to- you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who needs to keep looking for other logo designers if you’re already giving them pricing options!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here’s how to bracket your pricing:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write down your core offering. For example, it could be a full identity system: three stylescapes, logo variations (three concepts with three revisions), and a brand style guide including colors and typefaces. Name this core offering and set a price. This will be your mid-level and most popular tier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now to the right, create a package that’s not as involved. Perhaps it’s three stylescapes, one logo concept with three revisions, and a style sheet. Name it and price it at a lower price point (perhaps your minimum level of engagement).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now take your core offering and amp it up! What more could you add? Could you create a suite of social media graphics and train the team on the proper use of the new identity system? Perhaps even provide one-year of support on implementation or monthly collateral reviews with the in-house design team? This will be your white-glove offer, set at a much higher price point. And depending on the client’s needs, this price may change from project to project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need a bit more explanation? Then check out this inside peek at a &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt; Call where Chris Do runs through creating your pricing tiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fVLK9fJoM1g&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When a Client Says Your Logo Design Pricing is Too High&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s bound to happen, especially once you know your minimum level of engagement and treat logo design pricing as a way to build a thriving business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some potential clients will say your price is too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now before we move on to how to handle this objection, know that one our favorite words is no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do not have to take any design job, especially if it’s not going to keep your lights on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying yes to low-paying projects may seem like a short-term solution to bringing in more revenue, but at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each low-paying client you say yes to, you’re saying no to opportunities that could really change the trajectory of your business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And remember, before that low-paying client came knocking on your door, you were still going to figure out a way to pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, before you start immediately saying no, here’s some pro advice from our &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt; member, Rodrigo Tasca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“If they’re not meeting you at your price, you don’t have to meet them at their deliverable.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can still negotiate, as long as your minimum level of engagement is being met. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could go back to your price bracketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you offered a lower tier package that does fit their budget?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or could you ask for a revenue share of the project? Ask for a percentage of new clients’ revenue for a time-period and do the job for free. This is no risk to the client- but after hearing this proposal they might just be thinking twice about rejecting your initial pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to see this kind of negotiating in action?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then check out this role play with Chris Do and &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt;, Mo. This is the kind of work we do in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt; on a regular basis- helping our members sharpen their negotiation skills. This video has to do with video production but could easily be tweaked to work with logo design pricing as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFk8ZmIDrFM&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But What About Getting Paid in Exposure Bucks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s bound to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A potential client won’t have the budget to hire you at your minimum level of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they whip out the exposure-bucks negotiation tactic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ll promise that this project will look so good in your portfolio and they’ll tell all their business buddies about you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s take this one point at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the project will look good in your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes- it might. But you need to remember that you’re in the problem solving business and the work you’re doing is important to the success of this client’s business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should get paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways to look at the “this project will look good in your portfolio,” argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this client is in the supply chain of the industry you’d like to work in, then yes. This project will look good in your portfolio. It will help build expertise. But just remember, just because a client doesn’t meet you at your budget doesn’t mean you need to meet them at their deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this project will help you level-up your portfolio, then negotiate on the deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then there’s the other side of the “this project will look good in your portfolio” argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if this project isn’t going to build your expertise and get you an in in a particular industry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might as well do a passion project or a pro bono project in the industry you want to grow in rather than spend your time working on a project that’s not really going to do anything for your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like it’s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now for part two of the exposure bucks argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project will lead to referrals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should be expecting referrals from your clients anyway. This shouldn’t be something you only get by lowering your price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And think about the business buddies they probably have. Time to move on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Raise Your Logo Design Pricing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you’ve come this far, you may be wondering how to actually raise your rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve realized that you are selling yourself short and not charging enough to either make ends meet or to compensate for the value you’re providing clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like it’s time to raise your logo design pricing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you do it in one step: Start negotiating as if you’re negotiating for someone else that you care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you’re fighting on someone else’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get comfortable saying no if people can’t meet your pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to explain yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be offended by clients with low budgets but also don’t feel guilty about charging what you’re worth and saying no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more you get paid by a client, the more they’re saying thank you. The more they’ll appreciate the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just double your price tomorrow without explanation. No framing- don’t explain. If they don’t like it’s fine. Move on with your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wondering how this is done in action? Watch Chris Do coach an illustrator through the process in this video from The Futur archives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIw-PBNXWgE&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Create More Demand For Your Design Work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand drives price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more in-demand you are, the higher your logo design pricing can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do you create more demand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we move into the not-so-magical formula for creating demand, let’s go over the basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You’ve got to be reliable.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet deadlines, show up to meetings, do what you say you’re going to do every single time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You’ve got to be talented.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on filling your portfolio will quality case studies that shows off what you can really do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You’ve got to be a cool person to work with.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People won’t refer you and you won’t get continued work if you aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you check off all these boxes, you’re ready for the move that will really get you in demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You’ve got to be in a market where there’s a demand for your skill.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So first and foremost- stay off of Fiverr and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s way too much competition for not that much return. You won’t hit your minimum level of engagement with these kinds of clients because anyone looking for that kind of a deal isn’t trying to solve a big problem in their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how can you enter a market that isn’t so full?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to specialize. Become &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;logo designer for a particular industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be bakeries or architects or yoga studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do some research and choose a viable market that you can dominate and your demand will increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logo design pricing doesn’t need to be that complicated but there are a few things to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Just remember to:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine your minimum level of engagement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose your pricing method&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start talking price early and often&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anchor your pricing high&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop pricing brackets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t be afraid to walk away from low-budget projects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on increasing your demand&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;In Our Ultimate Guide to Logo Design Pricing You’ll Learn:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;What pricing to expect if you’re in need of a new logo&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How clients choose who’s the best designer for the job&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determining how much you need to charge&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Three different logo design pricing models&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to anchor and bracket your logo design pricing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What to do when a client says your price is too high&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to handle calls with low-budget clients&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to raise your logo design pricing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to increase demand for your creative services&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not a logo designer and looking for ways to price your other creative services?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then this guide is for you, too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we say logo, just insert whatever you provide: copywriting, UX/UI design, social media marketing- you name it and this guide will help you price it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What to Expect When Paying for a Logo (For the Clients)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re a business owner and stumbled upon this article hoping to find some info on how much a logo will set you back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome- we’re happy you’re here!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing we want you to think about (beyond your budget- we’ll get to that) is why do you need a logo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What business problem are you hoping this new logo will solve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will you measure the success of the logo once it’s implemented?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And speaking of implementation, where is this logo going to go? Will you need additional logo variations, a new color and typeface system, illustrations and patterns, and a brand style guide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you go searching for a logo designer and wondering the price, think about the added value that this logo will bring to your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, look for designers who not only have the portfolio that speaks to your business but also talk with you about the problems the logo will solve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more value the logo and possible new identity system brings to your business, the more you can expect to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designers at Fiverr are not going to worry about solving big business problems. They’re just going to give you a logo that may (or may not) meet your business goals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if your new logo isn’t going to solve a big business problem, is it even worth it to have a new logo designed? Is there any other area in your business that needs more attention? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But let’s say this new identity system is really going to move your business forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps there’s a disconnect between the image you’re achieving and the image you want to portray to attract new customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that’s worth paying attention to!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how much will it cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really depends on the designer- their experience, their level of specialization in a particular style or industry, and their demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It really could be anywhere from $3,000 for a single logo mark to $100,000+ for a new identity system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to look to sites like Behance and Google &amp;#34;brand identity designers&amp;#34; in your particular industry to find the right designer to help you achieve your business goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you end up going with Fiverr, just remember- you get what you pay for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Clients Choose Who Will Design Their Logo&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is it that some designers are able to charge ten and even one hundred times more than others for a logo design?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve got to start thinking about the value that the logo will bring to the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On one end of the client spectrum are large corporations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a lot of risk involved on their end when it comes to implementing the new logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if something goes wrong? Think of all the places that logo could be placed and printed and how much money’s at stake if the rebrand doesn’t go well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While a new logo and brand identity doesn’t necessarily guarantee a positive impact on the company, it can definitely have a negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So corporations are looking for the least risky option. They’re looking for agencies and designers with a track record of success with the type of logo design they need and they will have higher budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually, not charging enough with these companies will make you look risky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now on the other end of the spectrum are the mom and pop shops. Smaller businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logos might only appear on a website and a few other touch points, such as signage and social media- maybe a bit of packaging but they won’t have a large printing budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For these types of businesses, the risk isn’t as high because if the logo design goes wrong, the fix is easier. So the logo isn’t as valuable. Meaning the budget won’t be as high- they’ll be looking for designers with lower logo design pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if you’re pricing with smaller mom and pop shops or large corporations, all clients want to know that you’re the least risky option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want a deep dive with Chris Do on logo design pricing? Then check out this popular video where he discusses how you can start talking business with your design clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because clients want to know you know business and not just logo design if you’re going to command a higher rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RKXZ7t_RiOE&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How can you show that you’re the least risky option?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients will be looking at:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social proof&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Referrals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Case studies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Expertise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Credit history&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Determining Your Minimum Level of Engagement for Logo Design Pricing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve gone over what the client needs, now let’s talk about what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gone are your days of just slapping a price on a logo based on a gut feeling and then lowering it as soon as a potential client says it’s too much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve got bills to pay!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re going to figure out your minimum level of engagement for design projects so you’ll know exactly what you need to bring in with each project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here’s the quick and dirty way to determine your minimum level of engagement:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add up all your overhead for a month- how much does it cost to keep the business up and running?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Add in your own pay- how much will you take home every month? This should cover your personal expenses and then some- ‘cause creatives gotta have some fun!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Account for monthly taxes or they’ll come back to bite you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now add in profit- how much do you want to have left over at the end of the month?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now multiply by 12. That’s how much you need to bring in in one year.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine how many projects you can realistically complete in a year. Divide your yearly revenue goal by the number of projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now you have your minimum level of engagement- you know the lowest amount each project you take on should cost.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#39;s look at three logo design pricing models for you to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Logo Design Pricing Model #1: Inputs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of pricing inputs as your hourly or day rate and then some.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We call it cost plus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because you really should be charging your hourly or day rate, plus your overhead, miscellaneous fees, and adding on room for profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this can get a bit confusing and isn’t something we recommend for logo design pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in this method, we have a video from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt; archives in which Chris Do walks members through how to create an inputs-based bid for a motion graphics project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/OiUOaZJJYzg?start=373&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;But like we said, this isn’t what we recommend for logo design pricing because charging by the hour or by the day often penalizes you for being efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So let’s move on to a logo design pricing model that will be much more effective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Logo Design Pricing Model #2: Outputs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the logo design pricing model that will most likely be the easiest to wrap your head around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You and the client determine the scope of work and you&amp;#39;re paid for those deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is great if you’re efficient- you can get the work done quickly, not have to worry about an hourly rate, and can move on to the next job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pricing by outputs will come back to haunt you if you don’t have a contract in place that specifically states how many logo options and revisions the client will receive, along with other terms and conditions surrounding how long clients have to send in revision requests and if there will be any overages if the project goes off-schedule due to the client not getting back to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do you determine the cost of your outputs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refer back to your minimum level of engagement!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to give the client more pricing options? Then check out the section in this article on price bracketing your logo designs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Logo Design Pricing Model #3: Value-Based&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s just imagine a client scenario for a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say that a local bakery gives you a call looking for a logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’re just getting started and have a limited budget but really want to get this logo right. It’ll go on their website, their signage, and stickers for their minimal packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you give a price of $5000 and they accept. All is right in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the next day an organic food market gives you a call. They have a new line of juices that will need identity design. They’ll need multiple variations for the different juices in the product lineup, which will be rolled out to all their locations nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you give them the same price?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could very well lose the job if you price too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where value-based pricing comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Value-based logo design pricing means you price the client and not the project.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You start considering the value that this design project will bring to the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means you’re going to need to have a conversation with your potential clients about their desired future state and how this logo fits into their business goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll need to start asking questions such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Why are you giving us a call?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Why do you think you need a new logo?” Start writing down their problems&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“Anything else?” Keep drilling it down so they uncover all the problems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“How will we measure that these goals are being met?” You want to determine their success metrics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“How much increased revenue are you hoping this initiative will bring to the company?” Get it down to a number.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“What percentage of this number are you thinking to invest?”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is where you and the client can start having a conversation around whether or not that percentage is disproportionate to the amount of value the logo (or any other creative service) will provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if a client says their identity design isn’t connecting with their target audience and they’re hoping to grow their revenue by $500,000 in the next year and they only want to spend $1000 on a new identity design, that’s only 0.2%! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems a bit disproportionate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This opens up the conversation to negotiate if the client is reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Do You Talk Price With Clients?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We know, all this pricing strategy sounds really simple- in theory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how do you actually start talking about your logo design pricing with potential clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just the kind of thing we do on a regular basis in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We role play how to have value and pricing discussions, along with overcoming objections, on a regular basis during coaching calls with Chris Do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And for being a friend of The Futur, we’re giving you access to the Sell Without Selling call for free, just for stopping by!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;‍&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/6078725adc5b313e7ab35f44_logo-design-pricing-video.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;State Your Price Early and Often&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So hopefully we’ve convinced you to either price by outputs or to try out value-based pricing. You pro, you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here’s our number one logo design pricing tip that’s going to set you up for success and help you quickly weed out the price shoppers and the bargain-basement clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say your price on the phone with clients before you ever show it to them in writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This comes straight from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.winwithoutpitching.com/pricing-creativity/&#34;&gt;Blair Enn’s book, &lt;em&gt;Pricing Creativity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t want you to spend hours on a fancy proposal only to find that a client can nowhere near afford you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we don’t want you to wait until the second call with a potential client to start talking price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, it’s a matter of respect. For not just yourself but for the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re wasting both your time and there’s if you’re not getting down to business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And speaking of business, it shows that you’re a real business person if you aren’t afraid to talk price up front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only amateurs will be put off by the pricing talk and the pros will be impressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you get a verbal agreement to your logo design pricing, then (and only then) will you send over a written proposal for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Price Anchoring&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of whether or not you’re pricing your logo (or any other design work) by outputs or with a value-based model, you want to talk price soon and often, and you want to anchor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price anchor refers to the practice of stating your highest possible rate first, followed by the low end of the price range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, your minimum level of engagement is $5000 for a logo but the price could increase, depending on scope, complexity, and number of revisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to tell your potential client that, depending on the scope, a logo could cost anywhere from $20,000 to $5,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By stating the higher number first, you’re prepping leads with the maximum budget they’ll need. They’re going to get stuck on that number. Pause a sec and let them absorb that high number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state the lower price. They’re going to think the lower price is a bargain!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll then want to ask if their budget will work with your price range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it does- awesome! You can move directly to price bracketing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if it doesn’t? Don’t worry- we’re covering that in just a sec!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Price Bracketing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You know how you go to a lot of software and web applications these days and see various tiers of pricing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s the standard, the deluxe (or most popular), and the all-star level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is price bracketing in action!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price bracketing gives your potential clients something to compare you to- you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who needs to keep looking for other logo designers if you’re already giving them pricing options!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here’s how to bracket your pricing:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write down your core offering. For example, it could be a full identity system: three stylescapes, logo variations (three concepts with three revisions), and a brand style guide including colors and typefaces. Name this core offering and set a price. This will be your mid-level and most popular tier.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now to the right, create a package that’s not as involved. Perhaps it’s three stylescapes, one logo concept with three revisions, and a style sheet. Name it and price it at a lower price point (perhaps your minimum level of engagement).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now take your core offering and amp it up! What more could you add? Could you create a suite of social media graphics and train the team on the proper use of the new identity system? Perhaps even provide one-year of support on implementation or monthly collateral reviews with the in-house design team? This will be your white-glove offer, set at a much higher price point. And depending on the client’s needs, this price may change from project to project.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need a bit more explanation? Then check out this inside peek at a &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt; Call where Chris Do runs through creating your pricing tiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/fVLK9fJoM1g&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;When a Client Says Your Logo Design Pricing is Too High&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s bound to happen, especially once you know your minimum level of engagement and treat logo design pricing as a way to build a thriving business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some potential clients will say your price is too high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now before we move on to how to handle this objection, know that one our favorite words is no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You do not have to take any design job, especially if it’s not going to keep your lights on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saying yes to low-paying projects may seem like a short-term solution to bringing in more revenue, but at what cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each low-paying client you say yes to, you’re saying no to opportunities that could really change the trajectory of your business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And remember, before that low-paying client came knocking on your door, you were still going to figure out a way to pay the bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, before you start immediately saying no, here’s some pro advice from our &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt; member, Rodrigo Tasca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“If they’re not meeting you at your price, you don’t have to meet them at their deliverable.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can still negotiate, as long as your minimum level of engagement is being met. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could go back to your price bracketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you offered a lower tier package that does fit their budget?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or could you ask for a revenue share of the project? Ask for a percentage of new clients’ revenue for a time-period and do the job for free. This is no risk to the client- but after hearing this proposal they might just be thinking twice about rejecting your initial pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to see this kind of negotiating in action?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then check out this role play with Chris Do and &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt;, Mo. This is the kind of work we do in the &lt;a href=&#34;http://thefutur.com/pro-group&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Group&lt;/a&gt; on a regular basis- helping our members sharpen their negotiation skills. This video has to do with video production but could easily be tweaked to work with logo design pricing as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFk8ZmIDrFM&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But What About Getting Paid in Exposure Bucks?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s bound to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A potential client won’t have the budget to hire you at your minimum level of engagement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So they whip out the exposure-bucks negotiation tactic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They’ll promise that this project will look so good in your portfolio and they’ll tell all their business buddies about you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, let’s take this one point at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the project will look good in your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes- it might. But you need to remember that you’re in the problem solving business and the work you’re doing is important to the success of this client’s business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should get paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of ways to look at the “this project will look good in your portfolio,” argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this client is in the supply chain of the industry you’d like to work in, then yes. This project will look good in your portfolio. It will help build expertise. But just remember, just because a client doesn’t meet you at your budget doesn’t mean you need to meet them at their deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If this project will help you level-up your portfolio, then negotiate on the deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But then there’s the other side of the “this project will look good in your portfolio” argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if this project isn’t going to build your expertise and get you an in in a particular industry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You might as well do a passion project or a pro bono project in the industry you want to grow in rather than spend your time working on a project that’s not really going to do anything for your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like it’s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so now for part two of the exposure bucks argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project will lead to referrals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should be expecting referrals from your clients anyway. This shouldn’t be something you only get by lowering your price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And think about the business buddies they probably have. Time to move on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Raise Your Logo Design Pricing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you’ve come this far, you may be wondering how to actually raise your rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve realized that you are selling yourself short and not charging enough to either make ends meet or to compensate for the value you’re providing clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounds like it’s time to raise your logo design pricing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how you do it in one step: Start negotiating as if you’re negotiating for someone else that you care about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you’re fighting on someone else’s behalf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get comfortable saying no if people can’t meet your pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to explain yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be offended by clients with low budgets but also don’t feel guilty about charging what you’re worth and saying no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more you get paid by a client, the more they’re saying thank you. The more they’ll appreciate the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just double your price tomorrow without explanation. No framing- don’t explain. If they don’t like it’s fine. Move on with your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wondering how this is done in action? Watch Chris Do coach an illustrator through the process in this video from The Futur archives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIw-PBNXWgE&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Create More Demand For Your Design Work&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand drives price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more in-demand you are, the higher your logo design pricing can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do you create more demand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before we move into the not-so-magical formula for creating demand, let’s go over the basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You’ve got to be reliable.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet deadlines, show up to meetings, do what you say you’re going to do every single time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You’ve got to be talented.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work on filling your portfolio will quality case studies that shows off what you can really do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You’ve got to be a cool person to work with.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;People won’t refer you and you won’t get continued work if you aren’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, if you check off all these boxes, you’re ready for the move that will really get you in demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;You’ve got to be in a market where there’s a demand for your skill.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;So first and foremost- stay off of Fiverr and the like.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s way too much competition for not that much return. You won’t hit your minimum level of engagement with these kinds of clients because anyone looking for that kind of a deal isn’t trying to solve a big problem in their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how can you enter a market that isn’t so full?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to specialize. Become &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;logo designer for a particular industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could be bakeries or architects or yoga studios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do some research and choose a viable market that you can dominate and your demand will increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logo design pricing doesn’t need to be that complicated but there are a few things to consider. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Just remember to:&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Determine your minimum level of engagement&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose your pricing method&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Start talking price early and often&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anchor your pricing high&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop pricing brackets&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Don’t be afraid to walk away from low-budget projects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on increasing your demand&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Happy Thanksgiving!</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, we&amp;#39;ve seen the devastating impacts of the coronavirus. At best, we have had to change the way we work and play, becoming uncomfortably close with loneliness. Many of us have lost clients and jobs... or at worst, even lost friends and family. Amid the fear, we found it hard to feel peace, joy, and hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here in the US, we have fought injustice and inequality: a painful, messy, necessary transformation. The rift we&amp;#39;ve exposed with our neighbors, friends, and loved ones is a fresh wound. Each time healing begins, something comes along and rips it open again. Amid the anger, it has been hard to be kind, gracious, and empathetic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year has seen enough to overwhelm anyone: economic turmoil, raging wildfires, terrible hurricanes, global leadership crisis, and civil unrest. Amid the chaos, finding something to be thankful for can be hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you know what? Doing the right thing is usually hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My life has repeatedly reinforced this lesson: Difficulty always precedes greatness, but greatness never follows a difficulty abandoned. We are responsible to persevere through the obstacles life puts in front of us; To do the hard thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be hard to feel hopeful, but without hope, we are hopeless. It can be hard to be kind, but without kindness, it is impossible to heal together. It can be hard to give thanks, but celebrating the present and experiencing joy become much harder without gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One common Thanksgiving tradition is to take turns around the dinner table, sharing what we are thankful for. The younger me scoffed at this cliche exercise and its seemingly disingenuous answers. With age, however, my perspective has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are all thankful for our family and friends. We are all thankful for the food we eat. We are all thankful for the air we breathe. But how often do we say these things? How often do we recognize what we are genuinely and sincerely grateful for? How often do we practice gratitude?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practicing gratitude yields so many incredible benefits: blocking negative emotions, reducing depression, creating more meaningful relationships, and magnifying happiness &lt;a href=&#34;https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-appreciation/&#34;&gt;are just a few&lt;/a&gt;. Gratitude, it seems, could be the therapy many of us need this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s within our reach, but we must take action. This Thanksgiving, I invite you to share what you are grateful for. Share it in person, over the phone, on social media, or say it out loud. No hashtag, no contrived marketing effort: The five minutes you spend may spark the change you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow me to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m grateful for my wife, Elise. She is my backbone, my heart, and my why. I&amp;#39;m grateful for my kids, Willow and Olivia. They are not only joyful: they &lt;em&gt;are joy&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;m grateful for my mentor, Chris. He inspires me to improve continuously, to reach for greatness in everything I do. I&amp;#39;m grateful for our team here at The Futur. Nothing is impossible for them, and I&amp;#39;m honored to have them by my side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m grateful for you. Yep, that&amp;#39;s right: you. Because of you, we&amp;#39;re able to try new things. We&amp;#39;re able to fail. We&amp;#39;re able to build an incredible community together. Every video you watch, every comment you leave, every purchase you make, every story you share may seem insignificant, but rest assured: it means the world to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s so much more I could write, but it&amp;#39;s your turn. Please don&amp;#39;t forget to practice gratitude today. From all of us here at The Futur, we hope you have a warm, happy Thanksgiving and a healthy, joyful holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find hope. Be kind. Give thanks. Even if it&amp;#39;s hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Ben Burns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;I asked the rest of our team at The Futur what they were thankful for. Here is what they wrote:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m super grateful for my husband and 2 daughters. Even after all the horrible events, ugliness that is being expressed by people, sadness that is surrounding us all, they keep me happy and at peace. I&amp;#39;m glad we are all safe and healthy. I&amp;#39;m also grateful for the friends I have. No matter the amount of time that goes by, I can pick up the phone and have a fantastic conversation, just like when we were in high school. Even though my in-person bubble is small, my distanced bubble is huge and I&amp;#39;m truly thankful. I&amp;#39;m thankful for being able to work through this pandemic. This bit of normalcy keeps me sane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Monica Martin, Head of HR and Bookkeeping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for my family, friends and co-workers, who have been vital in keeping me sane this year. I’m grateful for the roof over my head, good movies, good books, and the internet that has helped keep me in contact with people, even as we are stuck inside. I’m grateful for the community that is The Futur. To be able to interact with people all around the world, even in a time as precarious as this, and to know that what we do is helping people. I’m grateful for cat videos on Instagram, and last, but certainly not least, I am grateful for pizza. I feel that needs no further explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Stewart Schuster, Video Producer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for both tears and smiles in my life. Whatever happens, it makes me feel alive. My son&amp;#39;s laughter wakes me up each morning. He waves at me before running down the stairs, after stealing my phone so he can dance to some song on Soundcloud. He&amp;#39;s almost 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am thankful for my relationship with my father. It&amp;#39;s been a bumpy road these past 17 years, but we brought it back. I also keep my brother and sister close to my heart. We are all different, but at our core, we are very much alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My godfather and godmother are precious to me. They support me, no questions asked. My friends, they accept me. And that is what one needs sometimes. Just being accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a small team here at The Futur. That&amp;#39;s what makes this special. I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot and still am. I couldn&amp;#39;t ask for better people to work with and learn from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I cherish you, mother. I can only imagine how you would be around my son.&lt;br/&gt;Smiles and tears, it&amp;#39;s all about feeling alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Alex Burlui, Marketing Coordinator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, internet stranger. Greg Gunn here. We’re supposed to write what we’re grateful for in this mighty blog post. But I’m not going to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I am grateful. For all the wonderful people and opportunities in my life. My health and my anxious sense of sanity. Especially during this miserable turd of a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I want to say, to you reading this right now, is thank you and that I’m proud of you. The thank you is for your support of The Futur. Spiritually, financially, or otherwise. Without you, kind stranger, we would be nothing but a bunch of lonely dummies talking amongst ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I’m proud of you because if you’re reading this, it means you’re taking steps to better yourself. Or your business. Or you just like to read lengthy design blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case may be, good for you. And I hope you’re able to take a moment to appreciate that fact. Maybe even give yourself a hug while you’re at it. Be well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Greg Gunn, Creative Director&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this finds you well. I wasn’t sure what to write about and if I should be serious or funny. I’ll leave the serious with the more serious people. I’m thankful for routine, I’m thankful for self-care, I’m thankful for work, I’m thankful for weights, I’m thankful for all the little beautiful things in life that pass me by every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you find some things today to be thankful for, and to not just use today to be thankful, but to use more days to be thankful. I appreciate you and hope you have a thankful life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Ricky Lucas, Cinematographer &amp;amp; Editor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Thanksgiving feels more needed than ever. The need to appreciate what we have, rather than what we&amp;#39;ve had to give up. And to appreciate our loved ones, even if we haven&amp;#39;t felt their hugs for far too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so thankful for my family and friends for always finding ways to feel connected, no matter how far apart we are. And for my partner, Dewi, for continuously pushing me to shoot for the moon, even when I don&amp;#39;t believe in myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thankful for you, Futur fam. Every Instagram like, comment, anecdote and message of gratitude makes me so proud to be able to share the wisdom and teachings of our Futur team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hear you, and I&amp;#39;m with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only am I thankful for The Futur, I&amp;#39;m honored to work for a company that rises to every occasion and strives to be better than we were before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Elle Money, Social Media Marketer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am thankful for here and now. For you and I. For this world we share. Another day. Another opportunity. Another chance to write a new page in life. I&amp;#39;m thankful that you are all part of my story, and I&amp;#39;m thankful to be part of yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Matthew Encina, Chief Content Officer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful for the people in my life. My wife, who literally saves kids’ lives, my family who I love AF, and my loyal friends who are there, through thick and thin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My coworkers at The Futur have become a second family to me, especially during this pandemic. I’m thankful for having this opportunity to work with a super cool, super smart team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m thankful to work with this awesome community. I’ve met many of you from across the world in Spain, Italy, Poland, UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Canada and beyond. It becomes so real when we meet in person, and to be greeted like we’ve been friends forever. When I just started working at The Futur, I didn’t expect what we were doing would connect me to so many great people. Thank you. YOU are the reason!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Mark Contreras, Producer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey y’all, I’m grateful to be doing what I like in a place I love with people I admire. For all the things I’ve learned from working here because otherwise I wouldn’t have made it through this pandemic without adopting the mindset tip from Errol Gerson. “If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my generous second family here at The Futur, for looking out for little ol’ me and always lending a hand when I need it. I’m thankful for my work hubby Ricky for being like a bigger brother to me and for sharing his delicious cooking recipes with me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful to still be able to connect with family, cousins, and friends because they makes me feel at home without physically being there. I’m ETERNALLY grateful for my parents for bringing me sweet Houston comfort food when they visited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly I’m grateful y’all appreciate the livestreams because y’all have no idea how much chaos goes into it. Thank y’all for doing everything that you because this wouldn’t be possible without y’all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Jona Garcia, Cinematographer &amp;amp; Editor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest: the start of this year kicked my butt down the street and back. I felt really low lows. I cried a lot. I wanted to rid the world of the doom and gloom we were all feeling. Gratitude was never on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, though, I’m reminded of all the positives, and I’m feeling pretty darn grateful. For my family and friends, who I’d be nothing without. Their love and support keeps me going, and every second with them is a blessing. For my fiancé, who always pushes me to be a better version of myself and makes me laugh uncontrollably. For my cats, Jake and Lucy, who give the best snuggles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m grateful for the friends I’ve made here at The Futur, who have taught me so much, it kind of blows my mind the amount I’ve learned from them. (Seriously, thank you, you guys.) And for you, our Futur fam, for your never-ending support, encouragement and positivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m thankful for good food (mainly soup and rice &amp;amp; beans), and the greatest album released this year: &lt;em&gt;Positions&lt;/em&gt; by Ariana Grande.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though we’ve been tested over and over again this year, I hope today we remember all the good that’s right in front of us, the good we can give to each other no matter the distance, and the good we can bring into the new year. Big virtual hugs to you all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Nathalia Iole, Copywriter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

The younger me scoffed at this cliche exercise and its seemingly disingenuous answers. With age, however, my perspective has changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are all thankful for our family and friends. We are all thankful for the food we eat. We are all thankful for the air we breathe. But how often do we say these things? How often do we recognize what we are genuinely and sincerely grateful for? How often do we practice gratitude?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Practicing gratitude yields so many incredible benefits: blocking negative emotions, reducing depression, creating more meaningful relationships, and magnifying happiness &lt;a href=&#34;https://positivepsychology.com/gratitude-appreciation/&#34;&gt;are just a few&lt;/a&gt;. Gratitude, it seems, could be the therapy many of us need this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s within our reach, but we must take action. This Thanksgiving, I invite you to share what you are grateful for. Share it in person, over the phone, on social media, or say it out loud. No hashtag, no contrived marketing effort: The five minutes you spend may spark the change you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allow me to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m grateful for my wife, Elise. She is my backbone, my heart, and my why. I&amp;#39;m grateful for my kids, Willow and Olivia. They are not only joyful: they &lt;em&gt;are joy&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;m grateful for my mentor, Chris. He inspires me to improve continuously, to reach for greatness in everything I do. I&amp;#39;m grateful for our team here at The Futur. Nothing is impossible for them, and I&amp;#39;m honored to have them by my side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m grateful for you. Yep, that&amp;#39;s right: you. Because of you, we&amp;#39;re able to try new things. We&amp;#39;re able to fail. We&amp;#39;re able to build an incredible community together. Every video you watch, every comment you leave, every purchase you make, every story you share may seem insignificant, but rest assured: it means the world to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s so much more I could write, but it&amp;#39;s your turn. Please don&amp;#39;t forget to practice gratitude today. From all of us here at The Futur, we hope you have a warm, happy Thanksgiving and a healthy, joyful holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find hope. Be kind. Give thanks. Even if it&amp;#39;s hard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;—Ben Burns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;I asked the rest of our team at The Futur what they were thankful for. Here is what they wrote:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m super grateful for my husband and 2 daughters. Even after all the horrible events, ugliness that is being expressed by people, sadness that is surrounding us all, they keep me happy and at peace. I&amp;#39;m glad we are all safe and healthy. I&amp;#39;m also grateful for the friends I have. No matter the amount of time that goes by, I can pick up the phone and have a fantastic conversation, just like when we were in high school. Even though my in-person bubble is small, my distanced bubble is huge and I&amp;#39;m truly thankful. I&amp;#39;m thankful for being able to work through this pandemic. This bit of normalcy keeps me sane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Monica Martin, Head of HR and Bookkeeping&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for my family, friends and co-workers, who have been vital in keeping me sane this year. I’m grateful for the roof over my head, good movies, good books, and the internet that has helped keep me in contact with people, even as we are stuck inside. I’m grateful for the community that is The Futur. To be able to interact with people all around the world, even in a time as precarious as this, and to know that what we do is helping people. I’m grateful for cat videos on Instagram, and last, but certainly not least, I am grateful for pizza. I feel that needs no further explanation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Stewart Schuster, Video Producer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am grateful for both tears and smiles in my life. Whatever happens, it makes me feel alive. My son&amp;#39;s laughter wakes me up each morning. He waves at me before running down the stairs, after stealing my phone so he can dance to some song on Soundcloud. He&amp;#39;s almost 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am thankful for my relationship with my father. It&amp;#39;s been a bumpy road these past 17 years, but we brought it back. I also keep my brother and sister close to my heart. We are all different, but at our core, we are very much alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My godfather and godmother are precious to me. They support me, no questions asked. My friends, they accept me. And that is what one needs sometimes. Just being accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are a small team here at The Futur. That&amp;#39;s what makes this special. I&amp;#39;ve learned a lot and still am. I couldn&amp;#39;t ask for better people to work with and learn from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I cherish you, mother. I can only imagine how you would be around my son.&lt;br/&gt;Smiles and tears, it&amp;#39;s all about feeling alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Alex Burlui, Marketing Coordinator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, internet stranger. Greg Gunn here. We’re supposed to write what we’re grateful for in this mighty blog post. But I’m not going to do that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I am grateful. For all the wonderful people and opportunities in my life. My health and my anxious sense of sanity. Especially during this miserable turd of a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All I want to say, to you reading this right now, is thank you and that I’m proud of you. The thank you is for your support of The Futur. Spiritually, financially, or otherwise. Without you, kind stranger, we would be nothing but a bunch of lonely dummies talking amongst ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And I’m proud of you because if you’re reading this, it means you’re taking steps to better yourself. Or your business. Or you just like to read lengthy design blogs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case may be, good for you. And I hope you’re able to take a moment to appreciate that fact. Maybe even give yourself a hug while you’re at it. Be well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Greg Gunn, Creative Director&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this finds you well. I wasn’t sure what to write about and if I should be serious or funny. I’ll leave the serious with the more serious people. I’m thankful for routine, I’m thankful for self-care, I’m thankful for work, I’m thankful for weights, I’m thankful for all the little beautiful things in life that pass me by every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you find some things today to be thankful for, and to not just use today to be thankful, but to use more days to be thankful. I appreciate you and hope you have a thankful life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Ricky Lucas, Cinematographer &amp;amp; Editor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Thanksgiving feels more needed than ever. The need to appreciate what we have, rather than what we&amp;#39;ve had to give up. And to appreciate our loved ones, even if we haven&amp;#39;t felt their hugs for far too long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so thankful for my family and friends for always finding ways to feel connected, no matter how far apart we are. And for my partner, Dewi, for continuously pushing me to shoot for the moon, even when I don&amp;#39;t believe in myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thankful for you, Futur fam. Every Instagram like, comment, anecdote and message of gratitude makes me so proud to be able to share the wisdom and teachings of our Futur team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hear you, and I&amp;#39;m with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only am I thankful for The Futur, I&amp;#39;m honored to work for a company that rises to every occasion and strives to be better than we were before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Elle Money, Social Media Marketer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am thankful for here and now. For you and I. For this world we share. Another day. Another opportunity. Another chance to write a new page in life. I&amp;#39;m thankful that you are all part of my story, and I&amp;#39;m thankful to be part of yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Matthew Encina, Chief Content Officer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful for the people in my life. My wife, who literally saves kids’ lives, my family who I love AF, and my loyal friends who are there, through thick and thin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My coworkers at The Futur have become a second family to me, especially during this pandemic. I’m thankful for having this opportunity to work with a super cool, super smart team. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m thankful to work with this awesome community. I’ve met many of you from across the world in Spain, Italy, Poland, UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Austria, Canada and beyond. It becomes so real when we meet in person, and to be greeted like we’ve been friends forever. When I just started working at The Futur, I didn’t expect what we were doing would connect me to so many great people. Thank you. YOU are the reason!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Mark Contreras, Producer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey y’all, I’m grateful to be doing what I like in a place I love with people I admire. For all the things I’ve learned from working here because otherwise I wouldn’t have made it through this pandemic without adopting the mindset tip from Errol Gerson. “If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my generous second family here at The Futur, for looking out for little ol’ me and always lending a hand when I need it. I’m thankful for my work hubby Ricky for being like a bigger brother to me and for sharing his delicious cooking recipes with me. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m grateful to still be able to connect with family, cousins, and friends because they makes me feel at home without physically being there. I’m ETERNALLY grateful for my parents for bringing me sweet Houston comfort food when they visited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lastly I’m grateful y’all appreciate the livestreams because y’all have no idea how much chaos goes into it. Thank y’all for doing everything that you because this wouldn’t be possible without y’all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Jona Garcia, Cinematographer &amp;amp; Editor&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll be honest: the start of this year kicked my butt down the street and back. I felt really low lows. I cried a lot. I wanted to rid the world of the doom and gloom we were all feeling. Gratitude was never on my mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, though, I’m reminded of all the positives, and I’m feeling pretty darn grateful. For my family and friends, who I’d be nothing without. Their love and support keeps me going, and every second with them is a blessing. For my fiancé, who always pushes me to be a better version of myself and makes me laugh uncontrollably. For my cats, Jake and Lucy, who give the best snuggles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m grateful for the friends I’ve made here at The Futur, who have taught me so much, it kind of blows my mind the amount I’ve learned from them. (Seriously, thank you, you guys.) And for you, our Futur fam, for your never-ending support, encouragement and positivity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m thankful for good food (mainly soup and rice &amp;amp; beans), and the greatest album released this year: &lt;em&gt;Positions&lt;/em&gt; by Ariana Grande.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though we’ve been tested over and over again this year, I hope today we remember all the good that’s right in front of us, the good we can give to each other no matter the distance, and the good we can bring into the new year. Big virtual hugs to you all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— Nathalia Iole, Copywriter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Is Your Website Accessible? 14 Steps to Move Towards Inclusion</title>
    <updated>2020-10-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2020-10-20:/blog/is-your-website-accessible-14-steps-towards-inclusion</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the web was first created, it was meant to provide equal access to information and remove barriers to communication for everyone. Yet today, it’s far from fully accessible for over a billion people with disabilities (about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health&#34;&gt;15% of the world’s population&lt;/a&gt;). And with global aging and medical advancements extending the lives of those with disease or injuries, this gap will only get bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what can you do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start by Recognizing the Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-access-profiles#:~:text=To%20use%20the%20Web%2C%20people%20with%20disabilities%20affecting%20the%20hands,to%20access%20and%20interact%20with&#34;&gt;most common impairments&lt;/a&gt; that can affect the way people use the web include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visual&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hearing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neurological&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, there are special assistive technologies that help them navigate the web. For example, blind people often use screen readers: technology that converts display text into synthesized speech or refreshable Braille. People with motor disabilities can use puff-and-sip systems—tools that work similarly to a joystick, but controlled with breath. They recognize sips or puffs and translate them into mouse clicks or keyboard characters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Web access’ is an umbrella term encompassing “websites, tools, and technologies that are designed and developed so people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web and contribute to it.” Still, web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;On mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens or different input modes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with temporary disabilities such as a broken arm or lost glasses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with situational limitations—those in bright sunlight or in an environment where audio is not allowed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People on a slow, limited, or even expensive bandwidth connection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Address Accessibility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In making the Internet a place of equal opportunities, there are many practical benefits to making your website accessible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Accessibility enhances the brand voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now more than ever, it’s important to take a stance on inclusion. Having an accessible website tells the world that you are attentive to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; customers and honor best practices. This makes it more appealing for clients to support and recommend you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Accessibility expands market outreach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those with disabilities are part of an overlooked market, yet it’s not a niche one. Design that excludes a segment of consumers will fail to reach its full market potential. People with disabilities are often underserved and/or misunderstood by businesses. But with the help of accessibility features, many of them could very well become loyal users or customers. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Accessibility minimizes legal risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many countries, such as the USA, EU, UK, Israel, and Japan, it’s a legal requirement not to discriminate against people due to their disability. In fact, accessibility lawsuits are on the rise. In 2017, the number of such lawsuits filed in US federal courts totaled about 800 cases. Just two years later, the number of cases nearly tripled to over 2,200.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Accessibility spurs innovation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessibility in products and services often solves unanticipated problems for average users and improves usability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case:&lt;/strong&gt; In the early evolution of the iPhone, Apple began considering the implications that a touchscreen device would be helpful for their blind customers. Iterating over several years behind the scenes, the company invested its resources to develop the predecessor of VoiceOver, the world’s first gesture-based screen reader. With it, users could interact with objects on the screen and intuitively gauge their location and context from audio cues. Within weeks of the launch, Apple received a special commendation from the National Federation of the Blind ‘for designing the first fully accessible touchscreen interface.’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checklist: 14 Steps to Make Your Website Accessible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Tim Berners-Lee—better known as the father of the Internet—put an emphasis on web accessibility in the early 90s, and it’s still evolving to this day. In 1999, the W3 Consortium released its first set of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/&#34;&gt;Web Accessibility Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which has been updated several times since then. Based on these guidelines, we’ve put together a general checklist to make sure your website is accessible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Enable alt tags for images&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alt tags don’t just improve search ratings. They’re also accommodating to visually-impaired visitors using a screen reader with their browser. If your webpage has decorative images that don’t add information to the content, add an empty alt text field (alt=&amp;#34;&amp;#34;) so that assistive technologies ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Don’t use autoplay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoplay content can be both irritating and a real barrier to access for people with disabilities. Videos, sounds, and animations that automatically start can be distressing for users with cognitive impairments, impacting their ability to concentrate. Autoplay may also make a website completely inaccessible for people using screen-reading software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Enable controls for multimedia files&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessible media players provide a user interface that works without a mouse through a speech interface when the page is zoomed larger, and with screen readers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Provide captions for multimedia files&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Text versions of speech, like subtitles, along with other important audio content allow different media to be accessible to people with a hearing impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Follow a strict outline hierarchy with headlines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headings are much more than big bold titles. They provide a solid structure to the webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From an accessibility viewpoint, the structure in the code should align with the visual presentation and make sense as a “table of contents” for the page. Make sure your heading levels follow a document outline so screen readers can identify headings and read out the content. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, an &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt; tag would designate a subsection within an &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt; section—meaning you should never come across an &amp;lt;h3&amp;gt; that isn’t preceded by an &amp;lt;h2&amp;gt;.&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h2&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/h3&amp;gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Don’t use images for text&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If visually-impaired visitors can opt to scale up images, they become blurry and pixelated (vector images won’t lose quality when scaled up). Text must display properly when enlarged, so keep that in mind when choosing fonts and devising the composition and layout.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts’ &lt;a href=&#34;https://visibility-design.dk/&#34;&gt;Centre for Visibility Design&lt;/a&gt; has some enlightening and engrossing research on text legibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Allow zoom without affecting the layout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users with impaired vision may prefer to enlarge their browser text or zoom into page content to make it easier to read. Browsers accomplish this in one of two ways: enlarging the font size only, or zooming into the entire page and applying responsive styles, as appropriate. The code should not interfere with the browser’s default settings of enlarging content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Ensure high contrast between objects and the background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some colors and color pairs may confuse visitors with color blindness. (See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/&#34;&gt;contrast checker&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://webaim.org/&#34;&gt;Webaim.org&lt;/a&gt;—it’s an invaluable tool for measuring legibility.) Don’t hesitate to add the Lightbox feature to images—an overlay effect that highlights images by filling the screen and dimming out the rest of the page. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Make sure color is not used as a prompt or a way to convey information &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people with low vision, color perception deficiencies, or color blindness, they struggle to navigate their way through color-drenched content. Make sure that color is not the only prompt used to convey information (e.g. avoid instructions like “select the red circle to continue”). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10. Avoid rapidly flashing animations and video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flickering lights may trigger seizures in users with epilepsy. To avoid this risk, make sure web content that flashes or blinks moves at a slow rate. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://webaccessibility.com/best_practices.php?best_practice_id=1761&#34;&gt;defined threshold&lt;/a&gt; is no more than three flashes in one second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Provide names for all fields in forms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accessible forms are easy to understand, complete, and submit. Instructions, cues, required form fields, and field formatting requirements must be clearly identified to users. Error recovery should be intuitive and descriptive.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12. Include descriptive titles for links &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make sure the titles of your internal pages are brief and descriptive. This helps people using screen readers know what page they’re on as soon as they land there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Ensure all links to documents feature the document type and size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you link to a document, make sure that you state what type of document it is (DOC or PDF) and the file size. This will be helpful for people with slow connection or with limited bandwidth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. Design a cohesive and easy navigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensure that the website can be navigated using a keyboard (check that the website can be navigated through using “Tab,” “Shift+Tab,” and “Enter” keys). Look at pages in a text only browser to confirm that the site makes sense and appears correctly. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who don’t have the hand dexterity to use a mouse may be using arrow keys or assistive technology (for example, voice-controlled navigation). Check that the reading and navigation order in your project is clear and intuitive. Remove any function that uses timed keystrokes, like a double tap, to make sure all parts of the website can be accessed without a mouse and/or a touchpad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create Your Accessible Website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web accessibility is a constantly developing and ever-evolving subject, with this checklist, you have some basic solutions you can reference to fine-tune your website. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, understand the issues others are facing and practice empathy as best you can as you design and develop your website.

    <title>Is Your Website Accessible? 14 Steps to Move Towards Inclusion</title>
    <updated>2020-10-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2020-10-20:/blog/is-your-website-accessible-14-steps-towards-inclusion</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the web was first created, it was meant to provide equal access to information and remove barriers to communication for everyone. Yet today, it’s far from fully accessible for over a billion people with disabilities (about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/disability-and-health&#34;&gt;15% of the world’s population&lt;/a&gt;). And with global aging and medical advancements extending the lives of those with disease or injuries, this gap will only get bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what can you do?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start by Recognizing the Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.w3.org/WAI/EO/Drafts/WAI-access-profiles#:~:text=To%20use%20the%20Web%2C%20people%20with%20disabilities%20affecting%20the%20hands,to%20access%20and%20interact%20with&#34;&gt;most common impairments&lt;/a&gt; that can affect the way people use the web include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visual&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Hearing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Neurological&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Physical &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mental &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, there are special assistive technologies that help them navigate the web. For example, blind people often use screen readers: technology that converts display text into synthesized speech or refreshable Braille. People with motor disabilities can use puff-and-sip systems—tools that work similarly to a joystick, but controlled with breath. They recognize sips or puffs and translate them into mouse clicks or keyboard characters. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Web access’ is an umbrella term encompassing “websites, tools, and technologies that are designed and developed so people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the web and contribute to it.” Still, web accessibility also benefits people without disabilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;On mobile phones, smart watches, smart TVs, and other devices with small screens or different input modes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with temporary disabilities such as a broken arm or lost glasses.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People with situational limitations—those in bright sunlight or in an environment where audio is not allowed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;People on a slow, limited, or even expensive bandwidth connection.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Address Accessibility?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In making the Internet a place of equal opportunities, there are many practical benefits to making your website accessible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Accessibility enhances the brand voice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now more than ever, it’s important to take a stance on inclusion.

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do you stand out from the pack and get noticed? How do you help your clients’ businesses do the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With a compelling brand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A brand establishes the “why” behind a company. It’s their reason for being, and distinguishes one company from another. A standout brand is an important asset to any business looking to rise above the noise in a crowded market—including yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a graphic designer, brand practitioner or marketer servicing clients, we’re going to cover why creative businesses like yours need to incorporate a solid brand-building process for you and your clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever wanted to separate yourself as a designer and learn the strategy that goes into building a compelling brand, or refine your own, you’re in the right place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But before we dive in…&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’d like you to meet Fabian Geyrhalter. You may have seen him pop up on our YouTube channel talking about—&lt;em&gt;surprise surprise&lt;/em&gt;—branding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabian has been running successful brand strategy &amp;amp; design consultancies for almost two decades, working with globally-recognized clients like Acura, Tinder, MGM, MTV, and Sony. He’s won a number of awards for his work in the design and branding spaces, such as American Graphic Design Awards, Communicator Awards, W3 Awards, Davey Awards, and many, many more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past 9 years, Fabian himself has been working exclusively as a brand strategist, guiding his clients through comprehensive discussions and discovery processes to help them nail their branding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;12 years into his practice, he realized two key things: he enjoyed the initial client meetings way more than the design/production work, and he knew that clients required less of a finding phase, but more of a true strategy phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This led Fabian to create his 8-hour Resonaid workshop: an in-depth strategy session he conducts with clients to unearth the core of their brand. Now, &lt;strong&gt;Fabian’s sharing this exact same process with creatives like you to guide clients to a strong brand strategy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://eresonaid.thinkific.com/pages/brandstrategist/?ref=981461&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5f7b40ef527e19b52635dd12_eResonaid_Logo_Reverse.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;eResonaid logo.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is eResonaid?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;eResonaid is a comprehensive workshop based on Fabian’s experience running client meetings and brand strategy sessions. The framework consists of passed-down, tried and true modules Fabian has derived over the years working with some of the biggest brands in the world. It’s his step-by-step process to distill down the most important details to define a company, culture, and story while captivating an audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This workshop is one of the most essential tools you can add to your belt if you’re looking to build a knockout brand either for yourself or your clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a graphic designer, marketer, or brand practitioner in need of a better process to get to a stronger brand strategy, or a beginner looking for a great place to start, eResonaid is for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sounding good so far? &lt;a href=&#34;https://eresonaid.thinkific.com/pages/brandstrategist/?ref=981461&#34;&gt;Click here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about eResonaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Go from pixel pusher to consultant&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;eResonaid is taught by Fabian in the exact same way he would direct and engage with a client. It’s your opportunity to replicate and use his process for yourself, including what questions to ask, how to set the stage for each module of discussion, and how to conduct the overall workshop with a potential client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if you’re not ready to put the lessons into practice with your clients just yet, you can implement these same steps towards your own creative business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This framework is bullet-proof, tested 150 times with clients around the world, at an engagement level of $10,000 per session. The concepts in eResonaid aren’t hypothetical. They’re proven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The craziest part? You can essentially steal this $10,000 process for less than $700.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://eresonaid.thinkific.com/pages/brandstrategist/?ref=981461&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5f7b413bc3e29e54debf42a9_eRESONAID_CourseScreenshots_c6.png&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;Example of what the eResonaid curriculum looks like inside the student portal.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What you’ll learn&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside this workshop, you’ll get the full scope of the strategy process, and grasp these key components:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brand Positioning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Mission &amp;amp; Vision&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Shared Core Values&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ownable Brand Differentiators&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Target Audience Personas&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Brand DNA&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Plus much, much more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;eResonaid has the potential to change the lives of graphic designers offering brand strategy workshops to their clients. You can do less work, make more money, and feel more fulfilled being part of the decision-making process for businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this workshop, you can complete all modules in a matter of hours &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; put them into practice immediately. You can move through the concepts as fast or as slow as you’d like, and you’ll have lifetime access any time you may need a refresher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to start conducting brand strategy workshops at a premium, &lt;a href=&#34;https://eresonaid.thinkific.com/pages/brandstrategist/?ref=981461&#34;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to enroll in the eResonaid program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Build a flourishing brand&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way a company positions itself greatly impacts its ability to stand above the noise and build a loyal audience. When it comes to your business and your client’s business, launching a compelling brand is crucial to determining success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with the eResonaid framework in hand, you can guarantee it. You can go from passive order-taker to involved decision-maker with clients from day one. And you can demand a premium price that could change your business, and even your life, around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re ready to dive into the workshop, Fabian’s ready to show you the ropes. &lt;a href=&#34;https://eresonaid.thinkific.com/pages/brandstrategist/?ref=981461&#34;&gt;Click here to enroll&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Are Courses from The Futur Worth It?</title>
    <updated>2020-09-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2020-09-04:/blog/courses-from-chris-do-the-futur-worth-it</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around this time, we had discovered a major gap in creative education. We realized that across the board, there was a serious lack of business acumen. Creatives didn&amp;#39;t know how to sell their work—or even price it for that matter—among many other crucial skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that point, our mission was clear: teach creatives of all levels about the business side of things so they can make money doing what they love. We made our classroom global, online, and accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we know the Internet is a pretty busy place. There are plenty of platforms to choose from if you&amp;#39;re looking to learn a new skill. Practically anywhere you look, it seems like a new digital course pops up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re a creative looking to sharpen your craft or add some business chops to your belt, you might be wondering...are our courses right for you? And are they worth it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer that, we&amp;#39;ll give you the full scoop on who we are, our experience as creative professionals, and how our courses are structured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who We Are&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re industry professionals, first and foremost. Our team is made up of creative talent across branding, graphic design, motion graphics, animation, illustration, UX/UI design, cinematography, photography, marketing, and more. Together, we&amp;#39;ve got a collective 60+ years of experience in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About Chris Do&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Founder and CEO, Chris Do, has been in the industry for 25 years. He started out like many of you: a designer with dreams of starting his own creative business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1995, he launched Blind, a motion &amp;amp; brand design consultancy in Santa Monica, California. Chris and his team at Blind have worked with some of the world&amp;#39;s biggest brands like Audi, Nike, Snapchat, Google, and Xbox. Blind&amp;#39;s work has been recognized by national and international organizations such as the Emmy’s, Clio, Effie Gold, Huffington Post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lynda.com/&#34;&gt;Lynda.com&lt;/a&gt;, Webbie, and Communication Arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of his business credentials, Chris has taught sequential design for over 15 years at ArtCenter, as well as Otis College of Art and Design. He has lectured all over the world at conferences such as AIGA National Design Conference, Birmingham Design Festival, Awwwards New York/San Francisco/Amsterdam, AIGA Miami, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About Our Team&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our online educators create content and courses here at The Futur based on insights and stories from their unique, individual journeys as creative professionals to help others navigate their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/team/ben-burns&#34;&gt;Mr. Ben Burns&lt;/a&gt; is the Chief Operating Officer at The Futur and the Digital Creative Director at Blind. Ben has over a decade of experience in design, focusing on branding and UI/UX. He&amp;#39;s worked with clients like Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, and AMC. Before entering the creative field, Ben served as a Narcotics Agent and as a Sergeant in the Army National Guard. (We can&amp;#39;t believe it either.) When he went all-in on his design career, he scaled his small design agency to a team of five and increased their average engagement size from $1,000 to $40,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Chief Content Officer and Creative Director at Blind, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/team/matthew-encina&#34;&gt;Matthew Encina&lt;/a&gt;, has over 15 years of experience in design, advertising, and content creation. His work has won multiple awards, including 3 Clios for his work with Xbox, and 3 Webby Awards for &amp;#34;Ink,&amp;#34; the groundbreaking interactive music video for Coldplay. Beyond the digital screen, Matthew speaks about his experiences in the industry at international conferences and events, such as TEDxCSULB, the Youtube Creator Workshop, and CTNxAnimation Expo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/team/greg-gunn&#34;&gt;Greg Gunn&lt;/a&gt;, our Chief Creative Officer, has over 15 years under his belt in the fields of design, animation, directing, advertising, illustration, and content creation. During his time at Otis College of Design, Greg co-founded an animation and directing studio while working in the advertising field to direct and produce commercials. Greg has worked with a number of impressive clients, like Disney, Nickelodeon, and singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say...our team has been around the block a few times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about the entire Futur team and our contributors, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/team&#34;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to get to know us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What We Teach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Design Fundamentals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that our mission here is to help creative entrepreneurs scale successful futures, we think it&amp;#39;s important to start with the basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our creative courses are meant to help students level up, whether that&amp;#39;s through sharpening design skills, presenting work, or streamlining the creative process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what you&amp;#39;re looking to learn as far as creativity goes, we&amp;#39;ve got a course for it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/product-categories/creative-skills&#34;&gt;We cover a range of skills&lt;/a&gt; like color theory, logo design, typography, hand lettering, and more. These are just a few of our most popular creative courses:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Typography 01: Learn typography fundamentals to master design, type, and layout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logo Design 01: Want to charge more for your logo designs? Learn the skills the pros use to charge $10k and higher for logos.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stylescapes®: Clearly present ideas to clients to eliminate revisions, and hit their expectations of your design work on the mark.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Business Strategies&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a business is no easy feat—especially if you&amp;#39;re a creative at heart. The business side of things just doesn&amp;#39;t come naturally to us. That&amp;#39;s exactly why we&amp;#39;re here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want all creatives to understand their value in the marketplace and grasp the business strategies to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We do this by teaching students how to negotiate with clients, manage projects with teams, manage their money, how to send proposals, how to market themselves on social media, and so much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our business &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/product-categories/business-resources&#34;&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/product-categories/business-skills&#34;&gt;courses&lt;/a&gt; are meant to guide all creative professionals in the right direction.

Greg helped me by giving a really comprehensive overview of color. From theory to history, there is something for all types of designers to learn.”&lt;/em&gt; — Tommy Negrete&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;How to Negotiate&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things most creatives would rather &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; do is negotiate with clients.

    <title>Are Courses from The Futur Worth It?</title>
    <updated>2020-09-04T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2020-09-04:/blog/courses-from-chris-do-the-futur-worth-it</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around this time, we had discovered a major gap in creative education. We realized that across the board, there was a serious lack of business acumen. Creatives didn&amp;#39;t know how to sell their work—or even price it for that matter—among many other crucial skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From that point, our mission was clear: teach creatives of all levels about the business side of things so they can make money doing what they love. We made our classroom global, online, and accessible to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we know the Internet is a pretty busy place. There are plenty of platforms to choose from if you&amp;#39;re looking to learn a new skill. Practically anywhere you look, it seems like a new digital course pops up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you&amp;#39;re a creative looking to sharpen your craft, or add some business chops to your belt, you might be wondering...are our courses right for you? And are they worth it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To answer that, we&amp;#39;ll give you the full scoop on who we are, our experience as creative professionals, and how our courses are structured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who We Are&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re industry professionals, first and foremost. Our team is made up of creative talent across branding, graphic design, motion graphics, animation, illustration, UX/UI design, cinematography, photography, marketing, and more. Together, we&amp;#39;ve got a collective 60+ years of experience in the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About Chris Do&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Founder and CEO, Chris Do, has been in the industry for 25 years. He started out like many of you: a designer with dreams of starting his own creative business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1995, he launched Blind, a motion &amp;amp; brand design consultancy in Santa Monica, California. Chris and his team at Blind have worked with some of the world&amp;#39;s biggest brands like Audi, Nike, Snapchat, Google, and Xbox. Blind&amp;#39;s work has been recognized by national and international organizations such as the Emmy’s, Clio, Effie Gold, Huffington Post, &lt;a href=&#34;http://lynda.com/&#34;&gt;Lynda.com&lt;/a&gt;, Webbie, and Communication Arts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of his business credentials, Chris has taught sequential design for over 15 years at ArtCenter, as well as Otis College of Art and Design. He has lectured all over the world at conferences such as AIGA National Design Conference, Birmingham Design Festival, Awwwards New York/San Francisco/Amsterdam, AIGA Miami, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;About Our Team&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our online educators create content and courses here at The Futur based on insights and stories from their unique, individual journeys as creative professionals to help others navigate their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/team/ben-burns&#34;&gt;Mr. Ben Burns&lt;/a&gt; is the Chief Operating Officer at The Futur and the Digital Creative Director at Blind. Ben has over a decade of experience in design, focusing on branding and UI/UX. He&amp;#39;s worked with clients like Paramount Pictures, Universal Studios, and AMC. Before entering the creative field, Ben served as a Narcotics Agent and as a Sergeant in the Army National Guard. (We can&amp;#39;t believe it either.) When he went all-in on his design career, he scaled his small design agency to a team of five and increased their average engagement size from $1,000 to $40,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Chief Content Officer and Creative Director at Blind, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/team/matthew-encina&#34;&gt;Matthew Encina&lt;/a&gt;, has over 15 years of experience in design, advertising, and content creation. His work has won multiple awards, including 3 Clios for his work with Xbox, and 3 Webby Awards for &amp;#34;Ink,&amp;#34; the groundbreaking interactive music video for Coldplay. Beyond the digital screen, Matthew speaks about his experiences in the industry at international conferences and events, such as TEDxCSULB, the Youtube Creator Workshop, and CTNxAnimation Expo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/team/greg-gunn&#34;&gt;Greg Gunn&lt;/a&gt;, our Chief Creative Officer, has over 15 years under his belt in the fields of design, animation, directing, advertising, illustration, and content creation. During his time at Otis College of Design, Greg co-founded an animation and directing studio while working in the advertising field to direct and produce commercials. Greg has worked with a number of impressive clients, like Disney, Nickelodeon, and singer-songwriter Jeff Buckley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suffice it to say...our team has been around the block a few times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about the entire Futur team and our contributors, &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/team&#34;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt; to get to know us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What We Teach&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Design Fundamentals&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given that our mission here is to help creative entrepreneurs scale successful futures, we think it&amp;#39;s important to start with the basics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our creative courses are meant to help students level up, whether that&amp;#39;s through sharpening design skills, presenting work, or streamlining the creative process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what you&amp;#39;re looking to learn as far as creativity goes, we&amp;#39;ve got a course for it. &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/product-categories/creative-skills&#34;&gt;We cover a range of skills&lt;/a&gt; like color theory, logo design, typography, hand lettering, and more.

    <title>How to Deal with Objections</title>
    <updated>2020-08-21T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2020-08-21:/blog/how-to-deal-with-objections</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it. When it comes to sales conversations, hearing an objection from your prospect is inevitable. They&amp;#39;ll disagree with you on things like price, the size of your team, or whether you&amp;#39;re fit for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients almost &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have some form of “no” rolled up their sleeve. Finding what motivates their objections, though, is a mystery we have to solve in the sales cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to confront objections, especially if you’re trying to grow your business and land better clients. But not every “no” is concrete. In fact, you can turn it around. You just have to learn the communication tactics and negotiation strategies to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’re going to teach you how to deal with the most common client objections. You’ll learn how to anticipate, embrace, and respond to every one you hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know Their “No”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of objections you’ll come across in your sales conversations, but the three you’ll encounter the most are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;“You’re too expensive.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“You don’t have enough experience.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“You don’t know enough about this industry, product, etc.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every hesitation has its reason. Maybe the client’s spent too much money before. They could have had a sour experience. Maybe they worked with someone who didn’t do their research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to expect the client’s concerns. When you hear an objection, that’s not your cue to convince or persuade them into working with you. Your goal is to get to the root of their doubts and guide the client from their point of view to see yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledge Every Objection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some objections can leave you feeling pretty paralyzed. So how do you effectively move the conversation forward?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace the moment.&lt;/strong&gt; Now, this may take some getting used to, but it’s a vital step to understanding your prospect’s position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening—specifically active listening—is one of the strongest skills you can bring to the table. Listen more than you speak. As you listen intently, you’ll slowly start to pick up the clues in the client’s concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it’s your time to speak, repeat the client’s own words back to them in the form of a question. This shows them that you’re invested not just in the conversation, but in their worries as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients want to feel heard. Put simply, they want to know that someone gets them. Empathize and reassure them that any concerns they may have are valid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a more specific example of acknowledging objections, check out the video below. Chris acts as a freelance videographer negotiating with a client who won’t budge. You’ll see exactly how Chris embraces the client’s concerns, and eventually negotiates to get the win:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/AfL8sB7N4RI&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Respond&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions will serve as your guiding light when navigating through objections. You should always ask more than you tell. Try to understand the client’s point before introducing your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of asking questions, here are three ways to respond when clients say “no&amp;#34;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Embrace and Pivot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;To turn something negative to positive, you have to embrace the objection (which we covered above) and pivot. This is your chance to turn the conversation around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pivoting is the hard part. To do it successfully, you have to change the conversation, not the subject. Flip the opposition on its head once you’ve dug deeper into the client’s concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the client’s told you that you’re too expensive, for example, embrace and pivot by saying, “I understand you have a certain budget in mind, and maybe we are too expensive. It’s true: you can get this done for less elsewhere. If you&amp;#39;re searching for the cheapest price, I&amp;#39;m probably not the best choice. But if you&amp;#39;re looking for a specific result, I&amp;#39;d be happy to help.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Price Bracket or Anchor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price bracketing, or price anchoring, gives the client an idea of how much they’ll potentially spend if they hire you. Instead of estimating one number, say a range of numbers, and follow that with, “does a figure in this range work for you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s say the client is looking to have a website designed. They have a certain budget in mind, so they’d ask, “How much will this cost?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For a custom website design, I typically charge anywhere between $10,000 to $60,000. Does something in this range work for you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say the price before you show a price. The client’s reaction will reveal where their budget stands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this video, Chris briefly explains the concept of Price Bracketing, and how to deliver it in a client-facing setting:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/87CPZdh6FIc&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Kill the Engagement, and Retreat and Follow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his highly-acclaimed book, &lt;a href=&#34;http://amzn.to/2EVyIDH&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Win Without Pitching Manifesto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Blair Enns introduces us to the concept of killing the opportunity first. In other words: act like you don’t want the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technique of playing hard to get is a bit more advanced, but if you’re confident in your delivery, it can work in your favor. The dynamic between you and the client shifts, and suddenly, they’ll try to get &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to work with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just a few techniques to respond to objections. If you’re interested in learning more, check out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/how-to-negotiate&#34;&gt;How to Negotiate&lt;/a&gt; course. It’s an in-depth guide to dealing with the most challenging client questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to Negotiate covers Chris’s go-to selling technique: The Socratic Six framework. He’ll teach you how to know what clients want, how to sell without selling, and how to win more business, without being more aggressive.

The more you practice responding to different objections, the more ingrained the techniques become. Dealing with objections can become second-nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sales conversations, confidence is everything. When you believe in yourself and can speak emphatically, clients will take note immediately. Practice role-playing with friends or people in your network, and see how much more approachable negotiating can be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an example of a role-play scenario where Chris responds to the &amp;#34;vendor&amp;#39;s&amp;#34; objection that Chris&amp;#39;s price is too high:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RFk8ZmIDrFM&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Dealing with Objections is Only the Start&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need a little guidance, support, or even mentoring on how to handle objections, our &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/business-bootcamp&#34;&gt;Business Bootcamp&lt;/a&gt; program may be just what you need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business Bootcamp is an entirely self-paced masterclass on attracting, landing, and keeping better clients.

You can go through the module material at your own pace, and participate in the community for life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dealing with objections from clients is hardly half of the battle.

If you and the client realize a partnership isn’t feasible, provide value to them anyway. Refer them to someone who can do the job. When you genuinely help others, it will come back to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know that objections are inevitable throughout the sales cycle, but how you deal with them is the difference between winning more business and staying exactly where you are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipate, embrace, and respond to objections in a way that exudes confidence and credibility.

    <title>How to Deal with Objections</title>
    <updated>2020-08-21T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it. When it comes to sales conversations, hearing an objection from your prospect is inevitable. They&amp;#39;ll disagree with you on things like price, the size of your team, or whether you&amp;#39;re fit for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients almost &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; have some form of “no” rolled up their sleeve. Finding what motivates their objections, though, is a mystery we have to solve in the sales cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to confront objections, especially if you’re trying to grow your business and land better clients. But not every “no” is concrete. In fact, you can turn it around. You just have to learn the communication tactics and negotiation strategies to make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’re going to teach you how to deal with the most common client objections. You’ll learn how to anticipate, embrace, and respond to every one you hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know Their “No”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;em&gt;plenty&lt;/em&gt; of objections you’ll come across in your sales conversations, but the three you’ll encounter the most are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;“You’re too expensive.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“You don’t have enough experience.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;“You don’t know enough about this industry, product, etc.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every hesitation has its reason. Maybe the client’s spent too much money before. They could have had a sour experience. Maybe they worked with someone who didn’t do their research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to expect the client’s concerns. When you hear an objection, that’s not your cue to convince or persuade them into working with you. Your goal is to get to the root of their doubts and guide the client from their point of view to see yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledge Every Objection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some objections can leave you feeling pretty paralyzed. So how do you effectively move the conversation forward?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embrace the moment.&lt;/strong&gt; Now, this may take some getting used to, but it’s a vital step to understanding your prospect’s position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening—specifically active listening—is one of the strongest skills you can bring to the table.

    <title>I Copied a Year&#39;s Worth of Seth Godin&#39;s Writing in a Week.</title>
    <updated>2020-07-13T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2020-07-13:/blog/i-copied-a-years-worth-of-seth-godins-writing-in-a-week</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The age-old exercise writers (still) swear by today&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve wanted to improve my writing. When I looked up ways to improve your writing, one exercise popped up everywhere as a recommendation. To become a better writer, you have to copy the great ones. This is known as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jenmanuel.com/process-tips/write-best-story-ever-one-epic-exercise/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;“Copywork.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The format of the exercise looks this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick a book or author you aspire to write like&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy a page of their text, word for word, every day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow up by moving into your writing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to understand how the author writes and expresses their ideas. This was practiced by many famous authors throughout history. And it&amp;#39;s an exercise many still swear by today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learning new writing styles,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improving your vocabulary,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Best of all) overcoming creative block by forming a habit of writing every day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;One year, in one week&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Copywork exercise looked promising. For the sake of documenting this, and out of my curiosity, I wanted to see if I could do this daily writing exercise, but condense an entire year’s worth of work in just one week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The plan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author I chose to study was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sethgodin.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt;. He’s the author of 19 best-selling books. He’s a prolific writer who posts to his &lt;a href=&#34;https://seths.blog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog every single day&lt;/a&gt;, which has over 7500 entries. He’s been on &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/kZmxAOHyDBI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our show&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve taken his &lt;a href=&#34;https://altmba.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AltMBA&lt;/a&gt; course. Seth Godin has a way with using few words, yet having great impact. Something I highly admire and want to emulate in my writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My goals for the seven day Copywork challenge:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy 365 entries from Seth’s Blog&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply what I learned by writing 3 articles of my own. &lt;em&gt;(Which is sadly the average amount of articles I post in a whole year).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn how to write like Seth Godin. &lt;em&gt;Specifically, if I can communicate an idea with fewer words while having the same impact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here’s what (really) happened&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/By-_gbXjEEM&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/By-_gbXjEEM&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch the video to see how the seven days played out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the first day of writing, &lt;/strong&gt;I went to Seth Godin’s blog and started by copying his top 100 posts.

I told myself to forget the daily quota of entries, and to focus on retention. This small tweak helped me adjust my relationship with the exercise; it changed from frustration to enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking the pressure off the numbers helped me get a lot more out of each blog post I rewrote. This helped to serve my goal better, which was to understand how Seth writes, so I can emulate the best qualities into my work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly Seth’s writing became a lot more clear to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Then magic happened&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The second part of this challenge was to write 3 original articles of my own.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Once I changed gears, &lt;/strong&gt;to focus on my thoughts, it just flowed. It was unlike anything I’ve felt before as a writer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Typically it takes me a few weeks to get a written article out. I usually spend a lot of time coming up with the draft, refining it, until I feel like it’s decent enough to be seen by the public.

My body was already in motion. And because I identified a few writing qualities I wanted to emulate from Seth, I had a set of very clear constraints to work within. This helped me focus on sharing my idea, rather than thinking about the form it would take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I created my &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@matthewencina/you-dont-really-want-it-you-just-say-you-do-c1725a74098d?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=9b1cccef9dc7212c0717ce92fb0546ae&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;first post for this exercise&lt;/a&gt;, in under two hours. &lt;em&gt;And I was happy with it.&lt;/em&gt; It was the fastest I’ve ever written and published something. &lt;em&gt;To be honest, the majority of that time was spent selecting the right cover image. It wasn’t even the writing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt the same magic when writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@matthewencina/dont-use-auto-correct-e371062e5ecd?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=e91d63ea071b23dfdab3c64152a27662&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@matthewencina/ten-ways-to-practice-better-and-stick-to-it-7277e2fa3aeb?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=fb1b8d11500ce4d1631d8674f7460dad&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;third articles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5f07df97958c7d39b0aa94d5_1*Fxg6CxhBG890xU3EqeOptg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The results of my one-week writing challenge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a week doing this writing assignment, I was able to copy a total of &lt;strong&gt;102 blog posts from Seth Godin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I’m very short of the original goal of 365 entries, I am not disappointed at all. And that’s because I learned so much during this week. About myself, about Seth Godin’s writing style, and how much production I can crank out in a short amount of time under constraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Observations of Seth Godin’s writing style&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After going through so much of Seth’s writing, I recognized a lot of patterns and formulas he uses. Here are a few things I’ve observed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paradigm shift. &lt;/strong&gt;Seth uses each post to shift your paradigm. Taking something you think you know, and invites you to look at it from a different perspective. I thought this was a powerful way to engage a reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every post by him has this intent in mind. Knowing this helped me focus my writing, to make it purpose-driven. This also improved my ability to be a ruthless editor of my work, and strip down to only the essential words needed to communicate a thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response to the title. &lt;/strong&gt;Seth often uses an intriguing title that pulls you in. Once he’s hooked you, he often responds to his title in the first line of the post. Like a comedian setting up a joke, then delivering the punch line. Seth uses this technique to delight the reader and draw them in closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master of line breaks. &lt;/strong&gt;Just like a designer uses negative space, Seth uses line breaks to emphasize, pause, or create a dramatic shift in his writing. Something that I became more conscious of when it comes to how I compose my thoughts on a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These were just a few of the many that I’ve observed and emulated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A new process developed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beautiful thing about this challenge is that it forced me to create a system for learning. Rules to follow. A commitment to keep. And a better way to make sense of information, and apply it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5f07df97252de98026803812_1*2KRM3rM9VL-3YRErVaGHyw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I went through this process, I documented everything in &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/2MUXPMy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, to keep track of my progress. For each post, I rewrote everything word for word. I took notes on the key takeaways, and any patterns I observed in Seth’s writing style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5f07df9786ca4dd84ca7545e_1*A_4LP1vCX_Lcwq_qDk9PWA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also took meta notes about my personal reactions and emotional state. At the end of each day, I wrote a reflection log. Summarizing 3 things I learned. What I could do better tomorrow. And my closing thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5f07df974f8d0d395ac18c26_1*j5KFupDxfeVqvKVzOA_ltA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My process in 4 steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Intentional consumption. &lt;/strong&gt;I read each post with a clear goal in mind: to extract a lesson, and to make observations about Seth’s writing style. Actively seeking information helped me pay attention to what I was reading, versus just copying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Distilling and reflection. &lt;/strong&gt;I took notes to summarize what I learned in every post, which forced me to recall the information I had just read. This greatly helped with the retention issues I ran into at the beginning. I also took notes on my thoughts and feelings, which helped me make adjustments to my process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Creation. &lt;/strong&gt;The most important part of my process was the application of what I learned. The moment I started writing my articles, emulating Seth’s style of writing, I committed to memory what I had been copying and observing. That’s because I went from passive learning to active learning. &lt;em&gt;The most effective way to retain information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Adjust. &lt;/strong&gt;When you design a new system to follow, you have to make iterative adjustments to improve its effectiveness. When I noticed that chasing a daily quota of 52 entries became counter-productive towards my goal, I changed my process to focus on the quality of consumption, &lt;em&gt;not the quantity.&lt;/em&gt; This adjustment greatly improved my relationship with the exercise and what I got out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unexpected afterglow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this one week challenge, I published 3 original articles. &lt;em&gt;That’s as much as I normally do in a whole year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even though the challenge is over, I’ve experienced a bit of an afterglow effect from it. I still feel the itch to read, to write, and make. It’s like the ink from my pen can’t stop flowing, and I have to get something on paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since completing this writing challenge, I wrote 6 more posts in the following week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, my writing productivity is exponentially higher because I developed a habit and have momentum I’m building on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m so happy with the results of this challenge, that I’m continuing this exercise,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with a new author to learn from (“The War of Art” by Steven Pressfield). I know there’s much I can learn in between the pages of this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to become a better writer, I highly recommend Copywork as an exercise. It’s an easy and effective way to build momentum and learn. &lt;/strong&gt;If you do plan to take this challenge on, don’t feel obligated to do it all in a week. Take it slow, give it time, and focus on building the habit of practice. Also, make sure to reflect on and apply what you learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to leave you with this quote I read from Seth Godin’s blog about writer’s block, which has encouraged me to write more in public:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Writer’s block isn’t hard to cure. Just write poorly. Continue to write poorly, in public, until you can write better. Do it every day. Every single day. If you know you have to write something every single day, even a paragraph, you will improve your writing. If you’re concerned with quality, of course, then not writing is the problem, because zero is perfect and without defects. Shipping nothing is safe.”&lt;p&gt;- Seth Godin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>I Copied a Year&#39;s Worth of Seth Godin&#39;s Writing in a Week.</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The age-old exercise writers (still) swear by today&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve wanted to improve my writing. When I looked up ways to improve your writing, one exercise popped up everywhere as a recommendation. To become a better writer, you have to copy the great ones. This is known as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.jenmanuel.com/process-tips/write-best-story-ever-one-epic-exercise/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;“Copywork.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The format of the exercise looks this:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pick a book or author you aspire to write like&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy a page of their text, word for word, every day&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow up by moving into your writing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to understand how the author writes and expresses their ideas. This was practiced by many famous authors throughout history. And it&amp;#39;s an exercise many still swear by today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The benefits include:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learning new writing styles,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Improving your vocabulary,&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;(Best of all) overcoming creative block by forming a habit of writing every day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;One year, in one week&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Copywork exercise looked promising. For the sake of documenting this, and out of my curiosity, I wanted to see if I could do this daily writing exercise, but condense an entire year’s worth of work in just one week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The plan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author I chose to study was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sethgodin.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Seth Godin&lt;/a&gt;. He’s the author of 19 best-selling books. He’s a prolific writer who posts to his &lt;a href=&#34;https://seths.blog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog every single day&lt;/a&gt;, which has over 7500 entries. He’s been on &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/kZmxAOHyDBI&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;our show&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve taken his &lt;a href=&#34;https://altmba.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;AltMBA&lt;/a&gt; course. Seth Godin has a way with using few words, yet having great impact. Something I highly admire and want to emulate in my writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My goals for the seven day Copywork challenge:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Copy 365 entries from Seth’s Blog&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Apply what I learned by writing 3 articles of my own. &lt;em&gt;(Which is sadly the average amount of articles I post in a whole year).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Learn how to write like Seth Godin. &lt;em&gt;Specifically, if I can communicate an idea with fewer words while having the same impact.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Here’s what (really) happened&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/By-_gbXjEEM&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/By-_gbXjEEM&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch the video to see how the seven days played out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On the first day of writing, &lt;/strong&gt;I went to Seth Godin’s blog and started by copying his top 100 posts. I figured this would be a good place to start since he hand selected them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I blocked out my day into (4) 90-minute &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/ybaom7OVtIw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;focus sprints&lt;/a&gt; of uninterrupted writing time, followed by 30-minute breaks to decompress.

It wasn’t even the writing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I felt the same magic when writing &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@matthewencina/dont-use-auto-correct-e371062e5ecd?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=e91d63ea071b23dfdab3c64152a27662&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my second&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/@matthewencina/ten-ways-to-practice-better-and-stick-to-it-7277e2fa3aeb?source=friends_link&amp;amp;sk=fb1b8d11500ce4d1631d8674f7460dad&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;third articles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5f07df97958c7d39b0aa94d5_1*Fxg6CxhBG890xU3EqeOptg.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The results of my one-week writing challenge&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a week doing this writing assignment, I was able to copy a total of &lt;strong&gt;102 blog posts from Seth Godin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I’m very short of the original goal of 365 entries, I am not disappointed at all. And that’s because I learned so much during this week. About myself, about Seth Godin’s writing style, and how much production I can crank out in a short amount of time under constraint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Observations of Seth Godin’s writing style&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;After going through so much of Seth’s writing, I recognized a lot of patterns and formulas he uses. Here are a few things I’ve observed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paradigm shift. &lt;/strong&gt;Seth uses each post to shift your paradigm. Taking something you think you know, and invites you to look at it from a different perspective. I thought this was a powerful way to engage a reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every post by him has this intent in mind. Knowing this helped me focus my writing, to make it purpose-driven. This also improved my ability to be a ruthless editor of my work, and strip down to only the essential words needed to communicate a thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response to the title. &lt;/strong&gt;Seth often uses an intriguing title that pulls you in. Once he’s hooked you, he often responds to his title in the first line of the post. Like a comedian setting up a joke, then delivering the punch line. Seth uses this technique to delight the reader and draw them in closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master of line breaks. &lt;/strong&gt;Just like a designer uses negative space, Seth uses line breaks to emphasize, pause, or create a dramatic shift in his writing. Something that I became more conscious of when it comes to how I compose my thoughts on a blank page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These were just a few of the many that I’ve observed and emulated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A new process developed&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beautiful thing about this challenge is that it forced me to create a system for learning. Rules to follow. A commitment to keep. And a better way to make sense of information, and apply it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5f07df97252de98026803812_1*2KRM3rM9VL-3YRErVaGHyw.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I went through this process, I documented everything in &lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/2MUXPMy&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, to keep track of my progress. For each post, I rewrote everything word for word. I took notes on the key takeaways, and any patterns I observed in Seth’s writing style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5f07df9786ca4dd84ca7545e_1*A_4LP1vCX_Lcwq_qDk9PWA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also took meta notes about my personal reactions and emotional state. At the end of each day, I wrote a reflection log. Summarizing 3 things I learned. What I could do better tomorrow. And my closing thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5f07df974f8d0d395ac18c26_1*j5KFupDxfeVqvKVzOA_ltA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My process in 4 steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Intentional consumption. &lt;/strong&gt;I read each post with a clear goal in mind: to extract a lesson, and to make observations about Seth’s writing style. Actively seeking information helped me pay attention to what I was reading, versus just copying it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Distilling and reflection. &lt;/strong&gt;I took notes to summarize what I learned in every post, which forced me to recall the information I had just read. This greatly helped with the retention issues I ran into at the beginning. I also took notes on my thoughts and feelings, which helped me make adjustments to my process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Creation. &lt;/strong&gt;The most important part of my process was the application of what I learned. The moment I started writing my articles, emulating Seth’s style of writing, I committed to memory what I had been copying and observing. That’s because I went from passive learning to active learning. &lt;em&gt;The most effective way to retain information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Adjust. &lt;/strong&gt;When you design a new system to follow, you have to make iterative adjustments to improve its effectiveness. When I noticed that chasing a daily quota of 52 entries became counter-productive towards my goal, I changed my process to focus on the quality of consumption, &lt;em&gt;not the quantity.&lt;/em&gt; This adjustment greatly improved my relationship with the exercise and what I got out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Unexpected afterglow&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;During this one week challenge, I published 3 original articles. &lt;em&gt;That’s as much as I normally do in a whole year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even though the challenge is over, I’ve experienced a bit of an afterglow effect from it. I still feel the itch to read, to write, and make. It’s like the ink from my pen can’t stop flowing, and I have to get something on paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since completing this writing challenge, I wrote 6 more posts in the following week.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, my writing productivity is exponentially higher because I developed a habit and have momentum I’m building on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m so happy with the results of this challenge, that I’m continuing this exercise,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;with a new author to learn from (“The War of Art” by Steven Pressfield). I know there’s much I can learn in between the pages of this book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you want to become a better writer, I highly recommend Copywork as an exercise. It’s an easy and effective way to build momentum and learn. &lt;/strong&gt;If you do plan to take this challenge on, don’t feel obligated to do it all in a week. Take it slow, give it time, and focus on building the habit of practice. Also, make sure to reflect on and apply what you learn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to leave you with this quote I read from Seth Godin’s blog about writer’s block, which has encouraged me to write more in public:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Writer’s block isn’t hard to cure. Just write poorly. Continue to write poorly, in public, until you can write better. Do it every day. Every single day. If you know you have to write something every single day, even a paragraph, you will improve your writing. If you’re concerned with quality, of course, then not writing is the problem, because zero is perfect and without defects. Shipping nothing is safe.”&lt;p&gt;- Seth Godin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>6 Tips to Help You Get Hired Out of Design School</title>
    <updated>2020-06-15T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2020-06-15:/blog/get-hired-out-of-design-school</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graduation is an enormous accomplishment for design students across the board. It’s a day where all your hard work, sleepless nights, weekends spent in the library, and excessive caffeine consumption are celebrated alongside family, fellow classmates, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also the day you realize the real world is waiting for you right around the corner, and you’ve got to find a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some programs teach students how to get hired out of design school, others seem to leave that out of the curriculum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read on to learn the six things you can do to increase your chances of landing a job after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Put Effort in Your Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filling out job applications is not exactly at the top of the list of ‘Most Exciting Things to Do.’ But, as we’re sure you know, it ranks high on your priorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying for jobs requires intentional energy and effort. We recommend choosing where you apply carefully, rather than fill out 20 applications daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by picking out, say, 10 companies you could see yourself working for. Then, do a little investigating. Find out who founded the company, what their current challenges look like, what services/products they offer, and who their competitors are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use this information to gauge whether or not you’d be a good fit. Are your skills a match for the company&amp;#39;s efforts?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Show your interest in them by following them on social media and building a relationship with them. That way when graduation rolls around, a relationship with your potential employer is already established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don’t recommend asking for jobs via direct message (DM) or even email. Relationships are not built on what you can get out of another person. Focus on setting the foundation first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be yourself, be genuine, and show the potential employer that you want to build a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Get Uncomfortable, and Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Networking, while intimidating, is absolutely necessary—especially if you want to try to secure a job out of design school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The friendships and connections you make with other creative individuals are vital, even more so after graduation. It’s important to keep these connections going and continuously expand your network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to start getting your name out there is to attend design meetups and networking events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, we know what you’re thinking: “I’m not a designer yet!”But if you’re in design school, guess what? &lt;strong&gt;You’re a designer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t wait to “be” something to attend meetups and events. Just through networking alone, you learn from other designers of all experience levels, make important connections, and start to build a reputation as a designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And hey, you never know which conversation could be the one to kick off your design career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get uncomfortable, and go network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Work Towards Your Dream Job&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re just guessing here, but you probably have your sights set on landing your dream job. But here’s the thing: you probably won’t land it right out of school. It could happen in the near or distant future, but if it doesn’t happen right out of school, don’t get discouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your first job doesn’t have to be at a big-name, globally-renowned agency. Because no matter what your first design job looks like, we guarantee you will learn something from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether at your desk, through an online course, or even on YouTube, you can learn anything anywhere, and improve your skills with each passing day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, you can keep your eyes open for other opportunities, and continue to send out applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your dream job is out there, and if you want it, you have to work for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Move With the Market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world has never been so connected quite like it is today. Anyone, anywhere in the world, can work wherever they want. Companies are more open to and accepting of remote work than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, if the city you currently live in isn’t exactly bursting with design opportunities, find them elsewhere. Don’t limit your job opportunities to your postal code. Instead, go where the market is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market could be hot in the United States, the UK, Germany, Spain, Japan—anywhere. Keep your eyes on its movement and make yourself available to opportunities that pop up there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start to think about job opportunities on a global scale, not only local.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Build Your Website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every recruiter, hiring manager, or potential employer is going to ask to see your website. So it’s pretty important to make sure you have one that’s up-to-date and includes relevant samples of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We suggest you register your domain with your full name, if possible. If you have a long name or one that’s difficult to spell, try modifying or shortening it in a way that’s memorable and easy to type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your website doesn’t have to be hyper-complex; in fact, it’s better to keep it simple. We recommend you design your website in a way that’s familiar and simple to navigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone looking at your website is only going to spend a few minutes on it. So it’s critical you clearly say what you want to be hired for on your site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can’t expect a recruiter or hiring manager to look through each piece of your portfolio and figure out what you want to do. &lt;strong&gt;You have to tell them&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be as specific as you can, and show only the pieces of work that back up what you’re saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Nail the Interview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interviews are understandably nerve-wracking. You definitely don’t want all the hard work and preparation you’ve done to crumble the second you start talking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The secret to nailing your job interview is to &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; focus on yourself. Instead, focus on what the company you’re interviewing for wants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you have to say to instantly separate yourself from other candidates is this: “I have plenty of stuff I can review with you, but before I get to that, I want to know: what’s important for you to see? This way I can cater what I show to you so it’s relevant and productive for our conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody,&lt;/strong&gt; and we mean &lt;strong&gt;nobody&lt;/strong&gt;, says this in interviews because candidates are led to believe the interview is an opportunity to only talk about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to knock the interview out of the park, ask the interviewer the questions instead, and continue the conversation based on their answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before You Go…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope you start putting these six tips into practice so you can walk out of school with a certificate &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; job offer in hand. If you’re consistent in your effort, go out and network, research opportunities, and practice refining your skills, you’re already 10 steps ahead of your classmates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more tips and guidance, check out the video below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvUPNobpqZ4&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

This way I can cater what I show to you so it’s relevant and productive for our conversation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nobody,&lt;/strong&gt; and we mean &lt;strong&gt;nobody&lt;/strong&gt;, says this in interviews because candidates are led to believe the interview is an opportunity to only talk about themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to knock the interview out of the park, ask the interviewer the questions instead, and continue the conversation based on their answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before You Go…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hope you start putting these six tips into practice so you can walk out of school with a certificate &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; job offer in hand.

    <title>How to Make a Director&#39;s Treatment</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to pitching an idea that only lives in your head, how do you get clients on board? Obviously, they can’t take a walk inside your brain. Your presentation, then, has to give clients clear, concise insight into what you&amp;#39;re thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re a novice or experienced video creator, you know what it’s like to share your concepts and ideas with potential clients. There’s an evident amount of pressure to knock the socks off of your potential client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if you’ve ever prepared and presented a video concept for a client, only to be rejected and sent back to the drawing board, there’s a good chance you’re missing an important piece of the process: &lt;strong&gt;a director’s treatment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’re going to cover what a director’s treatment is, how they’re prepared, and how they can help you land your dream clients and projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Director’s Treatment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A director’s treatment is a document that clearly outlines all elements of a film, music video, commercial, or TV pilot. It’s typically used by filmmakers, directors, television producers, or any other video professional pitching an idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A director’s treatment consists of the vision for the story, visual style, soundtrack, and characters, while communicating important scenes, story plots, and sequences to evoke a specific tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director’s treatment is an important tool in the pre-production process to give potential clients a clear roadmap of what to expect from the final video.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be noted, then, that the director’s treatment is what helps seal the deal in your pitches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5ebf0ae6c2db9ef2c3da32fd_DT-example.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;An example Director&amp;#39;s Treatment, showing the story with the visual.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Do You Need to Prepare a Director’s Treatment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like we mentioned earlier, you simply can’t open up your brain and invite potential clients to have a look around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You could put together the most mind-blowing speech and romance the client with your vivid words, but at the end of the day, it won’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re a video creator, after all; visuals are your right hand (or left…we didn’t forget about you, lefties). Don’t forget this when you’re pitching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The director’s treatment is what bridges the gap between your ideas and your client’s. It’s a vital piece of pre-production that clearly shows the client what you’re envisioning to get the both of you aligned on how to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefits of making a director’s treatment far outweigh the costs. It reduces friction when production kicks off, instantly draws your client’s interest, and sets you apart from other directors and video creators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plus, you’ll significantly reduce the chance of your ideas being rejected. Because before you’ve even turned on the camera, your client’s already gotten a pretty good glimpse into what you have in store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here’s How to Make a Director’s Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you make a director’s treatment, you first have to know what the purpose of the project is. You can’t exactly pitch an idea without knowing what you’re working on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re in a meeting with a potential client, your main focus should be to unearth their goals. This meeting is meant for you to gather as much information from the client as possible so you can distill it down and synthesize it into a solution—AKA the director’s treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ll want to ask questions more than anything. Some questions to ask include: who is the target audience? What message needs to be communicated? Why is this video important to the viewer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asking questions is such a crucial piece to creating a knockout treatment. You’ll come out of the creative brief with clarity of what’s expected, and avoid running back and forth from the drawing board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there are three things you need to do before you design anything, and we cover them in depth in this video:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xM-0aeHbk5Y&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair Vivid Language with Beautiful Imagery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your goal is to get the client to see what you see; to land on the same vision based on the creative brief. As a visual storyteller, the words you choose to convey your ideas have to be just as strong as the imagery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing you’ll want to do is get comfortable talking about your work. You’ll want to speak in a way that helps the images in your director’s treatment come to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We put together this &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/resources/visual-vocabulary-worksheet&#34;&gt;free downloadable resource&lt;/a&gt; to help you broaden your visual vocabulary and communicate your ideas clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve prepared your director’s treatment, you’ll have to pair it with beautiful, high-quality images that guide the client through the story you’re trying to tell. These images are what we call &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/styleframes&#34;&gt;styleframes&lt;/a&gt;. They’re not just random photos you’ve collected on the web; they serve a very specific (and important) role when pitching your treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Styleframes help to guide the narrative you’re presenting to the client. They’re single frames that tell just as much of a compelling story as the words on the page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to get your director’s treatment signed off quickly, styleframes coupled with a strong visual vocabulary will help you do just that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/styleframes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5ebf0b45a31e3f8051403ea8_zombie_styleframe_DEMO.png&#34; alt=&#34;Styleframes give clients an inside look at what&amp;#39;s to come from a video project.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pitching Your Director’s Treatment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we’ve covered the two core components to make an effective director’s treatment, it’s time to pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitching is an essential piece to getting your director’s treatment signed and approved. Without a solid, air-tight pitch, it’s pretty difficult to sell your vision to the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the director’s treatment takes care of bringing your ideas to life with a powerful story and imagery, the pitch should knock your potential client out of the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pitch is your opportunity to get clients on board not just with your vision, but with you as a creative partner. It’s your chance to communicate your value while also selling your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you master the art of the pitch, you’ll have a higher chance of working with your dream clients, and get your projects approved before you shoot anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understandably, pitching is a pretty nerve-wracking thing to do. Selling ideas to clients isn’t exactly the easiest. Fortunately, we’ve got just the thing that will help you pitch with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conquer Every Pitch With The Pitch Kit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pitching is not just about presenting your ideas; it’s about presenting them in a valuable way.

Matthew is an award-winning creative director who has worked with Fortune 500 brands, music artists, and video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matthew has pitched, won, and directed projects for Xbox, Coldplay, and Playstation—just to name a few. The Pitch Kit is the result of Matthew’s 10+ years of experience in the industry pitching and proposing to globally recognized clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, he’s going to show you the ropes to developing a focused design process to pitch ideas that &lt;strong&gt;win&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pitch Kit will show you how to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pitch with confidence and clarity&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deliver air-tight pitches&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Translate the creative brief into an actionable idea&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask better questions in the discovery phase&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Align your client’s goals with their customer’s needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And much, much more…&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making the director’s treatment is only half of the battle.

    <title>3 Tips to Have a Long Creative Career</title>

    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2020-05-06:/blog/3-tips-to-have-a-long-creative-career</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewencina.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Matthew Encina&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve been working as a creative professional as a designer, animator, and director over the past 15 years. Recently, I reviewed all of my old portfolio work. Going way back to 1998, when I was just starting my own creative journey, up till now working for big clients on some pretty amazing projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QowXUHYEzT8&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Staying motivated and trusting the process is a difficult thing to do. So what does it take to pursue a creative career? How can you stay relevant, motivated, and continue to grow in the long run?&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re just starting out, or are struggling to push forward, in this article I’ll be sharing the biggest lessons I’ve learned along the way, to help you navigate your own journey as a creative person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 1: Start before you’re ready.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything worth doing takes a lot of effort and along with it comes risk. The challenge for most of us is that we’re risk-averse. And we look for all the reasons why now is not a good time to pursue our next big idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, I pitched an idea to the band Coldplay, that I’d design an interactive music video for their song “Ink.” At the time, I really had no clue how to make it. I was nervous, cause I had very little experience in interactive design. And I almost pulled out of the project because, for a moment, I doubted my ability to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I jumped in head first, and I believed that I could figure it out. My resourcefulness kicked in. I called everyone in my network. I did a lot of research on the technology. And a few months later, I created my &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coldplay.com/ink/&#34;&gt;first-ever interactive music video&lt;/a&gt;. Had I closed up and avoided risk, because of fear and doubt, I would’ve missed out on one of the most rewarding projects of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ow2cZxpY2TE&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That &lt;strong&gt;“will figure it out”&lt;/strong&gt; mentality, I believe, is our superpower as creative human beings. We can see possibilities, where others cannot. And can come up with novel solutions to challenges, when we’re in a pinch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you have an opportunity in front of you, have confidence in yourself. Start before you’re ready, and push yourself beyond your comfort zone. Cause when you do, you’ll grow beyond your current abilities, and you’ll surprise yourself. You’ll realize how good you really are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 2: Failure is not the end. It’s a lesson for your future self.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failure sucks. It’s embarrassing, demoralizing and can bring your life to a screeching halt if you let it. &lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, right after graduating college, I decided to start a design studio called, BORN, with my school mates.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Life was good. Jobs were dropping in our lap. We were working with cool clients, like Linkin Park and Nissan, doing the kind of work we loved.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5eb1f7802966717ffa6209d5_2121678648_9a325f2720_o.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Our studio BORN, featured in STEP Magazine, 2008&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our studio BORN, featured as Top 25 Emerging Talent in STEP Magazine, 2008&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then in 2008, the housing market crashed in the United States, and brought the global economy down with it. The phones stopped ringing. We stopped getting clients. And I realized everything I didn&amp;#39;t know about running a business – especially in tough times&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our business became a burden rather than bringing us joy. So with a heavy heart, we decided to close our doors in 2009, and say goodbye to our little design studio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that experience left a deep scar on me, it was a humbling lesson that I&amp;#39;ll remember for life. It taught me that I’m not invincible, and that there will be challenges that will appear in front of me, that I won’t be prepared for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That experience revealed many gaps in my skills and knowledge that I wasn’t aware of at the time, but those became the things I worked on in the following years of my career. Now I’ve become more comfortable with disruption and pivoting when things change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re experiencing failure right now, just know, you’ll get through it. You’ll be stronger after it. Be willing to accept the situation and learn from it. And when you fail, ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Knowing what you know now, what will you do differently in the future?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The more you can embrace change, the more resilient you become towards the challenges life will throw at you. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Lesson 3: It all adds up. Nothing is a waste of time.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you asked me when I was 13, what I wanted to do when I grew up, I wouldn’t have been able to give you a clear answer. If you asked me today, what’s my big master plan,&lt;strong&gt; I still wouldn’t have an answer for you.&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, my career has been all over the place, without a real plan for anything. It was a lot of intuition and improvisation. Sometimes I took jobs out of necessity, and other times I intentionally chased things that piqued my curiosity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In high school my first job was taking customer orders at a local pizza shop. I think that experience laid the foundation of giving good customer service, which prepared me for dealing with client relationships many years later.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In college, I changed schools, and I changed majors. I’m glad I did because I ended up finding a very fruitful career in advertising. Designing, animating, and directing commercials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/b7iRxVnnaDA&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout my life, I spent hundreds of hours playing video games. Sure my parents thought it was a waste of time. But I could have never known that would lead me down a path of actually working on projects for Xbox and Playstation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also explored many mediums and tried a lot of things. I took up &lt;a href=&#34;https://thereveries.photos/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;photography&lt;/a&gt; to learn how to use cameras. I created &lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/50812984&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;short films&lt;/a&gt; to scratch my itch for my storytelling and editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, many of those pursuits didn’t amount to much in the short run. But looking back, I can see that all of those experiences have added up to the person I am, and the work I do today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bm9BrG5EiNA&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I would&amp;#39;ve never imagined myself as a person creating videos on YouTube. I never planned for it, yet every experience and pursuit I’ve had to this point, has prepared me for this. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think we all get anxious sometimes thinking about the future. Contemplating if what you’re doing right now is going to pay off?&lt;/strong&gt; Steve Jobs had the best way of addressing this in his 2005 &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/Hd_ptbiPoXM&#34;&gt;Commencement speech at Stanford.&lt;/a&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.” &lt;p&gt;– Steve Jobs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always trusted my gut and followed my curiosity. This has allowed me to discover things about myself and the world around me. So I encourage you all to do the same. Don’t settle. Chase what you love. and remember, every chapter in your story will add up. None of it is a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/WcIKtetf2p8&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the three most valuable lessons I’ve learned, looking back at the last 20+ years of my portfolio work. While it might look like “I’ve made it”, I’m far from being done. I’m still a work in progress – learning, changing, growing – just like you. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay curious. Keep exploring.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Learning How to Use Typography in Seven Weeks</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the upcoming weeks, Chris will be holding live critique sessions on our Academy channel for new and current Typography 01 students. Each week, students will receive a certain set of parameters to work with and submit their layouts to get live, on-the-spot feedback. With the help of type instructor and Creative Director, Milka Broukhim, both Chris and Milka will teach students how to break down type to use it effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because typography is such a crucial design skill to have, it makes it that much more intimidating to approach. But if you have someone helping to point you in the right direction, you&amp;#39;ll quickly learn to embrace this design discipline to take your layouts to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to participate and get your work critiqued by Chris for the next livestream, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/Type01_bl&#34;&gt;click here to join our global classroom in Typography 01&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have typography work of your own that you’d like to critique yourself as you watch and follow along, use this checklist:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Focal Point - What is drawing your eyes to a specific point on a layout?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Order - What are the most important pieces of information, and what order are they in?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Surprise - Where does contrast come into play?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Negative Space - Does the design have breathing room?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Details - Once items 1-4 are checked off, what additional details can you see?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a peek at the major takeaways from each feedback session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 1: One Weight, One Point Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this first exercise, students are working only with Helvetica Regular at an 8 point size. Here’s what we learned:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rivers in typography&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re just starting out with type, it’s highly advised you start by justifying your copy left. Our eyes focus on the content of the layout just as much as the negative space. If the text is force justified, it creates gaps, or rivers, that throw off the balance. In general, you want to avoid rivers.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Group items to an axis to make a focal point&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout your layout, elements should sit along an axis line to show that they’re from the same group. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proximity communicates grouping, so if you have items that are placed closely together along the same axis, that also tells our eyes that those components are related in some way.&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What grids are and what they’re used for&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grids help to keep things ordered, aligned, and balanced. They eliminate chaos and make layouts pleasing to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For more, watch the full critique here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/4h4RNmemzB0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 2: Two Weights, One Point Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For week two, type instructor Milka Broukhim joins Chris to help with the critiques. Milka has taught typography to over 1,500 students for 15 years at ArtCenter College of Design. Here are a couple of things we learned from Milka this week:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do bad work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it sounds counterproductive, it’s highly encouraged. The only way you’ll learn, as Milka puts it, is to do bad work. Make as many mistakes as possible to learn from them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soak up design wherever possible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we go through these critiques over the next few weeks, take note of where you can improve based on Chris’s feedback. Then, take it a step further and look for other sources of layout inspiration and instruction online, from other designers, or in books. &lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the full critique here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/vZUiUXKqVQA&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 3: One Weight, Two Point Sizes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milka Broukhim joins us for our third week of typography critiques. In this week’s session, Chris and Milka teach the students “how to see” based on their layouts using only one weight and two point sizes. Here’s what we learned:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master the fundamentals before you experiment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you jump into your layout design without some grasp of design fundamentals, you might get lost down the road. It’s important to keep the fundamentals in your back pocket at all times. Then, when you’ve got a good sense of them all, play and experiment away. The world of design is much bigger than you think.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing space disconnects ideas&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want to make sure that your body of text has a healthy amount of space between lines. This tells us that the copy is related.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose and function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Form and function work together. A beautiful visual layout only creates an impact when there’s purpose behind it. The form of the layout has to follow the purpose to make an effective design.&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the full critique here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wguk2Kg189Q&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 4: Two Weights, Two Point Sizes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re welcoming week four with a fresh new batch of layouts to critique with the help of Chris and Milka. Using two point sizes and two weights, here are some things we picked up this week:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dadaism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dadaism is a design movement that came around the time of World War I. Dadaism is a symbol of rebellion and artistic freedom; it celebrates the artist’s ability to break from the tight structures that were commonplace before the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many designers want to express their artistic side freely, and you should. Before you do, though, take a look at some of the layouts that came from the early days of Dadaism. You’ll see how designers were experimental yet purposeful in their execution of their layouts.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Make your elements talk to one another&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every layout you design is only impactful when every single element works together. As Milka points out in this week’s critique, she notes that she sees a lot of islands. There needs to be unity for your design to be both visually engaging and communicative. How do your elements relate to one another?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch week 4&amp;#39;s critique session here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NJnSsdI7B5I&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 5: Any Weight, Any Point Size&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Typography students walk into the the fifth week of critiques with looser parameters to work within. Chris and Milka review the work from multiple students, the good and the bad, to help you learn from your mistakes and where you can improve. Here&amp;#39;s what we took away from week five:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squint your eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see where you can polish up your layout, zoom out from the artboard and squint your eyes. What do you see first? What other elements are capturing your attention? Once you&amp;#39;ve pinpointed certain areas of your layout, zoom back in and make any necessary adjustments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difference in orientation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you break the orientation of elements—for example making one horizontal and the other vertical—you&amp;#39;re basically saying that the two are not related. In this case, with the title REZN8, separating the 8 and changing its orientation tells us it&amp;#39;s not related to the rest of the title, REZN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Piano Effect—and why you should avoid it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like piano keys changing from white to black, you want to avoid your typography following this same look. If you have a list of copy changing from bold to light every line, while it creates contrast and repetition, it becomes harder to look at, especially when grouped together. In this case, Milka advises implementing a gradient of weights instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch week 5&amp;#39;s critique here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGKOGXWLVlU&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 6: Rules &amp;amp; Shapes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our second to last round of typography critiques kicks off with reviewing the concept of grouping sections based on importance and hierarchy using rules and shapes. Here’s what we learned from Chris and Milka during this sixth round of critiques:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful of uppercase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to make the copy in a section all uppercase, there has to be a reason for it. While it is important, it’s also sometimes more difficult to read. Try to keep the use of uppercase for information on your layout that needs special attention. Keep it to a word or two in a section, not every word in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, you can use uppercase to your advantage. If you are trying to draw attention to a title, for example, then using all uppercase would be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make centered text work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re centering the main copy down the page, you’re surrendering your control over how a shape is built. But there is a way to make it work. You can have your content in the center of the page, but if you want to control the shape that forms from it, justify the text left so there&amp;#39;s a straight line down the side, rather than the text having various starting points down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the full critique from week 6 here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgAHGF6ZXk8&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 7: Experimental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our seventh and final week of critiques, students were encouraged to think outside the box and get experimental with their designs. Over the course of these past seven weeks, students have made major strides and improvements in their skills, but there&amp;#39;s still work to do. Milka and Chris join forces one last time to send the typography students on their way with new perspectives, ideas, and an understanding of how to level up their typography skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest takeaway from this last week was to let go of any and all fears when approaching layout design. As Milka puts it, it&amp;#39;s a layout; no one is going to get hurt. She candidly leaves students with some words of wisdom: &amp;#34;if you&amp;#39;re not having fun, you&amp;#39;re not doing it right.&amp;#34; That&amp;#39;s a motto we can definitely get behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the full critique from week 7 here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QjKNz980Bu4&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want your typography work critiqued by the pros?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/Type01_bl&#34;&gt;Sign up for our Typography 01 course&lt;/a&gt; for your chance to participate in future critique sessions like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

Milka has taught typography to over 1,500 students for 15 years at ArtCenter College of Design. Here are a couple of things we learned from Milka this week:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do bad work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it sounds counterproductive, it’s highly encouraged.

Using two point sizes and two weights, here are some things we picked up this week:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dadaism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dadaism is a design movement that came around the time of World War I. Dadaism is a symbol of rebellion and artistic freedom; it celebrates the artist’s ability to break from the tight structures that were commonplace before the war.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many designers want to express their artistic side freely, and you should.

Chris and Milka review the work from multiple students, the good and the bad, to help you learn from your mistakes and where you can improve. Here&amp;#39;s what we took away from week five:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squint your eyes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To see where you can polish up your layout, zoom out from the artboard and squint your eyes.

In this case, with the title REZN8, separating the 8 and changing its orientation tells us it&amp;#39;s not related to the rest of the title, REZN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Piano Effect—and why you should avoid it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like piano keys changing from white to black, you want to avoid your typography following this same look. If you have a list of copy changing from bold to light every line, while it creates contrast and repetition, it becomes harder to look at, especially when grouped together. In this case, Milka advises implementing a gradient of weights instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch week 5&amp;#39;s critique here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGKOGXWLVlU&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 6: Rules &amp;amp; Shapes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our second to last round of typography critiques kicks off with reviewing the concept of grouping sections based on importance and hierarchy using rules and shapes. Here’s what we learned from Chris and Milka during this sixth round of critiques:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be mindful of uppercase&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are going to make the copy in a section all uppercase, there has to be a reason for it. While it is important, it’s also sometimes more difficult to read. Try to keep the use of uppercase for information on your layout that needs special attention. Keep it to a word or two in a section, not every word in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, you can use uppercase to your advantage. If you are trying to draw attention to a title, for example, then using all uppercase would be appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make centered text work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re centering the main copy down the page, you’re surrendering your control over how a shape is built. But there is a way to make it work. You can have your content in the center of the page, but if you want to control the shape that forms from it, justify the text left so there&amp;#39;s a straight line down the side, rather than the text having various starting points down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the full critique from week 6 here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgAHGF6ZXk8&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Week 7: Experimental&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our seventh and final week of critiques, students were encouraged to think outside the box and get experimental with their designs. Over the course of these past seven weeks, students have made major strides and improvements in their skills, but there&amp;#39;s still work to do. Milka and Chris join forces one last time to send the typography students on their way with new perspectives, ideas, and an understanding of how to level up their typography skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest takeaway from this last week was to let go of any and all fears when approaching layout design. As Milka puts it, it&amp;#39;s a layout; no one is going to get hurt. She candidly leaves students with some words of wisdom: &amp;#34;if you&amp;#39;re not having fun, you&amp;#39;re not doing it right.&amp;#34; That&amp;#39;s a motto we can definitely get behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watch the full critique from week 7 here:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QjKNz980Bu4&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want your typography work critiqued by the pros?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bit.ly/Type01_bl&#34;&gt;Sign up for our Typography 01 course&lt;/a&gt; for your chance to participate in future critique sessions like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>8 Ways to Boost Your Productivity Working from Home</title>
    <updated>2020-03-31T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The opportunity to work from home is a dream for many. However, anyone who has worked from home at least once knows it’s half as hard as it looks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s almost impossible to concentrate on the project when your neighbor is mowing the lawn, your cat is meowing, or your mom is calling you every hour, sincerely believing that since you’re not in the office, her calls won’t disturb you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you work from home and struggle to boost productivity, try to use the following tips. Change your approach to work, and you&amp;#39;ll be amazed by the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eat healthy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://3to5marketing.com/health-tips-for-content-writers-to-stay-focused/&#34;&gt;Sticking to a healthy diet&lt;/a&gt; is one of the simplest ways to work effectively and feel good. If you tend to fuel your body with energy drinks, potato chips, and M&amp;amp;M’s, your productivity will continuously crash. A can of Red Bull might help you complete tonight’s project, but it won’t help you achieve adequate results in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to boost productivity, increase your intake of the foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals. To fuel your brain and increase the attention concentration, try consuming the following products on a regular basis:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Berries (e.g., blueberries, raspberries, strawberries)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nuts (e.g., almonds, cashews, walnuts)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Seeds (e.g., chia seeds, flax seeds, sunflower seeds)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avocados&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Whole grains (e.g., brown rice, oatmeal)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Greens (e.g., broccoli, kale)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Oily fish (e.g., salmon, tuna, sardines)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dark chocolate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to eat processed food less often, and reduce the consumption of sugars and carbs. Once you change your diet, you will start to feel a difference. You will have more energy to work on your projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exercise daily&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multiple scientific studies prove that regular physical exercise helps to boost creativity and productivity. So if you want to work effectively, you shouldn’t skip your workouts. Try to stay physically active all week long, and you will improve divergent and convergent thinking – the two basic components of creative thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth mentioning that you shouldn’t force yourself to do sports. Instead, find a kind of physical activity that you really enjoy. For instance, if working out at the gym isn’t your thing, you can attend Zumba classes or practice yoga at home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like sports at all, try something simple like walking. Walk 15,000 steps a day, and it will be enough. Just don’t sit in front of your computer all day long! Do at least some physical movements. Your brain and body need that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Challenge yourself to fight your laziness. Find a way to motivate yourself to start exercising. Here are a few tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find a friend to exercise with. You won’t skip a workout if you know that your friend is waiting for you to get moving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pay for a gym membership. Once you spend money on a gym membership, you’ll feel obliged to go.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow sports influencers who share how-tos and tips on social media. Every post they publish will remind you that you need to stand up from your chair and do a few exercises.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a small office at home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where do you usually work? Do you work at the kitchen table? Or prefer to do your work lying on your bed? Or maybe, you migrate from one spot to another?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you know how to stay productive working in a relaxing atmosphere, that’s great. But if your productivity is low, find a spot in your house to create a small office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, you don’t even need to have a spare room. The balcony, attic room, part of your living room, or any other corner all work well for this purpose. The spot for your home office should fit a small computer table with a comfy chair, and it should have access to natural light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time you step into your “home office”, your brain will turn on the “working mode”. It will help you to focus on your project and immerse yourself in the day’s work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Block social media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are over three billion social media users on the web. And I bet you’re one of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know that social media distractions could be costing you nearly &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.usejournal.com/how-unhacking-your-tech-can-improve-your-productivity-a513a8d966ab&#34;&gt;50 hours per month&lt;/a&gt;? If you check your social media profiles multiple times a day, it comes as no surprise that you can’t focus on your work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there is a solution that can save you. There are apps and tools like Focusme, Offtime, Appblock that help to block the sites you use the most for a specific period of time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if you work from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. and want to get rid of your Instagram addiction, you can install the app that will block access to social media sites. And even if you restart your laptop or smartphone, the app will not allow you to check what’s new on the Instagram feed during the specified hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule your day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know why so many people can’t &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/blog/your-most-productive-work-day&#34;&gt;stay productive&lt;/a&gt; working from home? They can’t find a perfect moment to start working on the project. All day, they ask themselves the same question: why should I start working right now if I can do it 15, 30, or 60 minutes later?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just because you don’t have to go to the office doesn’t mean you don’t need to schedule your day. Pick a specific time of the day (or night) to work and plan your tasks and activities. It will help you to stay organized and deliver projects on time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that you should schedule not only the hours of the work but also hours (or minutes) of the rest. You should give yourself enough time to relax and recharge during short and long breaks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a to-do list &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s also a good idea to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/biancabarratt/2019/01/30/how-to-write-a-to-do-list-that-youll-actually-stick-to/&#34;&gt;create a to-do list&lt;/a&gt;. Your to-do list may consist of work tasks only. Or, since you spend all day at home, it may include both: your work tasks and home tasks. For instance, your to-do list may look like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write a 1,000-word article for Client Z&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Create three social media posts for Client Y&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Edit the article for Client X&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Water my plants&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice yoga for 20 minutes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deep clean my living room&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you clearly understand what specific tasks you should complete during the day, you can manage your time more effectively. You can use your breaks to do things around the house. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, you can water your plants during your short break and practice yoga during your long break. It will help you to kill two birds with one stone. You’ll get distracted from your work during the break, and that will improve your concentration. Secondly, you will get more spare time after working hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spend some time outside of your house&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how much you love your house, you can’t spend 365 days a year within its walls. If you want to boost your productivity, you should spend some time out of your home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you planned to spend your weekend laying on your sofa and watching Netflix? Try to switch things up. Go out for a walk in the park, the beach, or around your neighborhood – whatever you decide to do, just don’t stay at your house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this so important? When you spend most of the time in one place, it may make you feel stuck, and it may hold you back from progressing in work. Change up your environment every now and then to get unstuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a perfect playlist for working &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a playlist for jogging and a playlist for driving, you might want to create a suitable playlist for working. Choose music tracks that inspire you and motivate you, but do not distract you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a rule, the lyrics of favorite songs distract a lot. So it’s better to pick songs in foreign languages or instrumental music. Some scientists say that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130107-can-mozart-boost-brainpower&#34;&gt;listening to classical music&lt;/a&gt; while working helps to boost productivity. So if you like the masterpieces created by Mozart, Bach, and Tchaikovsky, feel free to add them to your playlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you create your work playlist, upload chosen songs to your laptop or phone. Do not create a playlist on YouTube or other online platforms! Otherwise, you will get distracted by a cute cat video or other catchy content every time you open your playlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to boost your productivity, try out the tips in this article. When you aren’t afraid to bring small and big changes to your life, one by one, you’ll start to achieve all the goals you set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diana Nadim is a writer and editor who has a Master’s degree in Marketing.

Secondly, you will get more spare time after working hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spend some time outside of your house&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how much you love your house, you can’t spend 365 days a year within its walls. If you want to boost your productivity, you should spend some time out of your home. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you planned to spend your weekend laying on your sofa and watching Netflix? Try to switch things up. Go out for a walk in the park, the beach, or around your neighborhood – whatever you decide to do, just don’t stay at your house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is this so important? When you spend most of the time in one place, it may make you feel stuck, and it may hold you back from progressing in work. Change up your environment every now and then to get unstuck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a perfect playlist for working &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a playlist for jogging and a playlist for driving, you might want to create a suitable playlist for working. Choose music tracks that inspire you and motivate you, but do not distract you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a rule, the lyrics of favorite songs distract a lot. So it’s better to pick songs in foreign languages or instrumental music. Some scientists say that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20130107-can-mozart-boost-brainpower&#34;&gt;listening to classical music&lt;/a&gt; while working helps to boost productivity. So if you like the masterpieces created by Mozart, Bach, and Tchaikovsky, feel free to add them to your playlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you create your work playlist, upload chosen songs to your laptop or phone. Do not create a playlist on YouTube or other online platforms! Otherwise, you will get distracted by a cute cat video or other catchy content every time you open your playlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to boost your productivity, try out the tips in this article. When you aren’t afraid to bring small and big changes to your life, one by one, you’ll start to achieve all the goals you set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diana Nadim is a writer and editor who has a Master’s degree in Marketing.

    <title>What are Stylescapes?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;For us, our strategy relies on the use of Stylescapes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stylescapes are a carefully collected combination of images, textures, typography, and colors to communicate a certain look and feel of a brand, website, interior space, or any other design project. Think of them as moodboards taken to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stylescapes bridge the gap between your ideas and your client’s. They help to get both of you to agree on the design direction before you design anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use Stylescapes for virtually every design project we touch. They’re a vital piece to our creative process and how we keep our clients in the loop of where each project is headed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not already incorporating Stylescapes into your design process, stick around. You’re about to find out why you and your clients keep butting heads, and how you can significantly simplify your design projects going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Problem with Your Process&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many times have your clients said something like, “this isn’t what I pictured?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re in a discovery session with a client, there’s a lot that can get lost in translation. They say one thing, but you interpret it as something else entirely. Then when you break from the meeting, you jump into designing and prepare to knock their socks off with what you’ve made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you present your deliverable, though, they’re not on board. They ask you to try again. They may even do a little research of their own and tell you what to do based on what they found. You keep editing, revising, making last-minute adjustments, and presenting new concepts to them, but you’re not making any progress. You’ve lost focus on what this project is supposed to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, you’ve worked beyond the agreed scope, your client’s feeling frustrated, and you’re on the verge of calling it quits. Is any of this sounding familiar?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;See, without Stylescapes, there’s no direction to agree on. There’s no transparency or exchange of ideas for the design. And if there’s anything we’ve learned working with clients, it’s that they want to know where the design direction is headed. This is where Stylescapes play a critical role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5e7bd54183ca53a1bc7922ad_IM_Stylescape_ricky.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Example brand identity stylescape for Indy Mogul.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Need to Learn Your Client’s Language&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your client says “this isn’t what I pictured” you need to figure out what that is before you head to the drawing board. You don’t need a crystal ball or some magic spell to step inside their brains. You need to do something about your discovery process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through asking questions, you slowly start to figure out what your clients mean with each answer, but you can’t get the full picture with their words alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is you and your client don’t speak the same language. You’re coming from a variety of perspectives as a designer, strategist, and problem-solver. You might think you know more than your client in terms of the best direction for the project, but you don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, they’re coming to you to lean on your expertise and design talent, but the fate of their business is in your hands. Don’t forget that clients put their trust in you to deliver something that can squash whatever challenge they’re facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they make comments like, “I like the minimalist style,” or “I love so-and-so’s brand,” it’s important that you understand exactly what that means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;‍&lt;strong&gt;Stylescapes Tell You What Your Clients Want&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can essentially decode your client’s words with Stylescapes. Instead of coming back from the discovery session with a deliverable, you come back with one or a few Stylescapes to essentially ask them, “Is that what you were thinking?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stylescapes are meant to generate some sort of emotional response from the client when they see what’s in front of them. They’re also there to serve as a point of reference to establish the overall look and feel of the brand identity, digital product, music video, or whatever it is you’re designing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stylescapes open the door to a collusion of ideas, giving you and your client the chance to collaborate and communicate clearly and effectively. Your client can point to a specific element or an entire Stylescape and tell you, with zero hesitation, whether they like it or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than continue to guess what their words and ideas look like, you can find certain images, colors, or typefaces that visually represent what they’re thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can bridge the gap between what they say versus what they mean, get them to see what you see, and jump into the design process with more confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get Approval Before You Start Working&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of that crystal-clear confirmation that you and your client are on the same page, you also get the added bonus of a verbal sign-off. When your client points to a Stylescape and confidently says, “that’s the direction I want to go in,” that’s your green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too often designers try to read their client’s minds. They don’t always get a full ‘yes’ to move forward, which then sets the course for an endless cycle of revisions, headaches, and lost time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s clear something up: we’re not saying clients dictate the design process. It’s quite the contrary. Like we mentioned before, clients want to be involved. They want to make sure their needs and concerns are heard, and the best way to do that is to give them the opportunity to voice their opinions. When your process is more transparent, clients trust your open-door approach more easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you show clients a few samples of what the final design could look like, it only gets them more excited to see the finished product. By using Stylescapes, you get design approval faster, more clearly, and with more confidence—before you design anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5e7bd58eb1d9e9303e7428ad_MetTel_Stylescape_girl.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Bright, colorful example brand identity stylescape.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See the Difference Stylescapes Can Make&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine knowing exactly what your clients wanted, or having little to no friction when you shared your ideas. Or dodging extra work, staying on task and within the scope. Imagine getting to do what you love without anyone stepping on your toes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stylescapes make all of this possible. They fill that gap between the creative brief and the design work where information gets lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of disconnecting from your client and losing sight of the project, you work together to find the ideal solution. Without that visual reference, you slowly but surely start relying on your client or boss to tell you what to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to keep you from running back and forth from the drawing board. Speaking from our experience, becoming your client’s puppet is pretty soul-crushing. And as a designer, you never want to feel like you can’t do your job well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Design Projects Can Be More Profitable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Realistically speaking, clients won’t always look at a Stylescape and say, “that’s the one.” Creating Stylescapes is only one little slice of the whole pie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because not only do you have to turn your client’s thoughts into visual references, you also have to present them in a way that gets you that buy-in. You have to be able to sell them on a vision—to paint a narrative that prompts them to pick a certain direction they can feel good about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And our &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/course/stylescapes&#34;&gt;Stylescapes course&lt;/a&gt; teaches you all of this and more. It’s designed to train you to stop guessing what clients want, present ideas with confidence, and establish a repeatable process that guarantees success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You won’t just learn to create Stylescapes that look great, but you’ll also learn how to make them work. With the downloadable resources and presentation templates, you’ll learn how to vividly describe your visual concepts in a way that gets your clients on board in no time. Instead of waiting weeks to get aligned, you can do it almost instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Stylescapes course includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Over 6 hours of video content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design and presentation templates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Access to a private Slack channel&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Email scripts and templates&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Real client presentation videos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Practice assignments&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that’s not even all of it. You’ll have Chris as your temporary Creative Director, showing you the ropes to master the Stylescape process, from creation to nailing your presentations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can simplify your design projects, strengthen your relationship with your clients, and have a proven method that works successfully every time.

Incorporating Stylescapes into your creative process is the first step to landing more rewarding work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Endless revisions, last-minute tweaks, losing your creative freedom, or dragging projects beyond the scope can become a thing of the past. You and your clients can forget about clashing over the design direction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you include the use of Stylescapes into your projects, you’ll have a proven process that helps you nail your client’s expectations on the mark, get design approval fast, and demonstrate your capabilities as a design professional.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Stylescapes, you’ll change the way you work, forever.

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the globe, we’ve all been asked to do our part to help contain the spread of COVID-19. Social distancing, self-quarantining, and self-isolation are just a few of the terms floating around to remind us to stay inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still pretty uncertain when our lives will return ‘back to normal,’ and until that day comes, we have to hunker down, stay home, and patiently wait for this quarantine to be over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So to help make all this time spent at home a little easier, we’ve assembled the ultimate guide to self-quarantining. It contains ideas to keep you inspired, informed, productive, creative, and most importantly, &lt;em&gt;not bored&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get The Facts First&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updates regarding COVID-19 seem to change by the minute, so it’s important to stay in the loop of what’s happening. You don’t want to miss any critical information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html&#34;&gt;Follow CDC guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and check for updates on prevention and treatment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1&#34;&gt;Follow the World Health Organization (WHO)&lt;/a&gt; for reports and all information on the outbreak.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DrDenaGrayson&#34;&gt;Follow Dr. Dena Grayson, MD, PhD. on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to get all of your questions answered regarding COVID-19.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus#tab=tab_1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5e7944e255439d68007255a9_logo-who.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Learn more about COVID-19 updates from the WHO.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Tools for Working from Home&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re adjusting to working from home, it helps to have a few tools to keep you productive and in communication with your team.

Social distancing, self-quarantining, and self-isolation are just a few of the terms floating around to remind us to stay inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s still pretty uncertain when our lives will return ‘back to normal,’ and until that day comes, we have to hunker down, stay home, and patiently wait for this quarantine to be over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So to help make all this time spent at home a little easier, we’ve assembled the ultimate guide to self-quarantining. It contains ideas to keep you inspired, informed, productive, creative, and most importantly, &lt;em&gt;not bored&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get The Facts First&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Updates regarding COVID-19 seem to change by the minute, so it’s important to stay in the loop of what’s happening.

It’s the understanding a customer has about your business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mind behind this branding mantra, Marty Neumeier, is what you’d call an expert when it comes to branding. He’s written several books on the subject, consulted with businesses around the globe, and has led countless creatives and strategists alike to build better brands—including us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On February 27th &amp;amp; 28th, we had Marty at our HQ to host a branding masterclass and workshop. The 2-day event challenged us break down branding to its fundamentals, and construct a disruptive brand in a matter of hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how the masterclass went:&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking Down Branding: Day One&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A total of 65 participants shuffled into The Futur HQ equipped with notebooks, laptops, and a thirst for new knowledge. The workshop kicked off with a deep dive of modern brand-building disciplines, definitions, and methods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a fresh dose of branding knowledge, the group was ready for the next challenge: building a meaningful and impactful brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teams were broken into groups of 6 and were tasked to come up with a new brand, pitch, and website prototype for a hypothetical business. With the clock working against them, teams had until the end of the day to build a unique and innovative brand that broke from the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To close the first day, groups went up one by one to present their concepts and receive on-the-spot feedback from Marty. Teams were challenged to take their ideas one step further with each critique.&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5e6aaec70324519e04fbbe9a_branding%20masterclass%20(23%20of%2071).jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A designer shares his brand identity concept with workshop participants.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dirty &amp;amp; Certified: Day Two&lt;/strong&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To wrap up the second and final day of the workshop, teams presented each customer touchpoint for their brands. One group was crowned the winner for their fun, clever and disruptive grocery brand: The Dirty Market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the workshop complete, the attendees put their skills to the test once more with a certification exam, and all 65 of them happily walked out as certified Brand Specialists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5e6ab4d3df941bcd79ff9e03_branding%20masterclass%20(62%20of%2071).jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Marty Neumeier poses with the winning team from the branding workshop.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marty’s masterclass brought an exciting and rewarding couple of days to everyone.

    <title>We Crashed a College Course to Teach Typography 01</title>
    <updated>2020-02-18T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, for a select group of students at the School of Visual Arts (SVA) in NYC, that’s exactly what happened. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, Jan. 25th, masters students from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://productsofdesign.sva.edu/&#34;&gt;Products of Design&lt;/a&gt; program had the opportunity to join a virtual classroom with Chris and take the Typography 01 course alongside him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Chris phoned in from Santa Monica, SVA students huddled into the classroom for a watch party of the course, followed by a practice session, live critique, and deeper instruction on the material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This pilot program introduced a course outside of the school’s curriculum in a new and engaging way—without cutting into students’ tuition, schedules, or the university’s budget. In just one day, students turned an unfamiliar concept into a skill they can incorporate into everything they create going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Products of Design program at SVA focuses on three main fields: making (physical designs), structures, and storytelling. So…why did we teach Typography?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re new around here, you know that Typography is essentially one of our secret sauces. It’s a design fundamental that, to us, is absolutely crucial to learn, understand, and implement into our work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything about Typography’s roots—contrast, scale, composition, repetition—impacts every facet of design. Applying the fundamentals of type into our work definitely raised it to a higher caliber, and we firmly believe it can do the same for designers of any industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rules of type are complementary to the three fields of the masters program: physical design, design systems, and storytelling and communication. Typography is just one more tool the students can add to their belts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who participated had some really awesome things to say at the end of the day:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Typography, generally, is where I feel the most creative block and anxiety in my design practice. Your master class felt conversational and engaging in a way that made it feel approachable and fun. Seeing the ‘live&amp;#39; corrections really helped me see what a stronger use of typography and layout actually looks like in a process-based environment.” — SVA student, Stephanie Gamble&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new, interactive classroom setup was a first for us, and most definitely not our last. Our eyes are still set on impacting 1 billion creatives around the world, and we’re excited for more opportunities like this to further design education for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you to the Products of Design School for having us!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo credit: The School of Visual Arts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Want to see us in class?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Send an email to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:support@thefutur.com&#34;&gt;support@thefutur.com&lt;/a&gt; and tell us about your school/program, what course you’d like us to teach, and a few dates that’ll work with your class schedule.

    <title>What Matters More, Quality or Quantity?</title>
    <updated>2020-02-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2020-02-07:/blog/what-matters-more-quality-or-quantity</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Matters More, Quality or Quantity?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;More and more each day, we’re figuring out just how important it is to be active online. And not just logged in and commenting on people’s posts, but actually contributing with original content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content marketing has allowed us to leverage our social platforms. We’re able to market ourselves and our business in some pretty awesome and engaging ways. But when it comes to the content, what about it makes the most impact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want to make impressions and connections online, what matters more: the quality or the quantity of our content?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Perils of Perfection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As creatives, we all have a slight case of perfectionism. Why wouldn’t we? We’re bred to impress clients with our work, and continuously improve our skills. It’s only natural for us to want our content to be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so we keep refining…and refining… and refining until we have the perfect post for Instagram. But then half of our day gets wasted making just one post. When you strive for utmost perfection, it can actually set you back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you want to label as perfect is not up to you. Once you post something, it’s up to your audience to determine that. Let them decide if your post is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Forget About Tradition&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tradition would likely have you believe that the quality of what you create is what matters most. Well, let’s scrap that for a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say you continue to make these “perfect posts” for Instagram, and lose half of your productivity in the process. Does that seem worth the time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if, instead of spending six hours creating a post, you trim it down to two—maybe even one hour. You can laser-focus in on what you want to publish, and reclaim your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on just getting the content out there, and let the chips fall where they may. The quality will always be baked in there, regardless of what you’re posting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The More You Make, the More You Learn&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice we didn’t say ‘earn.’ Sure, the opportunity to reel in prospects online is likely, but let’s focus on what you can potentially gain from sharing more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will only learn by putting yourself out there, experimenting, making a few mistakes, and trying again. Consistency is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more you iterate on something, the more it sticks in your brain. You’ll be pressed to find other pieces of information to back up or expand on your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you start posting more frequently, you will engage your audience. You’ll get to interact with them, build connections, and eventually, establish a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to posting content online, we’re quick to assume that quality breeds the most success. But when we get down to it, it’s really the quantity that makes the most impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on how much content you&amp;#39;re putting out there.

    <title>What Matters More, Quality or Quantity?</title>
    <updated>2020-02-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2020-02-07:/blog/what-matters-more-quality-or-quantity</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h3&gt;What Matters More, Quality or Quantity?&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;More and more each day, we’re figuring out just how important it is to be active online. And not just logged in and commenting on people’s posts, but actually contributing with original content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Content marketing has allowed us to leverage our social platforms. We’re able to market ourselves and our business in some pretty awesome and engaging ways. But when it comes to the content, what about it makes the most impact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we want to make impressions and connections online, what matters more: the quality or the quantity of our content?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s dig in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Perils of Perfection&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As creatives, we all have a slight case of perfectionism. Why wouldn’t we? We’re bred to impress clients with our work, and continuously improve our skills. It’s only natural for us to want our content to be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And so we keep refining…and refining… and refining until we have the perfect post for Instagram. But then half of our day gets wasted making just one post. When you strive for utmost perfection, it can actually set you back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you want to label as perfect is not up to you. Once you post something, it’s up to your audience to determine that. Let them decide if your post is good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Forget About Tradition&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tradition would likely have you believe that the quality of what you create is what matters most. Well, let’s scrap that for a second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Say you continue to make these “perfect posts” for Instagram, and lose half of your productivity in the process. Does that seem worth the time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if, instead of spending six hours creating a post, you trim it down to two—maybe even one hour. You can laser-focus in on what you want to publish, and reclaim your productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on just getting the content out there, and let the chips fall where they may. The quality will always be baked in there, regardless of what you’re posting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The More You Make, the More You Learn&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice we didn’t say ‘earn.’ Sure, the opportunity to reel in prospects online is likely, but let’s focus on what you can potentially gain from sharing more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will only learn by putting yourself out there, experimenting, making a few mistakes, and trying again. Consistency is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more you iterate on something, the more it sticks in your brain. You’ll be pressed to find other pieces of information to back up or expand on your ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you start posting more frequently, you will engage your audience. You’ll get to interact with them, build connections, and eventually, establish a community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Final Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to posting content online, we’re quick to assume that quality breeds the most success. But when we get down to it, it’s really the quantity that makes the most impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on how much content you&amp;#39;re putting out there. Allow your audience to determine what&amp;#39;s good, and engage in conversation with them to learn why. You’ll make more connections, pick up some new tricks, and gain fresh, new ideas along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Want more?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch this video of Chris and PiXimperfect host Unmesh Dinda dissect quality vs. quantity at Adobe MAX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/GEAKZAa1kLI&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>Write a Web Design Brief to Keep Your Projects on Track</title>
    <updated>2019-11-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-11-22:/blog/write-web-design-brief-keep-on-track</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How to Write a Design Brief to Keep Your Web Design Projects on Track&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today more than ever, a strong website presence can help make or break a customer’s decision to choose one business over a competitor. When a client comes to you in need of a website, you’ll more than likely take on the project--even if you don’t know how to build one yourself, or have anyone on hand who does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there are countless web designers out there. But before you hire one and have them get to work, you’ll need to set up a design brief. By the end of this article, you’ll have a better idea of not only how to write a design brief, but also how to keep the project on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What is a Design Brief?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A design brief is a document written by the client that the web designer will use to estimate the amount of time required and the costs associated with a project. The client specifies all their wishes regarding the design and the various features that need to be added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the customer hasn’t fully envisioned the project. The brief allows them to record all their ideas in writing so everyone involved reaches a mutual understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Parts of a Design Brief&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;An effective design brief should contain information on the following topics:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The target demographics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Any features you want on the website&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What people can do on the site&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Language options&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Logos and color schemes&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What tone of voice should be used&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A brief example, or a similar website, and what to try to incorporate&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The budget and deadline&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Keeping the Target Demographics in Mind&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, sites fill a variety of niches, partly because there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.speedstartup.org/blog-post/importance-understanding-target-audience/&#34;&gt;so many different people&lt;/a&gt;. Are you building a site to market to a local audience, or are you trying to grow your brand and reach a larger group? Is the website intended for a younger generation, an older community, or a mix of the two?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the sort of questions you need to answer in your brief so the person completing the project knows what to do. For example, if you’re building a website for elderly adults to use, you would use a larger font, links embedded into anchor texts are visible to the user, and there shouldn’t be a large amount of background animation because it will be distracting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the exact opposite of what you would do with kids and teens, though. With younger people, you can use animations and use a variety of images. A good designer knows where the fine line is between stunning and cluttered. They would also use bright colors and play with the color scheme to make the site exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Functionality &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different sites will be capable of doing different things. However, all sites should share some things in common, such as social media plugins, a frequently asked questions tab, contact information, and a navigation tab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the site is marketing a product, then you should talk to the designer about adding a section for customer reviews. If the site is selling a product, then you need to communicate what forms of payment will be accepted on the website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re trying to build a launchpad or a news site, then communicate how you want the homepage to look. Should it be various tiles with the names of different articles, or should be it a list going down the page? Also, how should the site be organized? Continuing with the news site example, you may want to include a ribbon with different types of articles, like finance and style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Language Options&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regardless of where you live in the world, various groups of people will find their way to your site; it’s important to keep that in mind while writing the brief. Some websites are now including different flags above the navigation ribbon or acronyms of various countries to allow users to translate a website without having to use external software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By including this feature on your site, the content is more accessible, prompting people to stay on the website longer. If they stay on longer, they’re more likely to browse other sections of the site, or shop around depending on if the site is designed to inform or facilitate commerce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Use of Logos and Complementary Color Schemes&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note this one because a beautiful site could be the difference between someone staying on it or going to a competitor’s website. If using a logo, think about that logo, and communicate with the designer that you want to use a similar color scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your logo and color scheme don’t complement one another, it creates a sense of disjointedness that will make people shy away from your site. Specifying a color palette in the brief will help avoid this entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Use of Tone and Style&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This element is important not necessarily for the aesthetic value of the website, but &lt;a href=&#34;https://3to5marketing.com/freelance-writing-beginners/&#34;&gt;its readability&lt;/a&gt;. The tone is dependent on two things: the audience and the mood. The way you would write for an adult would be different than how you would address a toddler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Play around with what words you would use and the order you can communicate the same thing to different people using two different sentences. When building a website that has a young target audience, you’ll have to create shorter sentences and be more direct with what you’re saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas tone is what you’re saying, style is how you say it. Let’s say your website is geared more towards professionals in a certain field. You wouldn’t use exclamation marks or contractions as often as you would in a more casual piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is because using contractions helps free up the language. The use of &lt;em&gt;it’s&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;it is&lt;/em&gt;, for example, makes a website seem less rigid. A website will have one of four general styles it’s written in: expository, descriptive, narrative, or persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many tools and services online like &lt;a href=&#34;http://writingjudge.com/&#34;&gt;WritingJudge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://grammarly.com&#34;&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trustmypaper.com/&#34;&gt;TrustMyPaper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bestessay.education/&#34;&gt;BestEssay.Education&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://hemingwayapp.com&#34;&gt;Hemingway&lt;/a&gt; that can help you calibrate the tone and voice of your copy to the needs of your target audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communicating the style to the web designer will also help them build a background that complements the content written on your website. Style can also refer to the layout itself. Think about elements that you like from outside inspiration and try to have those things incorporated into the website design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scandinavian design, for example, focuses on simplicity, minimalism, and functionally. Its use of sharp lines and a neutral palette gives a clean look to any home, and if these same concepts are applied to the web design process, it creates a sleek and elegant looking site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Examples of Websites and Why They’re Designed Well&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are going to focus on two different websites, and what each one did well. There’s the social media titan, Facebook, and the sports website, ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An excellent example of the concept of the use of designing websites with complementary color schemes to their logo is Facebook. Facebook’s logo has a white letter on a blue background. The pane at the top of the page is blue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the interface seems cluttered, however, upon closer inspection, the design team did an excellent job of incorporating white space to break up various sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.espn.com/&#34;&gt;ESPN’s website&lt;/a&gt; also has a lot going on, but everything works well together. You have articles you can read and scores you can check, but there’s also background videos playing to keep you informed on a variety of topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This site also makes use of smooth transitions, keeping the UI clean. Above the navigation ribbon are scores from a variety of sports, along with a plugin for a variety of fantasy sports leagues. This makes ESPN’s site a one-stop-shop for anything sports-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Communicating Deadlines &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of all of the sections in this article, deadlines may be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/want-to-show-great-leadership-skills-as-deadline-approaches-try-these-5-communic.html&#34;&gt;hardest to communicate&lt;/a&gt;. Life happens, and the web designer may be attempting to juggle multiple projects. Because of this, deadlines may not be met. Rather than say the project is due a month from now, say you would like to see progress checks every Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows you to see the site as it evolves. By breaking it up into smaller tasks, you can address something you don’t like right during the check-ins, rather than the designer have to tweak their final product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to contact the web designer. It’s better to reach out a week before the deadline and find out that the site will be completed late, rather than learning this the day after the due date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Budget&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There should be two parts of the budget: the cost of the website, and the fee associated with reimbursing the designer for their time. As a general rule, the more detailed a website is, the more you’ll pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more experience someone brings to designing a project, the more their services will cost, but that’s because they&amp;#39;ll be able to deliver a better product.” — Diana Adjadj, freelance UX writer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://studicus.com/&#34;&gt;Studicus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Final Thoughts on Web Design Briefs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a brief is a time-consuming process, but a necessary one. When you clearly communicate your ideas and goals with the designer, you not only give them an idea of what they’re supposed to build, but you also gain an unbiased sounding board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This becomes useful when you are talking through what you want to accomplish, and they’re able to give feedback or ask questions that you may have missed. As long as the designer stays on brief and budget, you’re sure to have a website that doesn’t just meet your needs, but exceeds them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristin Savage is an English Literature graduate who is interested in writing and planning to publish her own book in the near future. She graduated last year but is already a true expert when it comes to presenting a text in a creative and understandable manner, this is why she’s a senior editor at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grabmyessay.com/buy-research-paper&#34;&gt;Grab My Essay&lt;/a&gt;, and a regular contributor at &lt;a href=&#34;https://wowgrade.net/&#34;&gt;WoWGrade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://supremedissertations.com/&#34;&gt;Supreme Dissertations&lt;/a&gt;. The texts Kristin writes are always informative, based on qualitative research but nevertheless pleasant to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

When building a website that has a young target audience, you’ll have to create shorter sentences and be more direct with what you’re saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas tone is what you’re saying, style is how you say it. Let’s say your website is geared more towards professionals in a certain field. You wouldn’t use exclamation marks or contractions as often as you would in a more casual piece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is because using contractions helps free up the language. The use of &lt;em&gt;it’s&lt;/em&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;it is&lt;/em&gt;, for example, makes a website seem less rigid. A website will have one of four general styles it’s written in: expository, descriptive, narrative, or persuasive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many tools and services online like &lt;a href=&#34;http://writingjudge.com/&#34;&gt;WritingJudge&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://grammarly.com&#34;&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trustmypaper.com/&#34;&gt;TrustMyPaper&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://bestessay.education/&#34;&gt;BestEssay.Education&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://hemingwayapp.com&#34;&gt;Hemingway&lt;/a&gt; that can help you calibrate the tone and voice of your copy to the needs of your target audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communicating the style to the web designer will also help them build a background that complements the content written on your website. Style can also refer to the layout itself. Think about elements that you like from outside inspiration and try to have those things incorporated into the website design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scandinavian design, for example, focuses on simplicity, minimalism, and functionally. Its use of sharp lines and a neutral palette gives a clean look to any home, and if these same concepts are applied to the web design process, it creates a sleek and elegant looking site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Examples of Websites and Why They’re Designed Well&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are going to focus on two different websites, and what each one did well. There’s the social media titan, Facebook, and the sports website, ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An excellent example of the concept of the use of designing websites with complementary color schemes to their logo is Facebook. Facebook’s logo has a white letter on a blue background. The pane at the top of the page is blue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the interface seems cluttered, however, upon closer inspection, the design team did an excellent job of incorporating white space to break up various sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.espn.com/&#34;&gt;ESPN’s website&lt;/a&gt; also has a lot going on, but everything works well together. You have articles you can read and scores you can check, but there’s also background videos playing to keep you informed on a variety of topics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This site also makes use of smooth transitions, keeping the UI clean. Above the navigation ribbon are scores from a variety of sports, along with a plugin for a variety of fantasy sports leagues. This makes ESPN’s site a one-stop-shop for anything sports-related.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Communicating Deadlines &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of all of the sections in this article, deadlines may be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inc.com/marcel-schwantes/want-to-show-great-leadership-skills-as-deadline-approaches-try-these-5-communic.html&#34;&gt;hardest to communicate&lt;/a&gt;. Life happens, and the web designer may be attempting to juggle multiple projects. Because of this, deadlines may not be met. Rather than say the project is due a month from now, say you would like to see progress checks every Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows you to see the site as it evolves. By breaking it up into smaller tasks, you can address something you don’t like right during the check-ins, rather than the designer have to tweak their final product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to contact the web designer. It’s better to reach out a week before the deadline and find out that the site will be completed late, rather than learning this the day after the due date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Budget&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There should be two parts of the budget: the cost of the website, and the fee associated with reimbursing the designer for their time. As a general rule, the more detailed a website is, the more you’ll pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The more experience someone brings to designing a project, the more their services will cost, but that’s because they&amp;#39;ll be able to deliver a better product.” — Diana Adjadj, freelance UX writer at &lt;a href=&#34;https://studicus.com/&#34;&gt;Studicus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Final Thoughts on Web Design Briefs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing a brief is a time-consuming process, but a necessary one. When you clearly communicate your ideas and goals with the designer, you not only give them an idea of what they’re supposed to build, but you also gain an unbiased sounding board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This becomes useful when you are talking through what you want to accomplish, and they’re able to give feedback or ask questions that you may have missed. As long as the designer stays on brief and budget, you’re sure to have a website that doesn’t just meet your needs, but exceeds them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kristin Savage is an English Literature graduate who is interested in writing and planning to publish her own book in the near future. She graduated last year but is already a true expert when it comes to presenting a text in a creative and understandable manner, this is why she’s a senior editor at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.grabmyessay.com/buy-research-paper&#34;&gt;Grab My Essay&lt;/a&gt;, and a regular contributor at &lt;a href=&#34;https://wowgrade.net/&#34;&gt;WoWGrade&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://supremedissertations.com/&#34;&gt;Supreme Dissertations&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>How CORE can help you charge over $10k for discovery</title>
    <updated>2019-11-05T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-11-05:/blog/how-core-helps-you-charge-more</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;David charges a flat $10k (plus hotel and airfare) for a 1-day consultation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was blown away for two reasons. One: Fabian had agreed to do this without any guarantees. Two: someone was able to earn $10k for one day’s work—what!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I became obsessed with hitting that benchmark as a personal challenge. What would I have to do for someone to see me as worth that amount?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast forward, I met Jose and learned about CORE. I thought to myself, this is it. This was the framework I needed to solve big problems for prospective clients (things like marketing, revenue, operations, creating an internal culture, and brand) and start landing higher-paying projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Some details to note:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The person who authored the CORE framework, Jose, was the one who taught me. The first time I ever saw it was during a real client meeting with Trojan Storage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I quickly saw the benefits of CORE as it applied to branding. For the first time in my life, I saw a direct connection between the craft and the strategy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The idea of becoming an agency (offering advertising, marketing, and branding) seemed like an impossible dream. Now, it was within sight. Of course, the framework, originally conceived to tackle UX and digital product design, would need to be modified to suit my needs.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Patience perseveres.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next year, I tried to offer discovery (really, CORE) to many entrepreneurs. Though a lot of them were interested, they either couldn’t afford it or just didn’t see the value. Having seen it firsthand, I knew I would be able to deliver in excess of the $10k they would need to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While waiting for the right client, Jose and I ran a CORE workshop. I focused on user profiles, and Jose handled the brand attributes and the goals/prioritization exercises. Jose had remarked that for someone new to this, I was really good at doing CORE and teaching. Turns out, my 15 years teaching design students and dealing with commercial clients was more than enough “training” and preparation to be a facilitator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I found a client. And, I changed the discovery price from $10k to $30k. How did I get to that number? If I hadn’t been able to sell it for $10k, why did I increase the price by 3x?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;If you want better clients, you have to charge more.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project was a little daunting as the C-suite executives flew from the east coast for a 2-day session just to work with us. I had hired Jose to help me facilitate the session as a safety net. At the end of day one, I had everyone from the CEO, CRO, CMO and CTO giving me hugs. They all felt a sense of validation. Their needs were heard by their respective team. I also helped them “discover” why they weren’t gaining traction with their customers. This was worth the entire price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The engagement started at $100k and blew up to over $250k as the scope grew. Again, you might be in disbelief that someone who had never sold strategy, let alone do it, was able to sell an engagement of this size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we moved into creating deliverables for the client, Jose and I ran our second CORE workshop at our office. I was now teaching the framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The best way to master something is to teach it.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few years later, and over a dozen paid discovery sessions, we’ve been able to charge over $100k for discovery alone (thanks in large part to the negotiation skills of Ben Burns).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By my account, CORE, had fundamentally changed me, my business, my client’s business, and all the students we’ve taught. It was the catalyst that sparked all the change you all are now a part of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How CORE helps&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;CORE is a UX strategy framework. It has components that help you define the brand and write a positioning statement. If done properly, it can produce actionable insights, and at the least, give you (the creative) an opportunity to be more than an “order taker” to the key decision-makers. Like many things, it’s a tool. The tool is a reflection of the person who uses it. Nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;CORE is an open framework&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s encouraged that you adapt it for your specific needs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s not a shortcut&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It’s not magic, but the results can be magical&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are some outdated examples that are included (but do not materially affect how you use it)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are some errors, omissions and typos (again, should not impact you on any real level)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jose is the author. I contributed to it, but I am not the author.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The framework I use resembles CORE but is not the same thing&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;CORE will not produce anything. It wasn’t designed to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hope this clears up a few things. If you made it this far, I have a few words of wisdom for you: don’t overpromise something you can’t deliver. You don’t need the extra pressure. If you are over your head, reach out and ask for help.

    <title>Essential Marketing Channels For Small Businesses</title>
    <updated>2019-10-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-10-29:/blog/marketing-channels-small-businesses</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a process where you communicate, attract and convince consumers that what you offer is of value to them. It involves research, promoting, selling and distributing your products or services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without marketing, a lot of businesses would fail. Even with a great product or service, if consumers don&amp;#39;t know and understand its value, no sales will be made. At the end of the day, you want to grow as much &amp;amp; as fast as you can, which is impossible without pulling your efforts into marketing at some point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a small business, you will want to find the most inexpensive ways to achieve your marketing goals. There are a number of marketing channels that can achieve this – some are even free. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are six marketing channels that can help you market your business at a low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5db8b74ff321ef09bacae733_0Bjc-p75wQ4zfi8GNVXPO14ClaYyyD9kFSiJvvzIa3ikaVsgD8UUlM3CSL5wY8PFXE6wiQUMLOhWFiwlQPxer0ZNQBCZuYkofn8ttauek-Gtyh-S9RzIBlL1tk_eOTNxsfS6y-c.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Define your inbound marketing strategy to know which channels to utilize.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Business Website&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a business website and paying for good hosting is a great way to market your business. A business website can be used as a tool to grow your image and communicate your business’ message.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use a website as an online store where customers can make purchases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most people want to know about a business or its products, the first thing they do is go to a search engine. What they find from their search shapes their image of the business and influences their decision to purchase your product or service. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/the-changing-face-b2b-marketing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;According to Google&lt;/a&gt;, 89% of Business to Business buyers and 81% of online shoppers use search engines to know more about new products and services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone searches for something that is related to your business, you want your website to be on the top search results and be easily found by the consumer. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) can help you with this. SEO is a measurable, trusted process that is used to send data to search engines that your website is worth showing in their index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By having good SEO for your website, you will get the best out of this marketing channel resulting in a respected, well-known brand and high sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Blogs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blogs have become a powerful marketing channel. A business blog is a stand-alone web page or part of an existing business website. It is specifically assigned to writing about materials relating to the business’ industry or its subfields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to bring more customers to your business is by giving them new, original content on a regular basis. A good business blog should have well-researched, thought-provoking blog posts that are also SEO optimized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#39;s good to have a blog that has great content, it is also important that your business is featured on other blogs with links to your business website. You should try to your businesses reach to both fellow bloggers and customers while also increasing your SEO grading.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blogging also creates one of the easiest, fast and direct ways of communicating with consumers. You are able to tell them about your business and ask them to give feedback and opinions. You can use this information to research your customer&amp;#39;s needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blogs also act as customer channels that can be used to communicate with the target market about the business’ value proposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No need to say: every entrepreneur should know &lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/blogging-for-creative-entrepreneurs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;how to blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Social Media&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2.7 billion social media users&lt;/a&gt; across the globe, social media marketing can be said to be the largest and most powerful marketing channel. Social media marketing involves creating and sharing content on social media to achieve your business’s marketing goals. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media marketing involves posting text and image updates, videos and other content to encourage audience engagement. With the high number of social media platforms, it is also important to carefully choose which ones to use based on your target market.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A social media presence makes your business more accessible and customers in the loop about your business. It also enables you to respond in real time to issues and conversations. Social media can be used for customer service, suggestions and complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some social media platforms like YouTube have dedicated business channels that your business can use to reach customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Email Marketing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email marketing is the most direct, low cost and effective way of connecting with potential customers, nurturing them and converting them into customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email marketing helps grow and sustain a relationship with the customers by regular sharing of valuable information. Most importantly email marketing allows the business to have complete control over the content the customers get, which allows for custom messaging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Email marketing acts as a channel of communication between the customer and the business to share information relating to the product or service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Local marketing&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local marketing is simply a marketing channel that involves marketing your business to a nearby audience or the community that you operate in. This kind of marketing is usually used by small businesses such as stores, restaurants and local outlets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5db8b7797d580191ba7ad135_YZfVy_-cDZSUELa3u6wnG1_pD3ZMOQi_YCXcF6yRx2-0AGwDa2Mf18fZSTIbOJEsdrfITglBxfpCcuc09FUK-3JxmanocmwAPfaqF4xIjn3wP-LA2_Gg_R0TIUZoBx_sxQBXLd4.png&#34; alt=&#34;Person pointing to point on a map and finding direction.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When people go online to search for a product related to your business, their results are usually focused around their location. Local marketing helps your business be readily available to the people near to you.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local marketing can come as direct contact with consumers via mail, local town events or local sports team sponsorship. This allows a business to develop a repeat consumer base in the immediate surrounding area of the business’ location.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger businesses with a number of locations can use local marketing to reach their local target markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;6. Word of Mouth&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word of mouth marketing (WOMM) is when a consumers interest in a business is reflected in their everyday dialog with other people.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2012/consumer-trust-in-online-social-and-mobile-advertising-grows.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;92% of consumers&lt;/a&gt; believe suggestions from family and friends more than they do advertising. This is a huge reason to rely on your customers to recommend your business to others.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People tend to have more trust in customers compared to marketers. They believe marketers have an agenda, which is to say anything to promote their business to generate more sales.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be able to generate word of mouth marketing, you will have to provide the best product or service possible accompanied by excellent customer service. Only after satisfying the needs of your customer and turning them into loyal and passionate followers will they recommend your business to family and friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Which Marketing Channels Will You Use?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of marketing channel you pick will depend on your needs and budget. However, it is recommended to try as many as you can to increase your chances of success.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, nowadays time is the most expensive commodity for anyone, so it’s completely reasonable to focus on what matters the most &amp;amp; not waste most of your week/month testing out every marketing channel out there. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having said that, the biggest must-have marketing channel out the ones mentioned above is the business website. After you’ve set-up your website, you can use the other marketing channels, such as social media, blog and word of mouth to compliment it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All of marketing channels mentioned in this article are the best way of reaching customers, especially if you’re in design business industry.

    <title>Essential Marketing Channels For Small Businesses</title>
    <updated>2019-10-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-10-29:/blog/marketing-channels-small-businesses</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a process where you communicate, attract and convince consumers that what you offer is of value to them. It involves research, promoting, selling and distributing your products or services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Without marketing, a lot of businesses would fail. Even with a great product or service, if consumers don&amp;#39;t know and understand its value, no sales will be made. At the end of the day, you want to grow as much &amp;amp; as fast as you can, which is impossible without pulling your efforts into marketing at some point.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a small business, you will want to find the most inexpensive ways to achieve your marketing goals. There are a number of marketing channels that can achieve this – some are even free. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are six marketing channels that can help you market your business at a low cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5db8b74ff321ef09bacae733_0Bjc-p75wQ4zfi8GNVXPO14ClaYyyD9kFSiJvvzIa3ikaVsgD8UUlM3CSL5wY8PFXE6wiQUMLOhWFiwlQPxer0ZNQBCZuYkofn8ttauek-Gtyh-S9RzIBlL1tk_eOTNxsfS6y-c.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Define your inbound marketing strategy to know which channels to utilize.&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Business Website&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a business website and paying for good hosting is a great way to market your business. A business website can be used as a tool to grow your image and communicate your business’ message.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also use a website as an online store where customers can make purchases. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When most people want to know about a business or its products, the first thing they do is go to a search engine. What they find from their search shapes their image of the business and influences their decision to purchase your product or service. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/the-changing-face-b2b-marketing/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;According to Google&lt;/a&gt;, 89% of Business to Business buyers and 81% of online shoppers use search engines to know more about new products and services.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When someone searches for something that is related to your business, you want your website to be on the top search results and be easily found by the consumer. Search Engine Optimization (SEO) can help you with this. SEO is a measurable, trusted process that is used to send data to search engines that your website is worth showing in their index.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By having good SEO for your website, you will get the best out of this marketing channel resulting in a respected, well-known brand and high sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Blogs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blogs have become a powerful marketing channel. A business blog is a stand-alone web page or part of an existing business website. It is specifically assigned to writing about materials relating to the business’ industry or its subfields. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the best ways to bring more customers to your business is by giving them new, original content on a regular basis. A good business blog should have well-researched, thought-provoking blog posts that are also SEO optimized.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#39;s good to have a blog that has great content, it is also important that your business is featured on other blogs with links to your business website.

You can use this information to research your customer&amp;#39;s needs.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blogs also act as customer channels that can be used to communicate with the target market about the business’ value proposition.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No need to say: every entrepreneur should know &lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/blogging-for-creative-entrepreneurs&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;how to blog&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Social Media&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With over &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.statista.com/statistics/278414/number-of-worldwide-social-network-users/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;2.7 billion social media users&lt;/a&gt; across the globe, social media marketing can be said to be the largest and most powerful marketing channel.

    <title>The Art of Deconstruction</title>
    <updated>2019-09-18T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-09-18:/blog/art-deconstruction-reverse-engineer-success</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Art of Deconstruction&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a creative professional for over 15 years working in branding, advertising, and design. With every project I’ve been a part of, I’m presented with new challenges I’ve never faced before. Needless to say, creative problem-solving has been the most common theme of my career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable approaches to my work has been The Art of Deconstruction. This method helps me rapidly develop new skills and techniques to meet the demand of just about anything; like this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewencina.com/coldplay-ink&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;interactive music video I created for Coldplay&lt;/a&gt;, or this &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/JFqiSr9A-Go&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;viral video I made on YouTube that’s amassed over 3 million views&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I share the above two examples not to flex, but to tell you that I didn’t have the tools or knowledge before I started those projects. Instead, I had a meticulous approach to dissecting similar examples out there and applying what I learned directly to my work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In short: I figured it out&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goal in this article is to share this process with you so you can develop your analytical lens to break down, understand, and learn from the success of others before you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the Art of Deconstruction in 5 Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Identify the goal&lt;br/&gt;2. Research the subject and platform&lt;br/&gt;3. Deconstruct, Analyze, &amp;amp; Understand&lt;br/&gt;4. Emulate &amp;amp; Apply&lt;br/&gt;5. Improve Upon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Identify Your Goal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you want to do? It’s very important to identify your goal before you start anything. (I talk all about this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thefutur.com/great-kickoff-meeting-design-anything/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in another article.&lt;/a&gt;) This will help you hyper-focus, save time, and give you a clear filter to help you evaluate your efforts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are a Few Examples of Goals: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take great portrait photos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paint like an Impressionist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remodel my home office&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give a presentation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Research&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the top performers or best examples on a subject and particular platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who else has done this before?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you like?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does everyone else like?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What metrics are valuable to measure?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done a deep dive and can pick up on trends and patterns, select the cream of the crop. Pick the top 3-5 examples and include at least one anomaly—the example that performs as well as the rest, but breaks the common threads that link the others together. Anomalies will help to challenge the conclusions you might have from your findings to help you form a better hypothesis moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Deconstruct, Analyze, &amp;amp; Understand&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve gone to art school, you might be familiar with the “masterwork copy” assignment. You take a popular piece of art and simply copy it. Stroke by stroke. Color to color. The purpose is to help students develop their skills quickly by understanding how the masters made such great pieces of art. Through this process, they train their eyes on how to see and their hands how to make. Students add new tools to their toolbox as they solve the challenges of their own work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Whenever I Seek To Understand The Success Of Something, I Ask Myself A Few Questions:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the main components and ingredients that make this up?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What specific attributes make it effective?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did the person make it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How would you go about making that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;If We Were To Apply This Line Of Questioning To A Van Gogh Painting, You Might Analyze It This Way:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The main components that make this up:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;the subject, Van Gogh, slightly off-center of the frame. He’s facing us 3/4 and is lit with a single key light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes it effective (beautiful):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;its organized rhythmic brush strokes, subtle muted split-complementary color palette, and high contrast at its focal point: his eyes and expression.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did he make it:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Using oil paints, Van Gogh created his self-portrait using repeating patterns of brushstrokes that follow the contours of the shapes of the subject.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Become A Reverse Engineer&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to reverse engineer something is one of the most effective ways to understand how great things are made and why they work. This is The Art of Deconstruction and can be applied to anything:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;A dish from a Michelin star restaurant can be broken down into raw ingredients, seasoning, and cooking techniques.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When studying a successful business, you can research their industry, the need they fill for their consumers, and their perceived brand in the marketplace.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;With a beautiful website, you can take note of the colors, typography, and hierarchy. You can even open the page source, and see every line of code it took to build it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When watching a film, you can break down the story arc, its characters, themes, cinematography, visual effects, and editing style.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For comedy, you can analyze a standup artist’s jokes: their stories, cadence, and method of delivery.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d9248a707aa1da421b07a26_800px-Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Self-Portrait_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Self-Portrait, September 1889.

Emulate &amp;amp; Apply&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you can decode the ingredients that makeup something great, you demystify its genius into elements you can understand. From there, you can begin to emulate and adopt these pieces into your own work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fully understand how something works, try to copy it. Just like the Masterwork assignment I mentioned, use each ingredient and follow each step until you’ve recreated one part or all of the work you’re studying. Based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.educationcorner.com/the-learning-pyramid.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;learning retention pyramid&lt;/a&gt;, this method of active learning will help you cement the information for you to use later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“Isn’t that stealing?” – Every Creative Person&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, some of you might feel a little apprehensive towards this. Watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/nJPERZDfyWc&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;“Everything is a Remix”&lt;/a&gt;, then I’ll meet you back here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Improve Upon&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t just take from culture; contribute to it. The last step of this process is to apply your newfound knowledge towards the goal you’ve identified in step 1. Take the most relevant elements of the best things you’ve consumed and improve them. Combine them together. Make something new built off of what came before you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Here Are A Couple Of Ways To Do That:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add your POV. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s your unique perspective on the subject matter? What can you add to the conversation?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remix it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“This meets that”. “It’s the Uber for…”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go more in-depth.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you’ve found an article that’s 2000 words on how to tidy up, then write an article that’s 5000 words and get into the nuances of organizing and color-coding your shirts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find the white space. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What aren’t they doing?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Prove It. Show Me.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this article, I shared a link to a video I made earlier in the year. It’s a really simple desk tour video where I walk people through my home office. The video was the third piece of content I released on my channel when I had just a few hundred subscribers. Since uploading, it’s earned over 3 million views, 44,000 subscribers, and surpassed every expectation I could have set for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this breakdown of The Art of Deconstruction was helpful for you. While this process can greatly improve the quality of your work, there’s no guarantee of success. &lt;em&gt;You still have to pray to the algorithm gods for that—just kidding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, I’ve used this approach throughout my life towards so many things: commercials, content, branding, business, cooking, fitness, and beyond. I hope that by applying these steps into your life and creative process, you can make great work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This presentation was originally given as a 1-hour lecture inside &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/Futur-Pro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Futur Pro Member Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/JFqiSr9A-Go&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Here’s How I Made This Video Using The Art Of Deconstruction:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Identify the goal:&lt;/strong&gt; My goal was to clean up my messy workspace, and I was inspired to document the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Research the subject and platform:&lt;/strong&gt; I started to look for ideas on YouTube and Pinterest and found that there was a whole community of people who openly shared their spaces and ideas around interior design. Upon discovering a well of great videos on YouTube, I decided that I could probably make own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Deconstruct, Analyze, &amp;amp; Understand:&lt;/strong&gt; In my research, I found dozens of examples that inspired me. I took the chill vibes and practical information of &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/RsFGoETBNy4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;David Zhang’s videos&lt;/a&gt;. I looked to the amazing storytelling and cinematography of &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/LAtHvlPViJo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Matt D’Vella&lt;/a&gt;, and formed a script similar to his writing style. The practical organization of &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/vb60rrtTddQ&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Casey Neistat’s New York studio&lt;/a&gt; helped me sort my gear, while I fell in love with the dark grey aesthetic of &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/rEkG75-5zPo&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Becki &amp;amp; Chris’&lt;/a&gt; living spaces. I realized that with much of this content, the ones that performed well all showcased components of &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/j2PeSpyMpHw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DIY building&lt;/a&gt; and used very affordable (IKEA) furniture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Emulate &amp;amp; Apply:&lt;/strong&gt; With all the pieces of new information and examples I gathered, I began the process of designing my home office and crafting a video around it. I took all the best qualities that I liked from my research and applied them to my work. I also took into consideration all of the keywords and tags used to describe all of the popular videos in this space. Given that YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, I wanted to optimize my video’s performance in search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Improve Upon:&lt;/strong&gt; I took the “remix” approach and applied all the best parts of the content I admired. I also found some “white space” in the genre of desk tours. Outside of this video from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/srKS4eypfk0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chari Marie TV&lt;/a&gt;, there weren’t many videos that were created for or by designers. I decided to appeal to that niche when crafting my video and explaining how I organized my space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to “go more in-depth” because I realized that outside of YouTube, there weren’t many other resources covering the desk tour space. So I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/thefuturishere/5-tips-to-organize-your-workspace-and-reclaim-your-productivity-855313648cae&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;companion article&lt;/a&gt; to the video and created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kit.com/MatthewEncina/matthew-encina-s-home-office-for-designers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;page on Kit&lt;/a&gt;, all to help with Google rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d9248d207aa1d665bb0848b_ArtofDeconstriction-002.010.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This presentation was originally given as a 1-hour lecture inside The Futur Pro Member Group.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this breakdown of The Art of Deconstruction was helpful for you.

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Art of Deconstruction&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been a creative professional for over 15 years working in branding, advertising, and design. With every project I’ve been a part of, I’m presented with new challenges I’ve never faced before. Needless to say, creative problem-solving has been the most common theme of my career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most valuable approaches to my work has been The Art of Deconstruction. This method helps me rapidly develop new skills and techniques to meet the demand of just about anything; like this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.matthewencina.com/coldplay-ink&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;interactive music video I created for Coldplay&lt;/a&gt;, or this &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/JFqiSr9A-Go&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;viral video I made on YouTube that’s amassed over 3 million views&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I share the above two examples not to flex, but to tell you that I didn’t have the tools or knowledge before I started those projects. Instead, I had a meticulous approach to dissecting similar examples out there and applying what I learned directly to my work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In short: I figured it out&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My goal in this article is to share this process with you so you can develop your analytical lens to break down, understand, and learn from the success of others before you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here is the Art of Deconstruction in 5 Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Identify the goal&lt;br/&gt;2. Research the subject and platform&lt;br/&gt;3. Deconstruct, Analyze, &amp;amp; Understand&lt;br/&gt;4. Emulate &amp;amp; Apply&lt;br/&gt;5. Improve Upon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Identify Your Goal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you want to do? It’s very important to identify your goal before you start anything. (I talk all about this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thefutur.com/great-kickoff-meeting-design-anything/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;in another article.&lt;/a&gt;) This will help you hyper-focus, save time, and give you a clear filter to help you evaluate your efforts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Here are a Few Examples of Goals: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take great portrait photos&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Paint like an Impressionist&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Remodel my home office&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Give a presentation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Research&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Find the top performers or best examples on a subject and particular platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who else has done this before?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you like?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does everyone else like?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What metrics are valuable to measure?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done a deep dive and can pick up on trends and patterns, select the cream of the crop. Pick the top 3-5 examples and include at least one anomaly—the example that performs as well as the rest, but breaks the common threads that link the others together. Anomalies will help to challenge the conclusions you might have from your findings to help you form a better hypothesis moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Deconstruct, Analyze, &amp;amp; Understand&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve gone to art school, you might be familiar with the “masterwork copy” assignment. You take a popular piece of art and simply copy it. Stroke by stroke. Color to color. The purpose is to help students develop their skills quickly by understanding how the masters made such great pieces of art. Through this process, they train their eyes on how to see and their hands how to make. Students add new tools to their toolbox as they solve the challenges of their own work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Whenever I Seek To Understand The Success Of Something, I Ask Myself A Few Questions:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are the main components and ingredients that make this up?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What specific attributes make it effective?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How did the person make it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How would you go about making that?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;If We Were To Apply This Line Of Questioning To A Van Gogh Painting, You Might Analyze It This Way:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The main components that make this up:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;the subject, Van Gogh, slightly off-center of the frame. He’s facing us 3/4 and is lit with a single key light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes it effective (beautiful):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;its organized rhythmic brush strokes, subtle muted split-complementary color palette, and high contrast at its focal point: his eyes and expression.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did he make it:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Using oil paints, Van Gogh created his self-portrait using repeating patterns of brushstrokes that follow the contours of the shapes of the subject.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Become A Reverse Engineer&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to reverse engineer something is one of the most effective ways to understand how great things are made and why they work.

I realized that with much of this content, the ones that performed well all showcased components of &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/j2PeSpyMpHw&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DIY building&lt;/a&gt; and used very affordable (IKEA) furniture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Emulate &amp;amp; Apply:&lt;/strong&gt; With all the pieces of new information and examples I gathered, I began the process of designing my home office and crafting a video around it. I took all the best qualities that I liked from my research and applied them to my work. I also took into consideration all of the keywords and tags used to describe all of the popular videos in this space. Given that YouTube is the second largest search engine in the world, I wanted to optimize my video’s performance in search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Improve Upon:&lt;/strong&gt; I took the “remix” approach and applied all the best parts of the content I admired. I also found some “white space” in the genre of desk tours. Outside of this video from &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/srKS4eypfk0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Chari Marie TV&lt;/a&gt;, there weren’t many videos that were created for or by designers. I decided to appeal to that niche when crafting my video and explaining how I organized my space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to “go more in-depth” because I realized that outside of YouTube, there weren’t many other resources covering the desk tour space. So I wrote a &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/thefuturishere/5-tips-to-organize-your-workspace-and-reclaim-your-productivity-855313648cae&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;companion article&lt;/a&gt; to the video and created a &lt;a href=&#34;https://kit.com/MatthewEncina/matthew-encina-s-home-office-for-designers&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;page on Kit&lt;/a&gt;, all to help with Google rankings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d9248d207aa1d665bb0848b_ArtofDeconstriction-002.010.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This presentation was originally given as a 1-hour lecture inside The Futur Pro Member Group.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope this breakdown of The Art of Deconstruction was helpful for you. While this process can greatly improve the quality of your work, there’s no guarantee of success. &lt;em&gt;You still have to pray to the algorithm gods for that—just kidding.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all seriousness, I’ve used this approach throughout my life towards so many things: commercials, content, branding, business, cooking, fitness, and beyond. I hope that by applying these steps into your life and creative process, you can make great work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This presentation was originally given as a 1-hour lecture inside &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/Futur-Pro&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Futur Pro Member Group&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested in having Matthew speak at your event, or want to sponsor his content, please send all business inquiries to &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hello@matthewencina.com&#34;&gt;hello@matthewencina.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>Avoid Anxiety While Keeping Up With Social Media</title>
    <updated>2019-09-17T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where some see an opportunity to grow their brand on social media platforms like Instagram, others might see it as frustrating, intimidating, and even a source of anxiety. But social media isn’t all bad. It can actually be a great place to grow your network, share your work and personality, and even reach potential clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a creative professional using social media, here are some ways to avoid feeling overwhelmed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Be a content creator&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Churning out images nonstop just for the sake of posting will quickly turn your profile into a place you won’t want to come back to. Instead, get into the habit of being a content creator. Produce content you enjoy and do it on your own time. Share what feels right and is authentic to you and your professional journey. You’re not on social media to please other people, you’re there to share what you’ve got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take it up a notch and share a shot of you in action, whether it’s you holding your physical packaging design, sitting in front of a wall you’ve painted, or even a time-lapse video of you building a website. Get creative!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note that you should use a platform that you enjoy and makes sense for what you’re doing. If you’re a hand lettering artist, Instagram is probably the best place for you to be. But if you don’t like the “social” aspect of it, maybe a platform like Dribbble is a better fit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Take Your Time&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been watching our videos and tuning in to our content for some time, you know that nothing happens overnight. We all start somewhere. When growing your social account, remember to be patient. Clients don’t come the minute you post your first photo; you have to get known first—share who you are and your work with your posts. The connections you make on social media can eventually lead you to events, conferences, and future projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You wouldn’t try to rush growing your business, right? You’d take your time with it. Remember to do the same with your social media account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Stay True To You&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparison is the threat of joy. It’s easy to look at another designer’s work and think, “Why can’t my logo look like that?” Everyone’s moving at their own pace, learning on their own time, and at different experience levels. We all bring our own flair to the table. Don’t forget yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay true to your course and remember to block out any negative opinions or attention, especially if you’re creating it by comparing yourself to others. Remind yourself of the specialness in what you do: you get to use your creativity every day to do what you love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Build Genuine Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;DM is the new email. Yep, you read that right, and it’s important. If you’re trying to grow your network over social media, you might want to start with direct messages. Sending a direct message—or DM—can actually help you reach more prospective clients, and potentially land more projects. But before you ask for any job or offer your services, build a relationship with the person you’re reaching out to first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The whole point of social media is to be social. Build a connection with someone by sharing why you like their work, how you came across their profile, and anything you might have learned from them. Ask them a question that’s easy for them to answer and opens up the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Social Media Isn&amp;#39;t a Requirement&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t want to be on social media? That’s OK, don’t. Not everyone is going to enjoy it or be interested in it. It’s totally fine to be a creative entrepreneur and not have an Instagram account. There are plenty of ways to network and grow your business without using social media. No matter where you are online, you’re going to have to put in the time and the effort to build your business’s presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Social media doesn’t have to be intimidating, a source of anxiety, or a weird place to showcase your work or business. Take advantage of the platform (hello, free mini-portfolio) and show other creatives, clients, and friends your talent, personality, and where you are in your journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you leverage your social profile?

    <title>Webflow Tips and Tricks From Our First Time</title>
    <updated>2019-07-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-07-11:/blog/webflow-responsive-design-tips</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of us at The Futur don’t have sturdy backgrounds in web design, so when the time comes to design and develop a website for a client, we find ourselves feeling a little overwhelmed. There are so many areas to work through: the overall design, user experience, copy, and mobile layout. Let’s not forget all of the various tools, plugins, and software options out there to choose from to build websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there’s an awesome tool out there that helps you easily design impressive, responsive websites, even if you don’t know how to code: Webflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first picked up Webflow to build the Hamilton Family Brewery’s site from our &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/LZtM7wyqe7w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Building a Brand series&lt;/a&gt;. At first glance, Webflow seemed just as intimidating as learning CSS, HTML, or Javascript. But after spending some time with it, we fell in love. The more we all used it, the easier it became to build a website—without any of us having a serious background in coding. We’re much more used to design programs like Photoshop and Illustrator, so we were pleasantly surprised to see how much Webflow looked and functioned like our favorite programs. During the building process, we noticed a few things that made Webflow truly stand out from other site builders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927d5be4622e365de225fc_Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%201.13.46%20PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. F&lt;strong&gt;irst Thing’s First: Flexbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Flexbox Layout is a CSS module that allows you to visually adjust multiple columns to be well, flexible, across different screen sizes. If you’re experienced at building websites, you know this part can get to be a little frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, without Webflow, you’d have to calculate the parent container and all of the child container’s widths to set pixels. And each time the screen would resize, you’d have to do it again. And again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with Webflow, we just set the parent container to flex, and set the child item widths as percentages. The containers would just scale to fit automatically without us having to manually adjust them. That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webflow also has integrated CSS grid, which we’ve heard is even better for larger scale layouts than Flexbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927d8bd8ca1e624bd3b8ac_Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%201.15.48%20PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Custom Content Types Made Easy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While building the Hamilton Brewery website, we wanted to make it easy for Josh and his team to add, edit, and remove beers from their online menu without having to go into each individual page to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webflow has a Content Management System (CMS) that allows you to make custom content types painlessly. For the Hamilton site, we created a new CMS Collection for the beers and defined the fields each beer would need to display. This would include things like the beer’s name, alcohol content, a short description, and label color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To style the item page, we worked with what Webflow calls Collection Pages. Think of them as templates for recurring pieces of content. So in this case, all the beers for Hamilton would share a similar page layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the page had the look and feel we wanted most, we hit publish and added the rest of the beers in the backend. With Webflow’s CMS, Josh and his team can create a new page for their beers without ever having to change the page design settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927da2624ca6c9f6a25b35_Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%201.18.24%20PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Hack Page Layouts with Symbols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases with page builders, you have to build each page individually, creating some pretty tedious work. Where page builders fall short, Webflow totally nails it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webflow embraces CSS classes so you can create symbols to be used repeatedly throughout your website. You can save your symbols in your preferred menu, and carry all edits throughout all of your symbols instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we were building the Hamilton site, we discovered a little trick. Full discretion: this might not be the intended use of symbols, but we’re going to tell you this anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We realized we were reusing pieces and parts of the site grid pretty often, so instead of copying and pasting the elements, we saved them as symbols. It automatically saved each piece in our menu, ready to be dragged into the artboard. Then, we’d disassociate it with the symbol since each piece would have its own content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need a visual explanation, check out our video below where we walk you through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927dd330c06b5a8eb15ed9_Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%201.19.02%20PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Create Amazing Animations, Fast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves a little eye candy, and animations can definitely take the visuals of your website up a notch. Webflow helps you create eye-catching animations fast and easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We added a hover animation on the Hamilton site by keyframing the popup elements and adjusting the start and end position for each. All we had to do was create the elements and add some settings to it. No code, no stress.

    <title>Webflow Tips and Tricks From Our First Time</title>
    <updated>2019-07-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-07-11:/blog/webflow-responsive-design-tips</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of us at The Futur don’t have sturdy backgrounds in web design, so when the time comes to design and develop a website for a client, we find ourselves feeling a little overwhelmed. There are so many areas to work through: the overall design, user experience, copy, and mobile layout. Let’s not forget all of the various tools, plugins, and software options out there to choose from to build websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, there’s an awesome tool out there that helps you easily design impressive, responsive websites, even if you don’t know how to code: Webflow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first picked up Webflow to build the Hamilton Family Brewery’s site from our &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/LZtM7wyqe7w&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Building a Brand series&lt;/a&gt;. At first glance, Webflow seemed just as intimidating as learning CSS, HTML, or Javascript. But after spending some time with it, we fell in love. The more we all used it, the easier it became to build a website—without any of us having a serious background in coding. We’re much more used to design programs like Photoshop and Illustrator, so we were pleasantly surprised to see how much Webflow looked and functioned like our favorite programs. During the building process, we noticed a few things that made Webflow truly stand out from other site builders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927d5be4622e365de225fc_Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%201.13.46%20PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. F&lt;strong&gt;irst Thing’s First: Flexbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Flexbox Layout is a CSS module that allows you to visually adjust multiple columns to be well, flexible, across different screen sizes. If you’re experienced at building websites, you know this part can get to be a little frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally, without Webflow, you’d have to calculate the parent container and all of the child container’s widths to set pixels. And each time the screen would resize, you’d have to do it again. And again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with Webflow, we just set the parent container to flex, and set the child item widths as percentages. The containers would just scale to fit automatically without us having to manually adjust them. That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webflow also has integrated CSS grid, which we’ve heard is even better for larger scale layouts than Flexbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927d8bd8ca1e624bd3b8ac_Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%201.15.48%20PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Custom Content Types Made Easy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;While building the Hamilton Brewery website, we wanted to make it easy for Josh and his team to add, edit, and remove beers from their online menu without having to go into each individual page to make changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webflow has a Content Management System (CMS) that allows you to make custom content types painlessly. For the Hamilton site, we created a new CMS Collection for the beers and defined the fields each beer would need to display. This would include things like the beer’s name, alcohol content, a short description, and label color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To style the item page, we worked with what Webflow calls Collection Pages. Think of them as templates for recurring pieces of content. So in this case, all the beers for Hamilton would share a similar page layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the page had the look and feel we wanted most, we hit publish and added the rest of the beers in the backend. With Webflow’s CMS, Josh and his team can create a new page for their beers without ever having to change the page design settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927da2624ca6c9f6a25b35_Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%201.18.24%20PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Hack Page Layouts with Symbols&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In most cases with page builders, you have to build each page individually, creating some pretty tedious work. Where page builders fall short, Webflow totally nails it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Webflow embraces CSS classes so you can create symbols to be used repeatedly throughout your website. You can save your symbols in your preferred menu, and carry all edits throughout all of your symbols instantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we were building the Hamilton site, we discovered a little trick. Full discretion: this might not be the intended use of symbols, but we’re going to tell you this anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We realized we were reusing pieces and parts of the site grid pretty often, so instead of copying and pasting the elements, we saved them as symbols. It automatically saved each piece in our menu, ready to be dragged into the artboard. Then, we’d disassociate it with the symbol since each piece would have its own content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you need a visual explanation, check out our video below where we walk you through it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927dd330c06b5a8eb15ed9_Screen%20Shot%202019-09-27%20at%201.19.02%20PM.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Create Amazing Animations, Fast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone loves a little eye candy, and animations can definitely take the visuals of your website up a notch. Webflow helps you create eye-catching animations fast and easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We added a hover animation on the Hamilton site by keyframing the popup elements and adjusting the start and end position for each. All we had to do was create the elements and add some settings to it. No code, no stress. It was totally mind-blowing to create such a simple animation so quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the amazing things you can do in Webflow. The best part?

    <title>Get Your First 5 Graphic Design Clients on LinkedIn</title>
    <updated>2019-06-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-06-14:/blog/get-graphic-design-clients-on-linkedin</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Quick Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step-by-step guide will teach you how to use Linkedin to contact the perfect type of clients you are looking for. This method aims to quickly create new connections with new prospects using new tools that are either free or inexpensive to use. There are many people who need graphic design work, it’s just a matter of finding them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;U&lt;strong&gt;nderstanding Client Expectations &amp;amp; Mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, you are a graphic design freelancer which can worry some companies. They don’t how to keep track of your work or if you will actually deliver. They will be uneasy when you first speak with them. Your job is to build their CONFIDENCE and show that you are a PROFESSIONAL. This is especially key if you are reaching out to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some quick rules of thumb:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO ARE PASSIONATE&lt;br/&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO ARE HARD WORKERS&lt;br/&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO HAVE A PORTFOLIO&lt;br/&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO ARE RESPONSIVE&lt;br/&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO ARE FLEXIBLE&lt;br/&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO ARE TRANSPARENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, clients want to know the work they pay for will get done and correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;S&lt;strong&gt;tep 1. Defining Your Customer Persona&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tell this to not only my employees, but also to my clients. It is important that you KNOW WHO YOUR AUDIENCE IS. You are not going to target everyone, and you are not going to take over everyone’s work. You need to first focus on a specific persona to start your lead generation. For example, if you are involved in health &amp;amp; fitness a lot, try to focus on clients in this realm. All leads and customers aren’t created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 80/20 principle tells that 80% of revenue is generated by 20% of customers. If we apply it once more, we’ll see that 4% of customers generate 64% of revenue. The real problem here is that most companies never give this 4% of customers and leads the time they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An customer profile helps you to collect the data from your customers from the specific market segment and to focus your inbound strategy on them, instead of prospecting everybody who might buy from you. This takes your Linkedin content from: “5 key lessons I learned about Fintech startups” to “5 key lessons I learned from running a fast growing Fintech start-up as a CEO” Knowing this, building your content strategy is a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are still deciding on your Ideal Customer Profile, start here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to get a free 15-page worksheet that helps you define your persona for you? You can download your free copy here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://social.brentonway.com/DCP-Ebook&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://brentonway.com/resources/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, put yourself in the business owners shoes. Would you pay that much for your service based on your portfolio &amp;amp; why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2. Defining Your Market Segment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different market segments who will potentially buy your product have different challenges, goals and, accordingly, seek completely different content. A senior marketer or head of growth from an enterprise SaaS might be looking for website creatives while a business owner will be looking for print designs for a conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The segment you define will allow you to better present your portfolio and be more effective in gaining client interest in the first place. Even if you try to create universal content that will fit both market segments, you’ll face another problem – relevant examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is another rule of thumb:&lt;br/&gt;Relevant content = relevant examples.&lt;br/&gt;When the head of marketing for ClassPass (net monthly revenue of $2M) sees examples that are related to an early-stage startup or print graphic, she’ll subconsciously mark the content as irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;S&lt;strong&gt;tep 3. Finding Your Customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we are going to do now is use an amazing tool to build a large list of decision-makers based on your defined customer persona and your targeted segment. I Highly recommend purchasing sales navigator for this. You can also sign up for a 1 month free trial for sales navigator &lt;a href=&#34;https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/sales-navigator&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This will let you connect with a lot more prospects and get many more search results for your lead generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://useorca.com/referral/gHfih4rl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;useorca.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click download the app&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the top you will click Create Campaign&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will then see a search area where you can define who you want to target. For the demonstration, I have broken it down simply as: &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connections to &lt;strong&gt;1st Connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Industries as &lt;strong&gt;Computer Games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Locations as &lt;strong&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Main search as &lt;strong&gt;marketing manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384db0dbcef2_Jonathan-post-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Basically, we will be finding people based on this criterion on Linkedin and connecting with them. Here is a sample of the connections I got:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938565bdbcef3_Jonathan-post-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;S&lt;strong&gt;tep 4. Creating &amp;amp; Sending Your Pitch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our search down, we need to prepare our pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are 4 golden rules to follow when creating your pitch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the pitch as unique as possible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be respectful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep it brief&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be transparent for what you are asking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rely on your strengths when writing your pitch. It won’t help you to just write a generic message to these people. Asking someone to give you business is easy to do. Show them why it makes sense to use you as their graphic designer. Make them imagine the experience by showing that you are involved with their community or live close by so you can meet with them if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of how it should look:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693896a7dbce6a_Jonathan-post-3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve created 2 pitches for you to use as a &lt;strong&gt;guideline&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample pitch 1 (Soft Approach) :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey {{first_name}},&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m getting more involved in the gaming sector as a graphic designer. Thought it made sense to introduce myself and share some of my portfolio with you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also saw you were based in Los Angeles so we are pretty close by.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Followup:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glad we connected, let me know if it makes sense to talk sometime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No worries if you are busy – I can share some of my work through email if that’s better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample pitch 2 (Hard Approach)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi {{first_name}},&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m reaching out to see if your team might need a fractional graphic designer. I work primarily in the gaming industry for clients such as RIOT, TSM Gaming, &amp;amp; Ubisoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also based in San Diego and would love to present some mockups to your team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Followup:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glad we connected, let me know if it makes sense to talk sometime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can share it with someone else from your team if it’s better?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5. Manually Following Up On Prospects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that you are doing outreach and that not everyone is going to reply to your messages. Don’t be discouraged if you feel that you have a very small reply rate, it’s a start and that’s what matters. You want to shoot for a 5% positive response rate. That is a great start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, slowly iterate your pitch and work your way up to 10%. To improve your reply rate, you can do another manual follow-up to your prospect sharing specific ideas that you can implement for them. Think about how will what you do benefit them and what result they can expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269386e9cdbcef5_Jonathan-post-4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first messaged this prospect 5 months ago when we launched a new marketing product for organizations.&lt;br/&gt;He didn’t respond.&lt;br/&gt;I personally followed up with a connection and soft-introduction on Linkedin.&lt;br/&gt;He still didn’t answer.&lt;br/&gt;I then sent another message thanking him for connecting with me and that if he had received my email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6. Finding Your Contacts Email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 1&lt;/strong&gt;- we are now going to find the email addresses of the people we contacted through Linkedin. We can do this by using a free extension called Clearbit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Make sure you have Google Chrome installed for this. We will be using an extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;a href=&#34;https://connect.clearbit.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;connect.clearbit.com&lt;/a&gt; to easily find anyone’s email address that works in a specific company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find the company you want to reach out to. I will take a specific person from our Linkedin search.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once you have found the company, compose an email through the gmail extension and you should see it there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now I will type the name of the company or domain that I am trying to get in touch with&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on the prospect that you reached out to on Linkedin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my test, I am looking at Emmanuel Valdez who is the Art Director for Day Break Games. I can see that it gives me his email address right there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381a18dbcef4_Jonathan-post-5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 2&lt;/strong&gt; – we can also find our prospects email by scraping search engines any public contact information. We will be using another free tool simply called “Email Finder”. You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/email-finder/dbmjjcmdhfjbgkgigdndfnfddminlpgb?hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;download it here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit the company website&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on the extension found on the top right of your address bar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let it perform its search and click back on the extension&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should now see a list of emails available from that website that you can now contact&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now go get yourself some clients!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;About This Author:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Saeidian is the Founder &amp;amp; CEO of &lt;a href=&#34;https://brentonway.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brenton Way&lt;/a&gt;, a digital marketing agency that drives growth for brands &amp;amp; ventures. He fully bootstrapped the agency and 2 other companies to a 6-figure business in 6 months through outbound marketing alone. Their company now works with key players in the financial, regulations, and cloud sector to generate high market qualified leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes that by reverse-engineering each service, you are able to uncover unique opportunities to help set your business apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcf63d298d13eedaa83a_5e473e783b2e661836185341_image-profile-ben2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Burns is a designer that helps growing businesses increase revenue, expand brand awareness, and earn happier customers.

    <title>Get Your First 5 Graphic Design Clients on LinkedIn</title>
    <updated>2019-06-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-06-14:/blog/get-graphic-design-clients-on-linkedin</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Quick Introduction&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step-by-step guide will teach you how to use Linkedin to contact the perfect type of clients you are looking for. This method aims to quickly create new connections with new prospects using new tools that are either free or inexpensive to use. There are many people who need graphic design work, it’s just a matter of finding them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;U&lt;strong&gt;nderstanding Client Expectations &amp;amp; Mindset&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, you are a graphic design freelancer which can worry some companies. They don’t how to keep track of your work or if you will actually deliver. They will be uneasy when you first speak with them. Your job is to build their CONFIDENCE and show that you are a PROFESSIONAL. This is especially key if you are reaching out to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some quick rules of thumb:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO ARE PASSIONATE&lt;br/&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO ARE HARD WORKERS&lt;br/&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO HAVE A PORTFOLIO&lt;br/&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO ARE RESPONSIVE&lt;br/&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO ARE FLEXIBLE&lt;br/&gt;CLIENTS LIKE TO WORK WITH DESIGNERS WHO ARE TRANSPARENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember, clients want to know the work they pay for will get done and correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;S&lt;strong&gt;tep 1. Defining Your Customer Persona&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tell this to not only my employees, but also to my clients. It is important that you KNOW WHO YOUR AUDIENCE IS. You are not going to target everyone, and you are not going to take over everyone’s work. You need to first focus on a specific persona to start your lead generation. For example, if you are involved in health &amp;amp; fitness a lot, try to focus on clients in this realm. All leads and customers aren’t created equal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 80/20 principle tells that 80% of revenue is generated by 20% of customers. If we apply it once more, we’ll see that 4% of customers generate 64% of revenue. The real problem here is that most companies never give this 4% of customers and leads the time they deserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An customer profile helps you to collect the data from your customers from the specific market segment and to focus your inbound strategy on them, instead of prospecting everybody who might buy from you. This takes your Linkedin content from: “5 key lessons I learned about Fintech startups” to “5 key lessons I learned from running a fast growing Fintech start-up as a CEO” Knowing this, building your content strategy is a piece of cake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are still deciding on your Ideal Customer Profile, start here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to get a free 15-page worksheet that helps you define your persona for you? You can download your free copy here: &lt;a href=&#34;http://social.brentonway.com/DCP-Ebook&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://brentonway.com/resources/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, put yourself in the business owners shoes. Would you pay that much for your service based on your portfolio &amp;amp; why?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2. Defining Your Market Segment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different market segments who will potentially buy your product have different challenges, goals and, accordingly, seek completely different content. A senior marketer or head of growth from an enterprise SaaS might be looking for website creatives while a business owner will be looking for print designs for a conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The segment you define will allow you to better present your portfolio and be more effective in gaining client interest in the first place. Even if you try to create universal content that will fit both market segments, you’ll face another problem – relevant examples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is another rule of thumb:&lt;br/&gt;Relevant content = relevant examples.&lt;br/&gt;When the head of marketing for ClassPass (net monthly revenue of $2M) sees examples that are related to an early-stage startup or print graphic, she’ll subconsciously mark the content as irrelevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;S&lt;strong&gt;tep 3. Finding Your Customers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What we are going to do now is use an amazing tool to build a large list of decision-makers based on your defined customer persona and your targeted segment. I Highly recommend purchasing sales navigator for this. You can also sign up for a 1 month free trial for sales navigator &lt;a href=&#34;https://business.linkedin.com/sales-solutions/sales-navigator&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. This will let you connect with a lot more prospects and get many more search results for your lead generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit &lt;a href=&#34;https://useorca.com/referral/gHfih4rl&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;useorca.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click download the app&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At the top you will click Create Campaign&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will then see a search area where you can define who you want to target. For the demonstration, I have broken it down simply as: &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Connections to &lt;strong&gt;1st Connection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Industries as &lt;strong&gt;Computer Games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Locations as &lt;strong&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Main search as &lt;strong&gt;marketing manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384db0dbcef2_Jonathan-post-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this mean? Basically, we will be finding people based on this criterion on Linkedin and connecting with them. Here is a sample of the connections I got:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938565bdbcef3_Jonathan-post-2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;S&lt;strong&gt;tep 4. Creating &amp;amp; Sending Your Pitch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we have our search down, we need to prepare our pitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are 4 golden rules to follow when creating your pitch:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make the pitch as unique as possible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be respectful&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keep it brief&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Be transparent for what you are asking&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rely on your strengths when writing your pitch. It won’t help you to just write a generic message to these people. Asking someone to give you business is easy to do. Show them why it makes sense to use you as their graphic designer. Make them imagine the experience by showing that you are involved with their community or live close by so you can meet with them if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of how it should look:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693896a7dbce6a_Jonathan-post-3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve created 2 pitches for you to use as a &lt;strong&gt;guideline&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample pitch 1 (Soft Approach) :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hey {{first_name}},&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m getting more involved in the gaming sector as a graphic designer. Thought it made sense to introduce myself and share some of my portfolio with you?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also saw you were based in Los Angeles so we are pretty close by.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Followup:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glad we connected, let me know if it makes sense to talk sometime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;No worries if you are busy – I can share some of my work through email if that’s better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sample pitch 2 (Hard Approach)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hi {{first_name}},&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m reaching out to see if your team might need a fractional graphic designer. I work primarily in the gaming industry for clients such as RIOT, TSM Gaming, &amp;amp; Ubisoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also based in San Diego and would love to present some mockups to your team.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Followup:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Glad we connected, let me know if it makes sense to talk sometime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can share it with someone else from your team if it’s better?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5. Manually Following Up On Prospects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that you are doing outreach and that not everyone is going to reply to your messages. Don’t be discouraged if you feel that you have a very small reply rate, it’s a start and that’s what matters. You want to shoot for a 5% positive response rate. That is a great start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From there, slowly iterate your pitch and work your way up to 10%. To improve your reply rate, you can do another manual follow-up to your prospect sharing specific ideas that you can implement for them. Think about how will what you do benefit them and what result they can expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269386e9cdbcef5_Jonathan-post-4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We first messaged this prospect 5 months ago when we launched a new marketing product for organizations.&lt;br/&gt;He didn’t respond.&lt;br/&gt;I personally followed up with a connection and soft-introduction on Linkedin.&lt;br/&gt;He still didn’t answer.&lt;br/&gt;I then sent another message thanking him for connecting with me and that if he had received my email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6. Finding Your Contacts Email&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 1&lt;/strong&gt;- we are now going to find the email addresses of the people we contacted through Linkedin. We can do this by using a free extension called Clearbit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Make sure you have Google Chrome installed for this. We will be using an extension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;a href=&#34;https://connect.clearbit.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;connect.clearbit.com&lt;/a&gt; to easily find anyone’s email address that works in a specific company.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Find the company you want to reach out to. I will take a specific person from our Linkedin search.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once you have found the company, compose an email through the gmail extension and you should see it there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now I will type the name of the company or domain that I am trying to get in touch with&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on the prospect that you reached out to on Linkedin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;For my test, I am looking at Emmanuel Valdez who is the Art Director for Day Break Games. I can see that it gives me his email address right there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381a18dbcef4_Jonathan-post-5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Method 2&lt;/strong&gt; – we can also find our prospects email by scraping search engines any public contact information. We will be using another free tool simply called “Email Finder”. You can &lt;a href=&#34;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/email-finder/dbmjjcmdhfjbgkgigdndfnfddminlpgb?hl=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;download it here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visit the company website&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Click on the extension found on the top right of your address bar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Let it perform its search and click back on the extension&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You should now see a list of emails available from that website that you can now contact&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now go get yourself some clients!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;About This Author:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Saeidian is the Founder &amp;amp; CEO of &lt;a href=&#34;https://brentonway.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Brenton Way&lt;/a&gt;, a digital marketing agency that drives growth for brands &amp;amp; ventures. He fully bootstrapped the agency and 2 other companies to a 6-figure business in 6 months through outbound marketing alone. Their company now works with key players in the financial, regulations, and cloud sector to generate high market qualified leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He believes that by reverse-engineering each service, you are able to uncover unique opportunities to help set your business apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcf63d298d13eedaa83a_5e473e783b2e661836185341_image-profile-ben2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Burns is a designer that helps growing businesses increase revenue, expand brand awareness, and earn happier customers.

    <title>Futur Daily Design Initiative</title>
    <updated>2019-06-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-06-02:/blog/futur-daily-design-initiative</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was such a genius idea to mash-up two iconic brands in unexpected ways. I was drawn to the simplicity, typography, colors and distinctive graphics. Meanwhile, I had spoken to some amazing guests on The Futur and they all seemed to echo the same message—work on personal projects. This was vital to being an artist. We heard &lt;a href=&#34;https://gmunk.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GMUNK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://elizabethcareysmith.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Elizabeth Carey Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.baugasm.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Baugasm&lt;/a&gt; all say essentially the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I was searching for something that I could do on a daily basis—tight parameters, easy and fun to do, didn’t require special equipment or space to produce—it came to me. Eureka! Go back to the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, my love for design didn’t begin with the works of Paul Rand, Herb Lubalin, Lou Dorfsman or Bradbury Thompson. It began with skateboarding. Yes, skateboarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many “serious” skateboarders picked decks based on their affinity towards a particular skate brand, professional rider, or board shape, I mostly picked boards based on the visual appeal. As a kid growing up in the 80s, I was drawn towards brands like Santa Cruz skateboards, especially the illustration work of Jim Phillips: The screaming hand, Rob Roskopp melting face, Jeff Kendal snake bite, Jason Jesse Neptune &amp;amp; Sun God, and Corey O’Brien’s Grim Reaper. Then there was Vision’s Psycho Stick, Gator’s mesmerizing Op-Art spiral and the instant classic Mark Gonzalez deck.

    <title>Futur Daily Design Initiative</title>
    <updated>2019-06-02T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-06-02:/blog/futur-daily-design-initiative</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was such a genius idea to mash-up two iconic brands in unexpected ways. I was drawn to the simplicity, typography, colors and distinctive graphics. Meanwhile, I had spoken to some amazing guests on The Futur and they all seemed to echo the same message—work on personal projects. This was vital to being an artist. We heard &lt;a href=&#34;https://gmunk.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;GMUNK&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://elizabethcareysmith.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Elizabeth Carey Smith&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://shop.baugasm.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Baugasm&lt;/a&gt; all say essentially the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I was searching for something that I could do on a daily basis—tight parameters, easy and fun to do, didn’t require special equipment or space to produce—it came to me. Eureka! Go back to the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see, my love for design didn’t begin with the works of Paul Rand, Herb Lubalin, Lou Dorfsman or Bradbury Thompson. It began with skateboarding. Yes, skateboarding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many “serious” skateboarders picked decks based on their affinity towards a particular skate brand, professional rider, or board shape, I mostly picked boards based on the visual appeal. As a kid growing up in the 80s, I was drawn towards brands like Santa Cruz skateboards, especially the illustration work of Jim Phillips: The screaming hand, Rob Roskopp melting face, Jeff Kendal snake bite, Jason Jesse Neptune &amp;amp; Sun God, and Corey O’Brien’s Grim Reaper. Then there was Vision’s Psycho Stick, Gator’s mesmerizing Op-Art spiral and the instant classic Mark Gonzalez deck. This list wouldn’t be complete without mentioning skateboarding giant Powell Peralta. My favorite was Steve Caballero’s Dragon, Mike Vallely elephant, Tony Hawk skull hawk, and Mike McGill’s skull/snake. Other notable mentions: Christian Hosoi hammerhead, Chris Miller man/dog, and SMA’s Natas Kaupas design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938dd8fdbce42_Typography-swiss-deck-01-300x300.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Wolfgang Weingart&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938d134dbce43_Typography-swiss-deck-03-300x300.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Josef Müller Brockmann&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269382ec1dbce46_Typography-swiss-deck-05-300x300.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381c69dbce47_Skateboard-deck-01-300x300.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381488dbce45_Skateboard-deck-02-300x300.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938b552dbce44_Skateboard-deck-03-300x300.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To test the idea, I bought a skateboard mock-up template from Creative Market.

    <title>Airline Brand Identity Design by the Young Guns</title>
    <updated>2019-05-16T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-05-16:/blog/airline-brand-identity-design-by-the-young-guns</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we take a look back at the work from the Season 1 Brand Identity Design Challenge to understand their approach and design solutions. The project brief was to design a first-class airline sub-brand for an existing airline. Their results were amazing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the Young Guns started with a more formal approach to the project by diagnosing the brand and creating Stylescapes™ to establish the brand’s visual language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385e0edbcf1e_Ace-Stylescape-1b-1200x225.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sean Campbell - AAce&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938de5fdbcf1f_Stylescape-I_B-1200x270.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sharif El-Komi - Crimson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re interested in developing your brand design skills, check out our following courses:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d9279dfd8ca1e38f6d19b7a_the-futur-learn-typography.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/logo-design-construction&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927a189f5e430dfa15f8ce_the-futur-logo-design-and-construction.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/stylescapes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927a4543cc6767842a5cb8_the-futur-stylescapes-course.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Now Let&amp;#39;s Dive into Their Projects&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381080dbcefc_Sean-campbell.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938b3d9dbcefb_Business-Card-mockup.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Business Card&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Overall Idea&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea for the system stems from the American Airlines logo, which the AAce logo is derived from. All of the patterns I designed are then in turn extrapolated from the logo. I was inspired by the old AA identity and tried to bring some of the simplicity while still keeping the design interesting and in line with the new branding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269389ad3dbcefe_Free-Bus-Stop-Advertisement-Mockup-prev02_2000x.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Transportation stop billboard&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385fc9dbcf00_Menu-Mockup-3.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dining Menu&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from coming up with a great name, the main challenge of this project was find the sweet spot for the visuals that both fit within the existing American Airlines identity, and still feeling premium and different than standard class. I struggled a lot towards the beginning of the project and ended up scrapping a lot of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938f8c3dbcefd_priority-check-in-mockup.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Airport counter signage&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938156cdbcf04_Ticket-Mockup-2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Airline ticket&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary of Design Solution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep the design consistent with American’s existing branding, I used a similar yet expanded color palette, used the same typeface, Frutiger, and many design elements follow a consistent diagonal angle that is taken from the American logo. I also tried as much as possible to show how this brand will look and live in the real world next to the existing branding. I may not have did the best job at making the design feel special and premium, but I tried to tackle the problem by highlighting big beautiful signage, high quality printing effects and materials, as well as carefully crafted mockups. I’ve learned that when attempting to position a brand at a more expensive and premium price point, the devil is in the details and that feeling of exquisiteness comes from the entire design being refined and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938dec8dbcf01_Welcome-Check-In-Mockup.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kiosk backdrop&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being on the show has been an amazing experience and I thank everybody involved!

They clearly mention their mission is to redefine air travel in India and provide a more personalized flying experience. I felt they are the ones most likely to come up with an upper business class / premium flying experience. I didn’t wanna go on Etihad level of luxury as I felt it was unrealistic for Vistara to do that in India. So “Serenity by Vistara” is more like an upper business class, VIP experience. I based the whole thing around having the sense of peace and not having to worry about anything while traveling “Serenity class”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693854c7dbceff_arun-img3.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Boarding pass with no ads on the back side to give a stress-free feeling.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269383266dbcf06_arun-img4.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This envelope comes as a part of welcome vanity kit&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming up with the name of the VIP class was the most difficult task, I spent a considerable amount of time on just that. Then there was the challenge to distinguish Serenity enough from Vistara so it can stand on its own, feel like a VIP class but still feel like part of Vistara Airlines. Having to define that visual language and style was very difficult and I struggled with it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269382f3adbcf05_arun-img5.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693828ccdbcf07_arun-img6.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Logo on print&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269387172dbcf08_arun-img7.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Deconstructing Vistara’s current logo to make Serenity logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary of Design Solution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote down everything I wanted “Serenity” to feel like and started back-tracking from there to come up with a few names which relate to Vistara’s limitless expanse meaning. I was very happy with the name and the logo I decided to work with. It feels just right. I think I failed to come up with a proper visual language and that was pretty evident in Chris’ critique of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693833dbdbcf09_arun-img8.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Vistara and Serenity logos for side by side comparison&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a challenging project. It proved to me that you can’t design in a closed silo. You always have to think of the bigger picture, the whole system and the ways you can always make the system versatile enough to be applied on any medium. I think that’s one of the reasons why Sean’s design won. He had a solid design system in place which connected everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Find Me:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/scientistxdesigns/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/scientistxdesigns/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thescientistx.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.thescientistx.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dribbble.com/ScientistX&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://dribbble.com/ScientistX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269389558dbcf0a_connor-fowler.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938da69dbcf0b_CF_Airline_Tag_1-2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Two large Jet2vip airline luggage tags with heavy emphasis on the flight destination.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Overall Idea&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall idea for this project was to take a budget airline and give it a premium class. I wanted to create a slightly more luxurious experience than standard economy but not the crazy extreme luxury you might find from an airline such as Etihad. Taking Jet2 customers one step closer to a more VIP experience rather than jumping to an entirely new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938da84dbcf0f_CF_Airline_Tag_2-1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Two small Jet2vip airline luggage tags designed for small carry on items.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938b0d6dbcf0c_CF_Airline_Tag_4-1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Alternative large airline tag specifically for VIP members flying with Jet2.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was faced with the concept of branching out a well established budget airline into a category it did not serve at all. Everything about Jet2 feels budget and lightweight, so the biggest challenge for me was to develop a more luxurious side without alienating their current audience. I needed to make Jet2vip to feel seamless alongside the rest of Jet2’s subdivisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384b2fdbcf0e_CF_Airline_Tag_7-2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Large Jet2vip airline luggage tag in use on a suitcase.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938421adbcf0d_CF_Cabin_Menu_Front.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Proposed Dinner Menu for Jet2vip customers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary of Design Solution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assets I created for the Jet2vip branding were designed to integrate and sit well amongst the rest of the Jet2 ecosystem. By channeling a large portion of Jet2’s current design conventions, large patterns, bold text and bright colours, I was able to bring a fresh perspective to their VIP department without deviating away from their original mission. The tags and pin I designed were created to give the customer a sense of luxury and ownership, without feeling too far out of reach from their current situation. Each element is designed with clarity, positivity and a sense of familiarity in mind. This creates a solution that fits within the Jet2 ecosystem and helps each customer easily transition into a new airline class, giving them their first taste of flying VIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693801fbdbcf10_YG19_Airline_Project_ConnorFowler_Page_2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A collection of small and large format luggage tags showcasing the new Jet2vip branding.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I felt my intentions for this project were good. My strategy was heading in the right direction but, unfortunately my execution of the designs and presentation felt lacklustre. This was due to largely being overloaded with client work and poor scheduling at the time. I knew when I submitted the project it wasn’t my best work but I had no more time to improve on it. Young Guns was always more about learning and feedback than being a “winner” so I am not disappointed with the project because I now know where to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Find Me:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://connorfowler.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://connorfowler.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://instagram.com/cfowlerdesign&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://instagram.com/cfowlerdesign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cfowlerdesign&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/cfowlerdesign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://connorfowler.com/the-fowler-hour&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://connorfowler.com/the-fowler-hour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938004bdbcf12_sharif-Elkomi.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384bc2dbcf11_Boarding-Pass.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Boarding pass&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Overall Idea&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to capture the essence of “Swiss” as it exists in our collective subconscious. The brand, in my mind, had to be obvious but also subtle enough to look premium on application. I wanted people who flew Crimson to be able to be able to use whatever they were given on the plane later on because it feels and looks premium enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693836eddbcf15_Uniform-Concept.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Uniform concept&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938630ddbcf13_Crew-Uniform.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Crew uniform&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to balance clean minimal design while communicating a premium feel. It was also very challenging working on applications I’ve never dealt with before such as the boarding pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381d22dbcf17_Cabin-Menu.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cabin Menu&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary of Design Solution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I designed what I see as a very simple flexible mark essentially designed with applications in mind. It works on billboards, printed on the menu, small, big, embroidered; that was the idea. Visually, the royal blue accent complemented the crimson color nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269380415dbcf14_Tag.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Luggage tag&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project was the most fun I’ve had on the Young Guns, it was challenging and I definitely felt like I had to pull out all the tricks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Find Me:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behance – &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behance.net/sharifelkomi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.behance.net/sharifelkomi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269380e1cdbcf16_Spencer-fraye.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693849a6dbcf20_Stylescape-Final-1200x360.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A stylescape to help showcase the brand aura and general feeling.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Overall Idea&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall goal of the project was to imagine what a premium/VIP class would be for the German Airline Lufthansa. My approach to the project was to use a faithful design language and geometric similarities to tie the two brands together visually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269389b91dbcf18_Baggage-drop-off.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Signage to help customers navigate the airport.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693808ebdbcf19_Metallic-Extrusion.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A 3D extruded sign showing the mark in different materials.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges of the project was weighing the differences between a premium-feeling brand, faithful design, and appropriate cultural style. Because Lufthansa is already a very premium-feeling brand, trying to ‘level up’ the brand was a challenge in and of itself. I ended up using a cooler and richer color palette paired with didot as a typeface to create a premium feeling brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938659ddbcf1a_Nest-Bag.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A travel bag showcasing what the “Nest” Identity would look like in context.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693856dedbcf1b_Signage.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A promotional sign to help customers feel at home with the brand.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938195adbcf1c_Logo-Geometry-_-Origin.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A visualization to help personnel see the transformation between the established brand and the new variant.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary of Design Solution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges I faced was in finding a suitable name for the brand. Because Lufthansa is a German airline with a German name, finding something that would work in both German and English was definitely a challenge. My solution was the name “Nest”, which is a word that works in both English and German. Everything beyond that just fell in to place, the brand atmosphere, the colors, typography. The other big problem was in weighing the differences between this VIP class and the larger airline brand. The goal was to create something distinct and uniquely better, but something that didn’t deviate too far from the brand. The ultimate product was something that I believe to be an elegant and minimalist solution to accompany an already powerful, established brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269387797dbcf1d_Wordmark-Icon.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The final Logomark.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young Guns has given me not only the practical and tangible skills needed in my career, but also the general mindset and approach I need to have going forward in my career. Young Guns has done a brilliant job of creating an environment for people like me to fail, experiment, play, and learn. I have grown so incredibly much from this experience, I am beyond thankful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Find Me:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;@spencerfraye (twitter, instagram, facebook)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Young Guns Series 1 was a chance for 5 designers from across the globe to participate in a design mentorship program with Chris Do. They had the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of graphic design and business mindset through a series of challenges and coaching calls. Our mission was to share the learning experiences of these talented designers through their processes and struggles, so that we can all learn together.If you haven’t watched any of the Young Guns Season 1 episodes, check them out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9uU-ZjgiHU&amp;amp;list=PLzKJi2GjpkEGJPn0rwPSDlS9gW6Yp5YO8&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;here on our YouTube channel.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Season 2 has also started.

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we take a look back at the work from the Season 1 Brand Identity Design Challenge to understand their approach and design solutions. The project brief was to design a first-class airline sub-brand for an existing airline. Their results were amazing!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the Young Guns started with a more formal approach to the project by diagnosing the brand and creating Stylescapes™ to establish the brand’s visual language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385e0edbcf1e_Ace-Stylescape-1b-1200x225.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sean Campbell - AAce&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938de5fdbcf1f_Stylescape-I_B-1200x270.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Sharif El-Komi - Crimson&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you’re interested in developing your brand design skills, check out our following courses:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/typography-01&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d9279dfd8ca1e38f6d19b7a_the-futur-learn-typography.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/logo-design-construction&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927a189f5e430dfa15f8ce_the-futur-logo-design-and-construction.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/stylescapes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d927a4543cc6767842a5cb8_the-futur-stylescapes-course.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Now Let&amp;#39;s Dive into Their Projects&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381080dbcefc_Sean-campbell.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938b3d9dbcefb_Business-Card-mockup.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Business Card&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Overall Idea&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea for the system stems from the American Airlines logo, which the AAce logo is derived from. All of the patterns I designed are then in turn extrapolated from the logo. I was inspired by the old AA identity and tried to bring some of the simplicity while still keeping the design interesting and in line with the new branding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269389ad3dbcefe_Free-Bus-Stop-Advertisement-Mockup-prev02_2000x.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Transportation stop billboard&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385fc9dbcf00_Menu-Mockup-3.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Dining Menu&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from coming up with a great name, the main challenge of this project was find the sweet spot for the visuals that both fit within the existing American Airlines identity, and still feeling premium and different than standard class. I struggled a lot towards the beginning of the project and ended up scrapping a lot of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938f8c3dbcefd_priority-check-in-mockup.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Airport counter signage&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938156cdbcf04_Ticket-Mockup-2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Airline ticket&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary of Design Solution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep the design consistent with American’s existing branding, I used a similar yet expanded color palette, used the same typeface, Frutiger, and many design elements follow a consistent diagonal angle that is taken from the American logo. I also tried as much as possible to show how this brand will look and live in the real world next to the existing branding. I may not have did the best job at making the design feel special and premium, but I tried to tackle the problem by highlighting big beautiful signage, high quality printing effects and materials, as well as carefully crafted mockups. I’ve learned that when attempting to position a brand at a more expensive and premium price point, the devil is in the details and that feeling of exquisiteness comes from the entire design being refined and resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938dec8dbcf01_Welcome-Check-In-Mockup.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Kiosk backdrop&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being on the show has been an amazing experience and I thank everybody involved! I’m incredibly grateful to have been given the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Find Me:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behance.net/sjcampbell&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.behance.net/sjcampbell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/seancampbelldesign&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/seancampbelldesign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/seancampbelldesign&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/in/seancampbelldesign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269386d70dbcf02_Arun-sharma.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381d58dbcf03_arun-img1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The idea was to give the feeling of Serenity, aligned with Vistara’s current marketing material which features pink clouds.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Overall Idea&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I selected Vistara Airlines based on the criteria on their about page. They clearly mention their mission is to redefine air travel in India and provide a more personalized flying experience. I felt they are the ones most likely to come up with an upper business class / premium flying experience. I didn’t wanna go on Etihad level of luxury as I felt it was unrealistic for Vistara to do that in India. So “Serenity by Vistara” is more like an upper business class, VIP experience. I based the whole thing around having the sense of peace and not having to worry about anything while traveling “Serenity class”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693854c7dbceff_arun-img3.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Boarding pass with no ads on the back side to give a stress-free feeling.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269383266dbcf06_arun-img4.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;This envelope comes as a part of welcome vanity kit&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming up with the name of the VIP class was the most difficult task, I spent a considerable amount of time on just that. Then there was the challenge to distinguish Serenity enough from Vistara so it can stand on its own, feel like a VIP class but still feel like part of Vistara Airlines. Having to define that visual language and style was very difficult and I struggled with it a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269382f3adbcf05_arun-img5.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693828ccdbcf07_arun-img6.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Logo on print&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269387172dbcf08_arun-img7.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Deconstructing Vistara’s current logo to make Serenity logo&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary of Design Solution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote down everything I wanted “Serenity” to feel like and started back-tracking from there to come up with a few names which relate to Vistara’s limitless expanse meaning. I was very happy with the name and the logo I decided to work with. It feels just right. I think I failed to come up with a proper visual language and that was pretty evident in Chris’ critique of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693833dbdbcf09_arun-img8.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Vistara and Serenity logos for side by side comparison&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was a challenging project. It proved to me that you can’t design in a closed silo. You always have to think of the bigger picture, the whole system and the ways you can always make the system versatile enough to be applied on any medium. I think that’s one of the reasons why Sean’s design won. He had a solid design system in place which connected everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Find Me:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/scientistxdesigns/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/scientistxdesigns/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thescientistx.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.thescientistx.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dribbble.com/ScientistX&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://dribbble.com/ScientistX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269389558dbcf0a_connor-fowler.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938da69dbcf0b_CF_Airline_Tag_1-2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Two large Jet2vip airline luggage tags with heavy emphasis on the flight destination.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Overall Idea&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall idea for this project was to take a budget airline and give it a premium class. I wanted to create a slightly more luxurious experience than standard economy but not the crazy extreme luxury you might find from an airline such as Etihad. Taking Jet2 customers one step closer to a more VIP experience rather than jumping to an entirely new level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938da84dbcf0f_CF_Airline_Tag_2-1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Two small Jet2vip airline luggage tags designed for small carry on items.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938b0d6dbcf0c_CF_Airline_Tag_4-1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Alternative large airline tag specifically for VIP members flying with Jet2.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was faced with the concept of branching out a well established budget airline into a category it did not serve at all. Everything about Jet2 feels budget and lightweight, so the biggest challenge for me was to develop a more luxurious side without alienating their current audience. I needed to make Jet2vip to feel seamless alongside the rest of Jet2’s subdivisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384b2fdbcf0e_CF_Airline_Tag_7-2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Large Jet2vip airline luggage tag in use on a suitcase.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938421adbcf0d_CF_Cabin_Menu_Front.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Proposed Dinner Menu for Jet2vip customers.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary of Design Solution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assets I created for the Jet2vip branding were designed to integrate and sit well amongst the rest of the Jet2 ecosystem. By channeling a large portion of Jet2’s current design conventions, large patterns, bold text and bright colours, I was able to bring a fresh perspective to their VIP department without deviating away from their original mission. The tags and pin I designed were created to give the customer a sense of luxury and ownership, without feeling too far out of reach from their current situation. Each element is designed with clarity, positivity and a sense of familiarity in mind. This creates a solution that fits within the Jet2 ecosystem and helps each customer easily transition into a new airline class, giving them their first taste of flying VIP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693801fbdbcf10_YG19_Airline_Project_ConnorFowler_Page_2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A collection of small and large format luggage tags showcasing the new Jet2vip branding.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I felt my intentions for this project were good. My strategy was heading in the right direction but, unfortunately my execution of the designs and presentation felt lacklustre. This was due to largely being overloaded with client work and poor scheduling at the time. I knew when I submitted the project it wasn’t my best work but I had no more time to improve on it. Young Guns was always more about learning and feedback than being a “winner” so I am not disappointed with the project because I now know where to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Find Me:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://connorfowler.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://connorfowler.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://instagram.com/cfowlerdesign&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://instagram.com/cfowlerdesign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/cfowlerdesign&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/cfowlerdesign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://connorfowler.com/the-fowler-hour&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://connorfowler.com/the-fowler-hour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938004bdbcf12_sharif-Elkomi.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384bc2dbcf11_Boarding-Pass.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Boarding pass&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Overall Idea&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to capture the essence of “Swiss” as it exists in our collective subconscious. The brand, in my mind, had to be obvious but also subtle enough to look premium on application. I wanted people who flew Crimson to be able to be able to use whatever they were given on the plane later on because it feels and looks premium enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693836eddbcf15_Uniform-Concept.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Uniform concept&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938630ddbcf13_Crew-Uniform.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Crew uniform&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was difficult to balance clean minimal design while communicating a premium feel. It was also very challenging working on applications I’ve never dealt with before such as the boarding pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381d22dbcf17_Cabin-Menu.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Cabin Menu&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary of Design Solution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I designed what I see as a very simple flexible mark essentially designed with applications in mind. It works on billboards, printed on the menu, small, big, embroidered; that was the idea. Visually, the royal blue accent complemented the crimson color nicely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269380415dbcf14_Tag.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Luggage tag&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This project was the most fun I’ve had on the Young Guns, it was challenging and I definitely felt like I had to pull out all the tricks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Find Me:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Behance – &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.behance.net/sharifelkomi&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;https://www.behance.net/sharifelkomi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269380e1cdbcf16_Spencer-fraye.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693849a6dbcf20_Stylescape-Final-1200x360.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A stylescape to help showcase the brand aura and general feeling.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Overall Idea&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall goal of the project was to imagine what a premium/VIP class would be for the German Airline Lufthansa. My approach to the project was to use a faithful design language and geometric similarities to tie the two brands together visually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269389b91dbcf18_Baggage-drop-off.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Signage to help customers navigate the airport.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693808ebdbcf19_Metallic-Extrusion.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A 3D extruded sign showing the mark in different materials.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Challenges&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges of the project was weighing the differences between a premium-feeling brand, faithful design, and appropriate cultural style. Because Lufthansa is already a very premium-feeling brand, trying to ‘level up’ the brand was a challenge in and of itself. I ended up using a cooler and richer color palette paired with didot as a typeface to create a premium feeling brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938659ddbcf1a_Nest-Bag.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A travel bag showcasing what the “Nest” Identity would look like in context.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693856dedbcf1b_Signage.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A promotional sign to help customers feel at home with the brand.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938195adbcf1c_Logo-Geometry-_-Origin.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;A visualization to help personnel see the transformation between the established brand and the new variant.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Summary of Design Solution&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest challenges I faced was in finding a suitable name for the brand. Because Lufthansa is a German airline with a German name, finding something that would work in both German and English was definitely a challenge. My solution was the name “Nest”, which is a word that works in both English and German. Everything beyond that just fell in to place, the brand atmosphere, the colors, typography. The other big problem was in weighing the differences between this VIP class and the larger airline brand. The goal was to create something distinct and uniquely better, but something that didn’t deviate too far from the brand. The ultimate product was something that I believe to be an elegant and minimalist solution to accompany an already powerful, established brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269387797dbcf1d_Wordmark-Icon.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;The final Logomark.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Closing Thoughts&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young Guns has given me not only the practical and tangible skills needed in my career, but also the general mindset and approach I need to have going forward in my career. Young Guns has done a brilliant job of creating an environment for people like me to fail, experiment, play, and learn. I have grown so incredibly much from this experience, I am beyond thankful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Find Me:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;@spencerfraye (twitter, instagram, facebook)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Young Guns Series 1 was a chance for 5 designers from across the globe to participate in a design mentorship program with Chris Do. They had the opportunity to learn the fundamentals of graphic design and business mindset through a series of challenges and coaching calls.

    <title>How to Find Bigger Clients When You’re On Upwork</title>
    <updated>2019-04-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2019-04-08:/blog/find-bigger-clients-when-on-upwork-ben-burns</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us, myself included, got our start with Upwork (well, it was oDesk back then). When you’re trying to find your feet, sometimes the easiest way seems like the best way. But sadly that’s not always the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upwork sure makes it sound appealing though. The clients are all there, they’ve outlined exactly what they want so you can quickly decide if you’re a good fit for the job, and they’ve even told you how much they expect to pay. Seems like an ideal situation, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost like going fishing at the aquarium: everything is transparent and everyone is on the same playing field. But after a few projects, Upwork begins to become uncomfortable, and you realize…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ll never make enough money on upwork.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s sad. But it’s true. Let’s revisit the fishing metaphor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yep, it’s like fishing in an aquarium, but you and every other person out there knows about it! Those fish are presented with so much bait, they can easily pick the one that:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;will hurt the least (cheapest)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;they’ve had before (the job was never actually open)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;they saw first&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;stands out the most&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;So that initial thought of “wow, this is so easy and great” suddenly gets washed away when you realize that your application might be trashed because the client only viewed applications until they discovered the first decent profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The client might not even view your profile because they spotted a name they recognized from a previous project, or worse – choose the cheapest option despite that person’s skillset compared to yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about things on the other side? I don’t know if you’ve ever used UpWork to hire someone, but let me assure you: it sucks. I posted a job looking for a copywriter once and had over 1,000 applicants. OVER ONE THOUSAND. I was amazed that many of them had no experience, no portfolio, and could barely stitch a sentence together. These applicants had made it through Upworks vigorous ‘data science’ and landed straight into my inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSfebOXSBOE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mind bottling&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t it? Just when you have faith in the system that good work will get its chance if you do your best, you’re not even considered for the first hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we’ve established that Upwork is no place for professionals like you…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you find bigger clients outside of Upwork?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s tough. At least to start – don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. But there’s faith. Finding bigger clients is absolutely doable with some hard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps to learn a little about consumer psychology here. Your Upwork client probably was drawn to that platform for one of a few reasons, such as they have no idea where else to look for service providers. They could scour the internet for hours searching for good freelancers, or they could simply log on to Upwork and check out their extensive list all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, they may want to find a deal, or can’t afford industry-accepted rates for professional design. Most people, including clients, want to feel as though they’re getting good deals worth for their budget without doing bad business. Which brings us into our last reason. They might be worried about scams or getting screwed over. There’s a certain level of safety in doing your business through a third-party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you ask me, they’re all pretty awful ways to start a professional relationship. So let’s take a look at some of the reasons why bigger clients choose the designers they work with…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They might have previously worked with the designer, or know someone who has worked with them in the past. Perhaps they met the designer in person or discovered them via social media due to their large following. Or maybe they looked at the designer’s portfolio, appreciated their work and envisioned their style successfully pulling off the work that they want doing for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This list is by no means complete, but you can start to see the difference. Most of these are based around trust. Trust in the designer showing up for work, fulfilling their duties and doing so in a way that merges with the client. The underlying cause for the purchase decision is the same, but their results and actions vary wildly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what’s the one takeaway here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigger clients buy assurance, and they don’t look for it on sites like Upwork.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assurance is everything to a high-paying client. Assurance is the key to find bigger clients and land bigger jobs. What does that mean? Bigger design clients are looking for you to be able to assure them that you’ll hit three major points when you get the job done; they need to know you can complete it to their standard, on time and in budget. When you put your name forward to apply for a job, communicating that you can match these three criteria is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now we’re sure your targets are set on landing bigger clients, so let’s take a look at a simple four-step process to get on their radar and connect with them. Note — we could probably write an encyclopedia on each of these steps, but for the purpose of this article, let’s take a macro view of this flow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Define who you want to work with&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step is key, and not many people do it well. It’s hard to pinpoint your ideal client when you feel as though any well-paying work would suffice. Take the time to tap into what really interests you, what your passions are and your beliefs. Don’t underestimate how much enjoying the work and connecting with it on a personal level of interest can influence the final outcome. If you’re still stuck for ideas you could look at your hobbies and see how they could influence the clients you approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, let’s say you’re a craft beer enthusiast — what would stop you from working with a local brewery? Plot out an entire list of breweries, bars, and burger joints in your area. Then learn a little about the corporate leadership and company structure. Who’s responsible for the brand image? Who’s responsible for purchasing media or marketing materials?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done that, figure out all the ways you can make these people aware that you exist. Look up examples of a consumer journey and use a combination of your knowledge and common sense to plot out a journey for each type of business that you want to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Get positioned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second step for a reason. You should mirror who your desired customers are and what they need. Tesla may be a great car, but they’d have a tough time selling to someone shopping for an ATV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to decide who your target client is before positioning yourself because otherwise, you’ll cast a wider net in hopes of trying to please everyone. If you’re positioning yourself as a freelancer, I highly recommend developing a very niche style and service offering. In other words, don’t have a website that offers or displays web design, character design, illustration, print work, and kinetic typography in one place. Someone who is looking for an expert will see this and run far, far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been stood in a grocery store looking for something simple and been bombarded with choice? Sometimes offering a selective number of things, and proving you’re great at every single one, outshines saying you’re capable of doing twenty things – and this is one of those times. If you’re positioning yourself as an agency, or as a “we,” you have a little more leeway, but definitely stick to a defined group of services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want a client to come onto your website and see a little of what they’re about. Does your website reflect your vertical? Does it reflect WHO you want to work with? This is where you sell assurance. If they can see a similar color-palette as their own or a similar style of work that they’re used to, then they will feel more comfortable trusting you to produce their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure where to start with this, consider these three questions first:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have great examples of only your best work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does your website have grammatical errors? (Always a big no-no)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have references and testimonials available and visible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Be visible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within your customer journey, you should have identified several opportunities to increase your business’ awareness. Now is the time to take action on these items. Gaining visibility will differ from business to business, but your main focus should be on social media, branding, and SEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crafting a specialized Instagram account, actually GOING to those burger joints and breweries and talking to the staff, connecting with leadership over LinkedIn (without overselling, people, c’mon), being active in local small business groups, or competing in award shows are all good ways to increase awareness for your practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traction is a great book to read for awareness ideas — they claim there are 19 channels for lead generation. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591848369/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1591848369&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=mrbenburns0a-20&amp;amp;linkId=b99f333ce7f0e27062d26a0bc44898f4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Check it out here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Connect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you’ve run your passive awareness efforts, it’s time for some hand-to-hand combat. Pick five of the people you listed in the first step and buckle your seatbelt. I’m going to suggest something that will go against every one of your designerly instincts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invite them to lunch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or coffee. Or for a beer. Just invite them out to connect. No strings attached, no sales pitch. Just say you’re new in town/in business/to their shop, and that you’d LOVE to pick their brains for some knowledge. It’s as simple as that. You can shoot them a three line email, or send them a tweet, or even stop by their business and invite them in person. However, you do it, be cordial, friendly, and reassure them that you’re not there to sell them. People hate that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This really is part of the awareness phase, and it’s almost like a cold call, but if you have no agenda, it takes the pressure off of both of you. When you sit down with them, just ask questions. How did they get their logo done? Who do they work with for packaging? What’s the worst part of their job? Show genuine interest and it will be reciprocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you may not get work right off the bat. But if you continue to sit down with people, your name will start to pop up in industry conversations. You’ll be amazed when that first massive design job lands at your feet how far that one connection went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If casually meeting a prospective client doesn’t come naturally to you – and don’t worry, it doesn’t to many of us – then fear not. We’ve released the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/resources/first-meeting-workbook&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;First Meeting Worksheet&lt;/a&gt; which is absolutely free and all it requires is for you to fill in the blanks. Whether you’re going into your first meeting without a sales pitch or you’re ready to tell them what you can do, this downloadable worksheet will walk you through every step so you can remain cool, calm, collected and of course, yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The silver bullet doesn’t exist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t any ONE proven way to find bigger clients. Finding high-paying design clients, as in any other sale, is all about people. Brainstorm and follow a customer/consumer journey, and make every effort to genuinely connect with other humans who are positioned to help you grow. It’s even better if you can offer them value immediately, even if it is simply in the form of stimulating conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Already have a meeting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, congrats! Good job. Without the structure you’re used to from sites like Upwork, nailing that first client meeting can be a little stressful. Don’t worry – it will go away with practice. But in the meantime, we recommend a specific format to that first client meeting. That’s why we’ve put together &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/resources/first-meeting-workbook&#34;&gt;The First Meeting Worksheet.&lt;/a&gt; This will walk you through that first meeting step by step, and give you the right question to ask. &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/resources/first-meeting-workbook&#34;&gt;Best of all, it’s FREE.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385055dbce27_image-blog-The-Futur-First-Meeting-Worksheet-Inside.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

These applicants had made it through Upworks vigorous ‘data science’ and landed straight into my inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSfebOXSBOE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mind bottling&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t it? Just when you have faith in the system that good work will get its chance if you do your best, you’re not even considered for the first hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we’ve established that Upwork is no place for professionals like you…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you find bigger clients outside of Upwork?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it’s tough. At least to start – don’t let anyone tell you otherwise. But there’s faith. Finding bigger clients is absolutely doable with some hard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps to learn a little about consumer psychology here. Your Upwork client probably was drawn to that platform for one of a few reasons, such as they have no idea where else to look for service providers. They could scour the internet for hours searching for good freelancers, or they could simply log on to Upwork and check out their extensive list all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, they may want to find a deal, or can’t afford industry-accepted rates for professional design. Most people, including clients, want to feel as though they’re getting good deals worth for their budget without doing bad business. Which brings us into our last reason. They might be worried about scams or getting screwed over. There’s a certain level of safety in doing your business through a third-party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you ask me, they’re all pretty awful ways to start a professional relationship. So let’s take a look at some of the reasons why bigger clients choose the designers they work with…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They might have previously worked with the designer, or know someone who has worked with them in the past. Perhaps they met the designer in person or discovered them via social media due to their large following. Or maybe they looked at the designer’s portfolio, appreciated their work and envisioned their style successfully pulling off the work that they want doing for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This list is by no means complete, but you can start to see the difference. Most of these are based around trust. Trust in the designer showing up for work, fulfilling their duties and doing so in a way that merges with the client. The underlying cause for the purchase decision is the same, but their results and actions vary wildly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what’s the one takeaway here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bigger clients buy assurance, and they don’t look for it on sites like Upwork.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assurance is everything to a high-paying client. Assurance is the key to find bigger clients and land bigger jobs. What does that mean? Bigger design clients are looking for you to be able to assure them that you’ll hit three major points when you get the job done; they need to know you can complete it to their standard, on time and in budget. When you put your name forward to apply for a job, communicating that you can match these three criteria is key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now we’re sure your targets are set on landing bigger clients, so let’s take a look at a simple four-step process to get on their radar and connect with them. Note — we could probably write an encyclopedia on each of these steps, but for the purpose of this article, let’s take a macro view of this flow:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Define who you want to work with&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step is key, and not many people do it well. It’s hard to pinpoint your ideal client when you feel as though any well-paying work would suffice. Take the time to tap into what really interests you, what your passions are and your beliefs. Don’t underestimate how much enjoying the work and connecting with it on a personal level of interest can influence the final outcome. If you’re still stuck for ideas you could look at your hobbies and see how they could influence the clients you approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, let’s say you’re a craft beer enthusiast — what would stop you from working with a local brewery? Plot out an entire list of breweries, bars, and burger joints in your area. Then learn a little about the corporate leadership and company structure. Who’s responsible for the brand image? Who’s responsible for purchasing media or marketing materials?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve done that, figure out all the ways you can make these people aware that you exist. Look up examples of a consumer journey and use a combination of your knowledge and common sense to plot out a journey for each type of business that you want to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;2. Get positioned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second step for a reason. You should mirror who your desired customers are and what they need. Tesla may be a great car, but they’d have a tough time selling to someone shopping for an ATV.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You need to decide who your target client is before positioning yourself because otherwise, you’ll cast a wider net in hopes of trying to please everyone. If you’re positioning yourself as a freelancer, I highly recommend developing a very niche style and service offering. In other words, don’t have a website that offers or displays web design, character design, illustration, print work, and kinetic typography in one place. Someone who is looking for an expert will see this and run far, far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been stood in a grocery store looking for something simple and been bombarded with choice? Sometimes offering a selective number of things, and proving you’re great at every single one, outshines saying you’re capable of doing twenty things – and this is one of those times. If you’re positioning yourself as an agency, or as a “we,” you have a little more leeway, but definitely stick to a defined group of services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You want a client to come onto your website and see a little of what they’re about. Does your website reflect your vertical? Does it reflect WHO you want to work with? This is where you sell assurance. If they can see a similar color-palette as their own or a similar style of work that they’re used to, then they will feel more comfortable trusting you to produce their vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re not sure where to start with this, consider these three questions first:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have great examples of only your best work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does your website have grammatical errors? (Always a big no-no)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have references and testimonials available and visible?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Be visible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within your customer journey, you should have identified several opportunities to increase your business’ awareness. Now is the time to take action on these items. Gaining visibility will differ from business to business, but your main focus should be on social media, branding, and SEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crafting a specialized Instagram account, actually GOING to those burger joints and breweries and talking to the staff, connecting with leadership over LinkedIn (without overselling, people, c’mon), being active in local small business groups, or competing in award shows are all good ways to increase awareness for your practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traction is a great book to read for awareness ideas — they claim there are 19 channels for lead generation. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591848369/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1591848369&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=mrbenburns0a-20&amp;amp;linkId=b99f333ce7f0e27062d26a0bc44898f4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Check it out here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Connect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you’ve run your passive awareness efforts, it’s time for some hand-to-hand combat. Pick five of the people you listed in the first step and buckle your seatbelt. I’m going to suggest something that will go against every one of your designerly instincts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invite them to lunch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or coffee. Or for a beer. Just invite them out to connect. No strings attached, no sales pitch. Just say you’re new in town/in business/to their shop, and that you’d LOVE to pick their brains for some knowledge. It’s as simple as that. You can shoot them a three line email, or send them a tweet, or even stop by their business and invite them in person. However, you do it, be cordial, friendly, and reassure them that you’re not there to sell them. People hate that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This really is part of the awareness phase, and it’s almost like a cold call, but if you have no agenda, it takes the pressure off of both of you. When you sit down with them, just ask questions. How did they get their logo done? Who do they work with for packaging? What’s the worst part of their job? Show genuine interest and it will be reciprocated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, you may not get work right off the bat. But if you continue to sit down with people, your name will start to pop up in industry conversations. You’ll be amazed when that first massive design job lands at your feet how far that one connection went.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If casually meeting a prospective client doesn’t come naturally to you – and don’t worry, it doesn’t to many of us – then fear not. We’ve released the &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/resources/first-meeting-workbook&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;First Meeting Worksheet&lt;/a&gt; which is absolutely free and all it requires is for you to fill in the blanks. Whether you’re going into your first meeting without a sales pitch or you’re ready to tell them what you can do, this downloadable worksheet will walk you through every step so you can remain cool, calm, collected and of course, yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The silver bullet doesn’t exist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There isn’t any ONE proven way to find bigger clients. Finding high-paying design clients, as in any other sale, is all about people. Brainstorm and follow a customer/consumer journey, and make every effort to genuinely connect with other humans who are positioned to help you grow. It’s even better if you can offer them value immediately, even if it is simply in the form of stimulating conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Already have a meeting?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, congrats! Good job. Without the structure you’re used to from sites like Upwork, nailing that first client meeting can be a little stressful. Don’t worry – it will go away with practice. But in the meantime, we recommend a specific format to that first client meeting. That’s why we’ve put together &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/resources/first-meeting-workbook&#34;&gt;The First Meeting Worksheet.&lt;/a&gt; This will walk you through that first meeting step by step, and give you the right question to ask. &lt;a href=&#34;https://thefutur.com/resources/first-meeting-workbook&#34;&gt;Best of all, it’s FREE.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385055dbce27_image-blog-The-Futur-First-Meeting-Worksheet-Inside.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Going to prospective client meetings can be rough.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the past, my mindset going into prospective client meetings was:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;1. I have to prove that I’m smart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. I’ll avoid uncomfortable confrontation and be polite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. I need to educate the client so they know the value of my services.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem was that all of the pressure was on me. I avoided the dreadful &lt;em&gt;“what is your budget” &lt;/em&gt;discussion. And I looked desperate because I was always needing to validate my skills and prices. Most of the time I didn’t get what I wanted out of these meetings. I beat myself up for it, and rarely got the client’s business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;So what have I learned after many years of pitching and closing clients? I learned that you and your clients want to know the same things:&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Me: Can they afford me? Them: &lt;em&gt;Can I afford them?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;. Me: Can I do this (scope/timeline/expertise)? Them: &lt;em&gt;Can they do this?&lt;/em&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Me: What objections do they have working with me? Them: &lt;em&gt;I’m unsure if they…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269387203dbce2b_084-Sales-Call.041.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It all boils down to one thing. Is it a good mutual fit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693814d7dbce2a_084-Sales-Call.034.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;S&lt;strong&gt;o how do you run a successful sales call – where everyone gets what they want, you increase your chances of closing, and you have clarity moving forward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week I did a &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/AkHGk1l1Lx4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;live stream with Chris Do to share our five rules for running successful sales calls&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what we discussed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Talk about money early&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to say a price before you show a price.” As our good friend, Blair Enns would say. Don’t beat around the bush. By not talking about money, you are failing to answer the #1 question on both of your minds. Don’t delay the budget conversation by kicking it down the road. It’s important to have this conversation up front. (And no, it’s not rude or impolite to talk about money in the first meeting.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how you can use price anchoring and price bracketing to have the money conversation early on with clients:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/87CPZdh6FIc&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DjgVwN_k_88&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. S&lt;strong&gt;tyle is more important than substance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just what you say, it’s how you say it. People will remember how you made them feel long after they forget your words. People like others who are like themselves. So if you modulate your energy level to match the other person, you can easily build rapport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Robbins calls this “Match &amp;amp; Mirror.” If the other person speaks loudly and quickly, you should speak loudly and quickly. In this short video, Tony describes how you can build rapport with any kind of person:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9uHBEGpJm4&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Show. Don&amp;#39;t tell.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people incorrectly “educate” the client by describing and selling. They talk clients’ ears off about their services, and why they’re the right person for the job. Stop trying to “educate” your prospects. “Educe” is the root word of “educate,” and it means to draw out, not put in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than describing your services, you need to demonstrate your value. You do that by asking good questions, listening intently, and surfacing insights that weren’t apparent to them, prior to meeting you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how might you do this? In this video Chris demonstrates how to show, not tell:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cuy994Fs64&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Ask more questions.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever asks more questions is in control of the conversation. The quality of the questions you ask, determine your value. As we saw in the video above, by asking more questions, you help the prospect realize their own challenges and solutions. It’s a Socratic approach– allowing the other person to come to their own conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You aren’t selling anymore. Rather, in this process, you are able to demonstrate your value as an expert consultant to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in your next meeting, ask directed but open-ended questions that allow the other person to reveal insights on what would be helpful to them. These are much better than simple yes or no questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Build trust.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sales, the objective is to provide the client with information to help them make the best decision for them. You must remain neutral and unbiased. A fiduciary with their best interests in mind. Your goal is just to be helpful to them. This might mean that you aren’t the right person for the job. So you must be willing to walk away from the opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this might be odd to hear, but by doing this, you accomplish 2 very important things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The prospect now knows that you aren’t trying to force them to buy your product or service. You earn their trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. You are now in the position to say “no.” This gives you a lot of power in this client-vendor dynamic. You will not look desperate, because you don’t need this job. Pressure is taken off of the situation because neither of you has to make a potentially regretful choice then and there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you enter a sales meeting, just focus on being helpful to them. What do they need? How can you be of service to them even if it is against your best interest? Those are our five rules to run a successful sales call.

Is it a good mutual fit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693814d7dbce2a_084-Sales-Call.034.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;S&lt;strong&gt;o how do you run a successful sales call – where everyone gets what they want, you increase your chances of closing, and you have clarity moving forward?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week I did a &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/AkHGk1l1Lx4&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;live stream with Chris Do to share our five rules for running successful sales calls&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s what we discussed:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Talk about money early&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You have to say a price before you show a price.” As our good friend, Blair Enns would say. Don’t beat around the bush. By not talking about money, you are failing to answer the #1 question on both of your minds. Don’t delay the budget conversation by kicking it down the road. It’s important to have this conversation up front. (And no, it’s not rude or impolite to talk about money in the first meeting.) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how you can use price anchoring and price bracketing to have the money conversation early on with clients:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/87CPZdh6FIc&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/DjgVwN_k_88&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. S&lt;strong&gt;tyle is more important than substance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not just what you say, it’s how you say it. People will remember how you made them feel long after they forget your words. People like others who are like themselves. So if you modulate your energy level to match the other person, you can easily build rapport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tony Robbins calls this “Match &amp;amp; Mirror.” If the other person speaks loudly and quickly, you should speak loudly and quickly. In this short video, Tony describes how you can build rapport with any kind of person:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9uHBEGpJm4&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Show. Don&amp;#39;t tell.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most people incorrectly “educate” the client by describing and selling. They talk clients’ ears off about their services, and why they’re the right person for the job. Stop trying to “educate” your prospects. “Educe” is the root word of “educate,” and it means to draw out, not put in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rather than describing your services, you need to demonstrate your value. You do that by asking good questions, listening intently, and surfacing insights that weren’t apparent to them, prior to meeting you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how might you do this? In this video Chris demonstrates how to show, not tell:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cuy994Fs64&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Ask more questions.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whoever asks more questions is in control of the conversation. The quality of the questions you ask, determine your value. As we saw in the video above, by asking more questions, you help the prospect realize their own challenges and solutions. It’s a Socratic approach– allowing the other person to come to their own conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You aren’t selling anymore. Rather, in this process, you are able to demonstrate your value as an expert consultant to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in your next meeting, ask directed but open-ended questions that allow the other person to reveal insights on what would be helpful to them. These are much better than simple yes or no questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;5. Build trust.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sales, the objective is to provide the client with information to help them make the best decision for them. You must remain neutral and unbiased. A fiduciary with their best interests in mind. Your goal is just to be helpful to them. This might mean that you aren’t the right person for the job. So you must be willing to walk away from the opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know this might be odd to hear, but by doing this, you accomplish 2 very important things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The prospect now knows that you aren’t trying to force them to buy your product or service. You earn their trust.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. You are now in the position to say “no.” This gives you a lot of power in this client-vendor dynamic. You will not look desperate, because you don’t need this job. Pressure is taken off of the situation because neither of you has to make a potentially regretful choice then and there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next time you enter a sales meeting, just focus on being helpful to them. What do they need? How can you be of service to them even if it is against your best interest? Those are our five rules to run a successful sales call.

The content and opinions expressed below are that of The Futur.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joey Cofone is the CEO and co-founder of Baron Fig, a company that has succeeded by perfecting a simple tool crucial to the creative entrepreneur: the notebook. Launched in 2013 with a massively successful Kickstarter campaign, Baron Fig has gone on to expand its offerings and its business, but simplicity remains a common theme in both Joey’s business and his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/apuUYmUGKP0&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, a lot of Joey’s success comes from the fact that he knows what it’s like on the other side. As a child, he was adopted and lost his mother to cancer. He was adopted again, by his grandfather a master plumber who taught him hard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadly, Joey’s grandfather passed away when he was 17 and the moment he became a legal adult, he was kicked out of his home by his step-grandmother. Embarrassed and reluctant to ask for help, Joey spent a couple weeks sleeping in his car before his cousin noticed and took him in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These real-life experiences from his youth have led Joey to make big moves in his life, like giving up his fruitful freelance design career to start an unproven notebook company with his friend from college. Where others would consider such a thing too risky, Joey says, “If that’s the only thing that’s stopping me… then it’s not a fear I should give into.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joey’s risk paid off and he will continue to take big risks in the future. His journey from sleeping in his car to becoming an award-winning graphic designer and co-founder of a successful business wasn’t easy, and Joey quickly learned the value of &lt;strong&gt;simplifying&lt;/strong&gt; his business and staying &lt;strong&gt;focused&lt;/strong&gt; on his goals. When asked how he was able to keep his work life balanced yet productive, Joey shared the following tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Start at the end and work backwards&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381a4cdbce2f_Futur_joey01.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once Joey and his business partner figure out a goal, they work backwards to determine every step that needs to be taken to get them there. This allows them to be more goal-oriented and efficient with their time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Point. Don&amp;#39;t plan.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of having rigid deadlines (planning), Joey allows for some leeway. He knows life is unpredictable and you can’t account for everything. As long as he’s headed in the right direction, Joey has no problem adjusting his timetable accordingly and allowing himself to spend more time doing what’s important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Take mini-vacations&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385fb3dbce2e_TheFutur_Joey_vacation.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joey believes it’s important to have a life outside of the office, so he makes sure all his employees leave by 5. For Joey, getting a daily chance to refresh is more productive than working nonstop and then breaking for longer, less frequent periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;4. Y&lt;strong&gt;ou can’t delegate your biggest problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s ok not to have all the answers right away. As a small business owner, you may find yourself in a situation where you feel like you can’t figure it out. Joey reminds us that in those moments, you have to tell yourself you will figure it out, but you may not be in control of when you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent newlywed, outside the office, Joey is embarking on building a family of his own. He and his wife live by a new mantra – somewhat more genial than his grandfather’s adage: “We have everything we need to be happy.” Joey says that happiness is a choice, and though Baron Fig will continue to grow and bloom – just like the trees they plant in exchange for every sale of their signature notebook – he will continue to find pleasure in the simple joys of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to keep it simple for your business and maximize productivity, consider signing up for the all-new Chase Ink Business Unlimited credit card. With unlimited 1.5% cash back on every purchase, no annual fee, and no minimum balance to redeem rewards, the Chase Ink Business Unlimited credit card is a great choice for busy creative entrepreneurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chase.com/ink&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chase Ink&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>How to Prioritize for Productivity</title>
    <updated>2018-11-13T00:00:00Z</updated>

Here are some of the great tips Elay had to share:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Set small goals&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Elay, every day begins with one simple action: making the bed. Yes, even this little step provides a sense of accomplishment to start your day. It’s all about getting something done and moving on to the next task. Elay sets his days up as a series of goals, sometimes even dividing them up between the morning and afternoon. Thinking small allows you to move forward at a manageable pace instead of feeling overwhelmed by how much has to be done. Elay applies these same principles to his business by thinking of his annual targets in terms of monthly and quarterly objectives.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Double dip&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a CEO, author and father, Elay’s schedule is unsurprisingly jam-packed. In order to make the best use of his time, Elay likes to do two things at once whenever possible. For example, Elay often uses his morning run as a brainstorming session, choosing a topic to think about before he takes off. Even time spent on social media can be useful. When Elay was working on his new book, Enabling Mastery, he would test out his ideas while tweeting or in company blog posts, thereby writing while simultaneously promoting his company. Talk about killing two birds with one stone!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384180dbce33_Futur_Elay_02.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. P&lt;strong&gt;rioritize A.K.A don’t be afraid to say no!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful people are often asked for their time by people looking to follow in their footsteps. Elay says it’s been challenging, but he’s learned how to say no to that proverbial “cup of coffee” and instead offer to be helpful in a more concrete (and less time consuming) way like making an introduction or granting a specific request. When it comes to prioritizing his schedule, Elay likes to ask himself what will make a difference today and move those things to the top of the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elay Cohen has mastered the workday and his tips are priceless. But another thing that can help small business owners and creative professionals make the best use of their time is to find the right financial tools, like a simple small business credit card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One simple example is the Chase Ink Business Unlimited Credit Card.

    <title>How to Sell Strategy Without Design or Visuals</title>
    <updated>2018-08-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2018-08-26:/blog/how-to-sell-strategy-without-design-or-visuals</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this episode, Chris gives Melinda advice on how to explain strategy to potential clients and how to close the lead without using visuals to explain what you do. You can demonstrate the value of thinking by talking and listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKIyObgkBVI&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melinda Livsey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.marksandmaker.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Marks and Maker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;— [Transcription] —&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;@0:36 &lt;br/&gt;[Chris Do]: So now, we’re going to set some new benchmarks, and I’m going to give her some new tools. Sharpen those “P-shing!” Alright. Let’s do it! Let’s get into it. Alright. Fire away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Melinda Livsey]: You had mentioned in the last episode that I could have that whole conversation without visuals and I would like to hear how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@0:55&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Okay. So here’s the cool part: once you get into the thinking stage where you can charge for it, well thinking doesn’t have to have the traditional forms that making does. So making requires mock-ups, beautiful photography, great presentations. But thinking, you can demonstrate the value of thinking just by talking and listening. That you can do. So, we’re gonna do this where I’m gonna show you how to have this whole conversation without any visuals and feel fully confident without a website, without anything, you can do this. All you have to do is tell better stories. And, make analogies. Find metaphors. So this is where I may or may not have told you to do this already, but you kinda have to read some case studies so that you’re ready to talk about a lot of different things. Wherever the conversation goes, so this is where Bruce Lee says, “Be like water.” You wanna be like water. So I’m just controlling and directing energy so that when they push, I pull, and when they pull, I push, and so I’m always there when I’m not there–that kind of thing. This is getting into the whole zen of it. The first call typically is like, “Are they even qualified to be talking to me?” And that’s the right attitude to have. Are they qualified in the sense of, “Can they afford me? Do I align with their goals? Am I vibing with them? Is what they want realistic?” Because you can do it all, but if you need it done in two days, I’m not the right person for you. And that’s totally okay. And we’re doing it without judgement. Okay? So this is kind of like, we’re going to enter into this stage where, give me this set-up, and you and I will play. How can we do this so that you feel like this is close to your experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@2:41 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Well, being that this conversation is not close to my experience, it would be just someone calling me–are we talking about, is this the qualifying call? What call is this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Any call you want. Any call where you’re going to have to explain to them what you do without visuals. Almost all of the business that I do is without visuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Um, let’s just say it is someone who wants…it’s a start-up (because I do have a lot of start-ups contacting me) that wants to come out with an app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Anything else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@3:15 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: And, they want a website, and they want branding. And let’s just say they have the framework of their app done by a developer. So now they realize, “Oh! It doesn’t look good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right. They’ve done the UX part, but they haven’t done the UI part. Okay. Alright, so, do we begin the conversation at the beginning? Is this our second call–you let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uhhh, I would, in my–in the way I do it, it would be the second call after I have qualified them with, let’s say, the timeline and price, and goals. Like, the overarching goal. Do we vibe? So this would be the one, let’s say the “sales” one, like, to close the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh. That’s very interesting. Usually I do all the closing at the first call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay, then let’s make it that call!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Can we do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah! ‘Cause I’m learning here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So, this’ll be call “one and a half.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@4:05 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Basically you’re gonna take the second call and you’re going to smash it into their first call. So what we’re looking for are kinds of micro-engagements, like microtransactions to gain trust and to build trust. So when we’re talking to them, I’m very deliberate and intentional in terms of the words that I choose and how I describe what it is that we do. Because that’s your best opportunity to establish who you are and what you’re gonna do for your client. So go ahead: Set it up! We’re gonna talk. The phone rings. You call me or I call you? You call me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I call you because…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right. That’s how it works. Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: You’re gonna teach me this, right? [Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@4:44 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Hey, Chris. I saw your work. I have an app and I already have the framework done and I got the UX done, but I need a website. It looks horrible, so I need branding, and…I’d love to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Great! Fantastic! First of all, thank you for calling. Before I dive into all the deliverables and things of that nature, I’m curious what you saw or why you decided to reach out to me in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Um, I reached out to you because our mutual friend referred me to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh. Kelly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah! Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Love Kelly! I’m gonna have to send her a little thank you note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Alright, that’s great! Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Mutual friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: She told me that I should talk to you because I was telling her about where we’re at and that I was looking for someone, and then your name came up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@5:25 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Okay. Perfect. So I just want to let you know (And we’re having this just as a verbal conversation, alright? So I’m not even gonna look at Melinda. It’s just, it’s a telephone conversation.) I just wanna let you know that a lot of clients come to me and ask me to do things and I’m thrilled to do them. The thing is, I’m successful at doing these things because I have a framework that I use and if you’re open to this, [then] I would like to describe it a little bit to you, to see if it’s something that you would like to have done as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@5:53 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: So essentially what we do is we do discovery, and in the discovery we try to learn about not so much you and your company brand, but more importantly, who your customers and users are. We want to understand their pain points, their challenges…um, the jobs that they’re trying to do. What a win looks like, what a fail costs them, we want to understand not just the demographics, but the psychographics. This is what we can learn. When we figure out what they want, and we give the users what they want. We typically help our clients grow and succeed. Whether that’s an adoption of an app, or the usability of a website, and that’s really what’s driving all the aesthetic decisions that we make. Now for that, we typically charge anywhere between five to ten thousand dollars to do the strategy work itself. I say this upfront because it may not be a good fit for you. And that is exclusive of any deliverables. And then through the discovery phase, we learn about what you’re trying to accomplish, how you want to do it, whether or not you need a social media marketing campaign, all these other kind of things, and then we kind of budget together with you, and you can hire whoever you want. I get paid mostly to do the thinking part, and then whether or not you want to hire our firm to do the rest of the deliverables, it’s entirely up to you. How does that sound?&lt;br/&gt; @7:12 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: That sounds good. Do you have any idea of what the rest of the deliverables might cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@7:20 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Yes, I have a range, and, please don’t quote me on this, but if we’re talking about a website, to design and develop a website for you, based on the little that I know about you already, it’s going to be between 20 to 30 thousand dollars, including development. It will be a WordPress site, where you will be able to manage the content itself. It will be a custom theme that we build for you. Um, in terms of the identity, we can design the logo for 10K, and to design 3 pieces of collateral, usually a business card, an email signature, some–whatever else you think you need, that’s probably an additional 10,000 dollars, but I want to warn you, usually the website is the one that has the most range because of features and functions that you want to add to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@8:06 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Okay. Well, I’m interested in moving forward. What would be the next steps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@8:10 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Okay. So, what I can do is I can send you a deck that will outline our process so that you have something more concrete (I don’t know if this is something that you need to share with your team. I want to make sure that everyone feels good about doing this, because once we get into the discover phase, we’ll need to align all of the stakeholders.). So I’ll send you a deck and if that feels good, it will have an outline of a budget and timeline. That would be the next step. And then we can arrange a call to go over the proposal that I send you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay. Sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Is that cool?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. You’re like being too easy on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: No, I’m not. I’m learning. Because I’m taking…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You’re taking notes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@8:53 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Yeah, I’m taking notes because I want to say that we’re essentially not doing exactly the same thing, but you’re right how you took the two meetings and you’re putting them into one. When I said “case studies,” I did mean “process.” As in, I’m showing (what I’m saying is a “case study”) is it’s the strategy roadmap that I walk them through, so I’m essentially doing everything that you’re doing, minus the proposal, because at that second meeting, they say, “Yes, let’s move forward.” Then we move straight to [the] contract and invoice. So, we’re kinda doing a similar thing except you’re condensing it even shorter, except then, there is work in the backend to do. But you use a template, I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@9:33 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: We use a template and you usually shuffle around a few projects to make sure they feel like, “Yeah. These are in alignment with what I want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@9:41 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Now most of the time, it never goes that smoothly where I just say that and they’re like, “Great! Here’s all the money in the world!” There’s usually a little push-back here and there, and we didn’t get to explore that. But I just want to move the conversation tighter, so the next time it’s proposals, we’ll review it, and then after that it’s contracts. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah, I still don’t see the–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: There are no visuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: The big advantage of…What’s the biggest advantage of moving from what I’m doing currently to what you’re saying?&lt;br/&gt; @10:14 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Well, to be honest, if you had said that everything sounds great, I’d just send you no proposal–I mean, no work, I would just send you the budget and timeline, because you already bought in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: But that doesn’t usually happen, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@10:24 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: It never happens. I’m sorry. Let me restate: It almost never happens. It has happened to use before. Where I’m literally driving in from home to work, and I’m closing a hundred-thousand dollar job in my car because I wasn’t even thinking it was a real job: “And yes, this sounds great. We’ll start the schedule Fri–I’ll coordinate with the executive team to come out to Los Angeles to come and work with you.” And I said, “Okay, great. I’ll send you a budget.” So I went in, talked to my executive producer at that time, and I said, “Hey! We need to send an invoice for an estimate, and I want nothing else except for the price.” You describe it exactly the way I say it and you put a price because, at this point, what you don’t want to do is go past the sale. Once the client says, “I agree. A hundred thousand bucks. Let’s do it.” I don’t send anything else because they might see something that confuses them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So we would be able to skip that step. So in this roleplay, I volunteered to send you a deck that I shouldn’t have, so that was my bad. Because you didn’t even ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right. I would normally ask for it. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, you would normally ask for it. Yeah. I was prepared for you to ask for it, so, it was kinda in the typical scenario to…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: My brain was full, so I was…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s okay. So that’s why I’m like, “Yeah, boom. There it is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right. So I’m doing the…essentially when you’re showing them something visually, and you’re saying it to them, and possibly having a follow-up call, I’m condensing that into a meeting whereby the end of it they’re saying, “Yes. Let’s go.” And then I skip the sending of the proposal and go straight to the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. We might be nerding out a little bit too much here for people to understand exactly what the heck we’re doing. The point is, you should be–honestly, I could stand in a room with you, all day long, with no visuals, and still close the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: But you’re still having to send the proposal, with the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@12:05 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Well, if necessary, I would send no proposal. If you want me to roleplay that, I could do that, but I’m just saying: All these things are, uh, in a way, crutches. Really, your mind is what they’re paying for, so you should be able to describe what you do and how you do it. Without any visual, without any deck. The deck is just to back-up what you said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I will be working on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, well, you already have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah. It’s just reshuffling what, how I approach it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@12:37 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Yeah. And I think, if anything, what you wanna do is describe the process in simpler, like more bite-sized pieces because the brain can only hold so much, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And so, only give them more information as they need it. So like, try to like, look at it like this is a block of marble, and then we make some kind of broad chips away at it, and then it kinda looks like a human, and they’re like, “Yeah, yeah. That’s what we really want. But what does the head look like?” And then you chisel away so that it starts to look like it’s a man and not a woman, or it’s a soldier, or a general, it’s old or young, whatever. So I only dive into it as I feel like it’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So the ability to expand and contract is very dynamic, so if you want more information, then I will expand it. If you don’t, [then] I close it. And it’s just being able to move and manage energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, now, what else do we need to talk about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: The quoting of “I’m so focused on strategy,” which is good because it set me on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Now the pricing of the deliverables, or everything that comes after that, I’m stumbling because I don’t, I didn’t even think about that part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. That’s okay. So you’ve seen as a member of the pro-group, you’ve seen our price sheet. It’s in there somewhere. Have you seen that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I have to look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, it’s in there. Yeah, it’s in there. We put together an old price sheet of like, the deliverables and some of them have really big ranges like the website. Some of them are much more contained because we know what it’s going to take for us to produce a logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@14:10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Now I’m getting all this work and a lot of leads, and now it is developing a structure to my business and systems and the process and like a very solid framework so that I can even see how much I can take on and when I need to hire people and when there’s a bottleneck, I’m in that growing pains place where I have a lot of work, but I need to know how, how can I not grow so fast that I can’t support all that work and hit the timelines and take on multiple things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Do you feel stressed out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I don’t feel stressed out. I feel, I feel like I’m being stretched. That hurts sometimes, but I wouldn’t say it’s stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Are you working into the wee hours of the night?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@14:53 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Okay, time to get help. I told you before: Do not hire anybody, but I think it’s time to hire somebody. Now, I don’t mean to hire somebody like full-time and all that kind of stuff. I think you need a roster of a couple of people that you can call that are semi-available, and you just move through those people, and they understand your process and how do what you do. Ideally right now, in the next phase of your growth for 2018, what I want you to do is to focus on doing strategy, continue to refine it, on-board clients at a higher rate, so just start to move that rate higher and higher, so now that you’ve been able to close a few of these strategic engagements at 5 thousand bucks, I would say it’s the time to move to 10. I want you to move to 10, and you’ll get a little pushback, and then you’ll just get to 10, okay? And then as you settle into 10, the next thing will be from 10 to 20. You just keep doing that, keep doubling it. When you are able to charge that much for strategy, then you can afford to hire lots of different kinds of people and you know that the deliverables are kind of relative to this strategic part. Meaning that a client that’s going to nickel and dime you at 2 thousand dollars for design work is never going to agree to pay you 5 for discovery alone. Because they don’t value thinking. So this is a great filter. This is a great qualifier. If they’re not on–if they’re not gonna come on board to do strategy with you, it means that they don’t value that kind of thinking. And a lot of you that are watching this right now, are going to say, “Yeah, I do brand strategy,” just like Melinda used to say to me. But when you really know how to do it (and I told you during that show: “One day you’ll see and you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about.” That day has come obviously and you see, and it’s a game changer), it changes the entire way that you think and how you work, and it almost is like you can’t do that dumb thing anymore. You can’t just move images around. You can’t just make shapes anymore. Because it seems frivolous at this point. So you’ve crossed over this threshold that you can’t go back on, which is wonderful and I’m glad to see you do this, right? So this is what (if you guys are watching), you do need to learn actually how to do this. You can’t just say the words. And the words that you use might actually be very different from the experience that she’s having. So why don’t we take a minute here to try to explain to people a little bit more finely “strategy before” and “strategy after,” according to Melinda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Oh, yeah. It’s a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Can you do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@17:21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah. “Strategy before” was me gathering all of the questions, um, in a questionnaire, that I needed…that I personally needed to design a logo, so that was asking a lot of similar questions to what I do now, but in a completely different way. One, it was homework for my client, so it was not a face-to-face meeting, there was no trust being built during that time. I’ve definitely realized that being face-to-face with my client in the workshop meetings changes everything. They actually trust you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And who told you that wise piece of advice? [Laughter.] Yes, I did. I did. You set yourself up, but, okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It’s true, it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@18:03&lt;br/&gt; [C]: And why does–what’s the difference when you’re doing face-to-face. A lot of people will think: “If it’s the same question, what is the value of face-to-face?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It’s soooo different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Tell us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@18:15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: In the questionnaire, it was “the question.” And I might follow-up with their answer, depending on what their answer was if I didn’t understand…um, in the workshop, I can dig deeper into things (I’m trying to find golden nuggets). I’m trying to find golden nuggets that are, um, unique to them, unique to their ideal client, and then start making connections and so that my questionnaire before reached like, surface-level, like enough to get an “okay” logo out of it, and now we’re digging so deep that…to the things that will actually make the difference and truly connecting to the ideal client, whereas the other, it was just enough to get a good logo out of it. But it didn’t mean that it was connecting with our ideal client, so I’m able to ask deep questions, I’m able to make connections, and then I’m also able to help facilitate my own clients’ thinking, so then I see them light up because they say, “Oh my gosh! I just realized something about my business!” Or, “I just realized that I need to change my services!” One client actually changed her services, and she pivoted her whole business based off of our conversation during strategy–which that would not happen during a questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@19:20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. I’m gonna show you guys an example. Melinda! We’re gonna order lunch today from Tender Greens. What would you like to eat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: What kind of salad?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: The Caesar salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Caesar salad. Uhh, you want bread with that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. And do you want soup?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Soup. And, vegetable soup is okay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Now what was I doing? I was literally an “order-taker.” And that’s what the questionnaire does. It sets you up to be the person to receive direction from your client, and there was no dialogue. Okay. Let’s try this again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@20:01&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Melinda, are you hungry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Very.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mmm. Would you like to get something to eat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes, I would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Do you have any kind of dietary restrictions? Are you in the mood for something?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uhh, anything that has cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You love cheese?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I love cheese, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Any kind of specific cheese?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@20:24&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Umm, mozzarella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mozzarella. Any other things I need to know about any dietary preferences? Are you like, allergic to gluten? Are you like on a fish diet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I don’t really like fish too much, so I like to avoid that,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, no fish. So you like mozzarella cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Anything else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Umm…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Are you trying to achieve any kind of fitness or health goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Just satisfy my hunger at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So, what is important to you then is that it gives good portions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I want really good food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Good food?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I want really good food. Like I wanna leave there just so happy that I ate at that restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:01&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Oh. Have you ever had an experience like this somewhere else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I have, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Where?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M] “Club 33,” Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: “Club 33?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I remember leaving there just so happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: What did you order?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I ordered a filet mignon. I ordered probably something with cheese. I ordered (Gosh, there was like seven courses. I don’t remember.). I just remember leaving happy. That’s what I want. I want to leave happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:30&lt;br/&gt; [C]: I’m curious. Was being inside Disneyland a part of the experience, or was it just–were we just talking about the food?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:31&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Uh, it was part of the experience, but the food was just overarching. But yes, it made the experience really good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:39&lt;br/&gt; [C]: And, can we try to break it up between how much of it was being in Disneyland and how much of it was the food, like on a scale of like 1 to 10, how much of that 10 would you give out to the experience versus the quality of the food?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:57&lt;br/&gt; [M]: I think it was 40% experience, 60% food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:58&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Oh, okay. This is very important. Because initially I thought maybe I can just send somebody out to pick it up and bring it here, but then you would be only getting 60, and 60% in my book is like a “D.” For grading, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah, sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: 60% is a “D.” It’s like one letter away from an “F.” Why don’t we just do this? Let’s go there. Let me call an Über, let’s get you some tickets, and let’s get inside Disneyland, and let’s just have that meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@22:21 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: I would love that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Let’s do it! Okay, and so that–I wanna stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Now I’m hungry!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It does nothing for me because I have no idea what “Club 33” is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It’s so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@22:34&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay! So in one way, I’m just listening and just writing down what she wants. In another way, I’m really trying to surface what she really wants. And I’m trying to understand something. Now, I want Melinda to do this without any bias, like, trying to help me achieve a certain goal or not. In the first instance, maybe you felt like, attended to. You felt important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Because I was like, “I’m gonna take your order!” And you were like, “Yeah! Cool! But, tell me how you felt about the second approach and what that was doing to you on a psychological, emotional level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@23:04&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I was literally imagining myself sitting there and eating the food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: And so I was feeling already the feelings I would have when I’m sitting there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: That’s part of it–that’s a big part of it actually. I didn’t feel anything. I felt important when you asked me those questions as far as the order taking, but, I was…I was enjoying the thought of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@23:28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Here’s the difference, really: First, I could’ve just gotten you something with mozzarella and you would be fine. And you just wanted to be full, so I could’ve gotten you lots of different meals, but then I got us to the perfect meal. The one that matters the most to you. And it takes time to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@23:45&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And, I could have also made a lot of assumptions when you said “Club 33.” I could have stopped there and just went out and got it. And not even help you to realize that it’s actually–40% of the experience is just being there, where you smelled the cotton candy or the vanilla, and it’s Mainstream USA and it kinda helps you to relive a childhood experience, so there’s a lot of connection to memory and celebration and ceremony that we won’t get just by giving you the plate of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@24:14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So, in the world of design, [let’s] bring it back to design for a second. There’s lots of logos that I could’ve given her, ones that she could’ve ordered and she could’ve said, “I want modern, sophisticated!” and that’s what the questionnaire would do for you. But once I enter into dialogue, I found that there is a preference when, when she can choose anything, she chooses to have mozzarella and I could’ve gotten that from lots of different places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@24:35&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And then when we got a little bit close, she’s describing this certain kind of design, or something that she wants and not even realizing it, that there’s more to that than just that thing that we’re gonna make. So I’m able to surface something much deeper inside of her that gets really close to what she wants. And generally speaking, when you do that with people, they get the feels. Like, “Wow! Somebody has taken the time to kinda understand me. To really take the time to understand me.” And it takes more time. And that’s why people give you a hug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@25:11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s why people change their whole business models, because you helped them to realize something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And that is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Now, I will send you a bill for 10,000 dollars [laughter] to help you realize what that meal means to you. Is that cool? That’s the most expensive filet mignon you’ve ever had in your life. You’re like: “I’m not paying you for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@25:32&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Now, unfortunately–or, fortunately, actually, think about this: When Melinda speaks to her next prospective vendor, she’s going to be comparing the feelings that she got versus how they made her feel. THis is why, when you do this correctly, you should have almost no competition. Because she’s going to walk away like, “Oh, yeah. I have to call these 2 more vendors to make sure. And vendor number one won’t give her a questionnaire. It’s like, “Okay, we can do it. Here’s the price.” And then, vendor number 2 might ask some questions via a questionnaire, but they’re not going to go as deep as we just did. And I think that’s one of the key things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@26:16&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Right. I would also add…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: That there are some clients who desire the questionnaire, and desire to dictate everything, and I know that there is a way to pivot (I have learned that)…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: But, it’s not as easy as someone that does wanna be–like, that is more open to be understood. Obviously, there’s–it’s an easier entry point, but there are some clients that wanna go in and just dictate–like, the ones that just want the deliverable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@26:46&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Like the logo, and they won’t budge from that, and those are the ones that want the questionnaire, and they want the old Melinda, and they’re not gonna get the old Melinda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: They can’t have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: They can’t have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: She’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: She’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You make me proud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Thank you for watching and listening to me talk about food and cheese and, uh, Chris getting mad at me for giving one line in my…my uh (What is it?) “role play.” Which I hate. Hate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright you guys. Hopefully, hopefully you enjoyed this episode. Smash that “like” button and subscribe, and I wanna see more of Melinda and kinda track her progress as she continues to move up in the world. And I think probably, just (this is a pretty safe prediction) her next challenges will be to hire, to manage and build her team because she will not be able to keep up with the work. And that’s all I have for you guys, see you guys next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>How to Sell Strategy Without Design or Visuals</title>
    <updated>2018-08-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2018-08-26:/blog/how-to-sell-strategy-without-design-or-visuals</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this episode, Chris gives Melinda advice on how to explain strategy to potential clients and how to close the lead without using visuals to explain what you do. You can demonstrate the value of thinking by talking and listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKIyObgkBVI&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melinda Livsey&lt;br/&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.marksandmaker.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Marks and Maker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;— [Transcription] —&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;@0:36 &lt;br/&gt;[Chris Do]: So now, we’re going to set some new benchmarks, and I’m going to give her some new tools. Sharpen those “P-shing!” Alright. Let’s do it! Let’s get into it. Alright. Fire away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Melinda Livsey]: You had mentioned in the last episode that I could have that whole conversation without visuals and I would like to hear how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@0:55&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Okay. So here’s the cool part: once you get into the thinking stage where you can charge for it, well thinking doesn’t have to have the traditional forms that making does. So making requires mock-ups, beautiful photography, great presentations. But thinking, you can demonstrate the value of thinking just by talking and listening. That you can do. So, we’re gonna do this where I’m gonna show you how to have this whole conversation without any visuals and feel fully confident without a website, without anything, you can do this. All you have to do is tell better stories. And, make analogies. Find metaphors. So this is where I may or may not have told you to do this already, but you kinda have to read some case studies so that you’re ready to talk about a lot of different things. Wherever the conversation goes, so this is where Bruce Lee says, “Be like water.” You wanna be like water. So I’m just controlling and directing energy so that when they push, I pull, and when they pull, I push, and so I’m always there when I’m not there–that kind of thing. This is getting into the whole zen of it. The first call typically is like, “Are they even qualified to be talking to me?” And that’s the right attitude to have. Are they qualified in the sense of, “Can they afford me? Do I align with their goals? Am I vibing with them? Is what they want realistic?” Because you can do it all, but if you need it done in two days, I’m not the right person for you. And that’s totally okay. And we’re doing it without judgement. Okay? So this is kind of like, we’re going to enter into this stage where, give me this set-up, and you and I will play. How can we do this so that you feel like this is close to your experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@2:41 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Well, being that this conversation is not close to my experience, it would be just someone calling me–are we talking about, is this the qualifying call? What call is this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Any call you want. Any call where you’re going to have to explain to them what you do without visuals. Almost all of the business that I do is without visuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Um, let’s just say it is someone who wants…it’s a start-up (because I do have a lot of start-ups contacting me) that wants to come out with an app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Anything else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@3:15 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: And, they want a website, and they want branding. And let’s just say they have the framework of their app done by a developer. So now they realize, “Oh! It doesn’t look good.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right. They’ve done the UX part, but they haven’t done the UI part. Okay. Alright, so, do we begin the conversation at the beginning? Is this our second call–you let me know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uhhh, I would, in my–in the way I do it, it would be the second call after I have qualified them with, let’s say, the timeline and price, and goals. Like, the overarching goal. Do we vibe? So this would be the one, let’s say the “sales” one, like, to close the lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh. That’s very interesting. Usually I do all the closing at the first call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay, then let’s make it that call!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Can we do it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah! ‘Cause I’m learning here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So, this’ll be call “one and a half.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@4:05 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Basically you’re gonna take the second call and you’re going to smash it into their first call. So what we’re looking for are kinds of micro-engagements, like microtransactions to gain trust and to build trust. So when we’re talking to them, I’m very deliberate and intentional in terms of the words that I choose and how I describe what it is that we do. Because that’s your best opportunity to establish who you are and what you’re gonna do for your client. So go ahead: Set it up! We’re gonna talk. The phone rings. You call me or I call you? You call me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I call you because…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right. That’s how it works. Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: You’re gonna teach me this, right? [Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@4:44 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Hey, Chris. I saw your work. I have an app and I already have the framework done and I got the UX done, but I need a website. It looks horrible, so I need branding, and…I’d love to work with you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Great! Fantastic! First of all, thank you for calling. Before I dive into all the deliverables and things of that nature, I’m curious what you saw or why you decided to reach out to me in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Um, I reached out to you because our mutual friend referred me to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh. Kelly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah! Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Love Kelly! I’m gonna have to send her a little thank you note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Alright, that’s great! Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Mutual friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: She told me that I should talk to you because I was telling her about where we’re at and that I was looking for someone, and then your name came up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@5:25 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Okay. Perfect. So I just want to let you know (And we’re having this just as a verbal conversation, alright? So I’m not even gonna look at Melinda. It’s just, it’s a telephone conversation.) I just wanna let you know that a lot of clients come to me and ask me to do things and I’m thrilled to do them. The thing is, I’m successful at doing these things because I have a framework that I use and if you’re open to this, [then] I would like to describe it a little bit to you, to see if it’s something that you would like to have done as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@5:53 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: So essentially what we do is we do discovery, and in the discovery we try to learn about not so much you and your company brand, but more importantly, who your customers and users are. We want to understand their pain points, their challenges…um, the jobs that they’re trying to do. What a win looks like, what a fail costs them, we want to understand not just the demographics, but the psychographics. This is what we can learn. When we figure out what they want, and we give the users what they want. We typically help our clients grow and succeed. Whether that’s an adoption of an app, or the usability of a website, and that’s really what’s driving all the aesthetic decisions that we make. Now for that, we typically charge anywhere between five to ten thousand dollars to do the strategy work itself. I say this upfront because it may not be a good fit for you. And that is exclusive of any deliverables. And then through the discovery phase, we learn about what you’re trying to accomplish, how you want to do it, whether or not you need a social media marketing campaign, all these other kind of things, and then we kind of budget together with you, and you can hire whoever you want. I get paid mostly to do the thinking part, and then whether or not you want to hire our firm to do the rest of the deliverables, it’s entirely up to you. How does that sound?&lt;br/&gt; @7:12 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: That sounds good. Do you have any idea of what the rest of the deliverables might cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@7:20 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Yes, I have a range, and, please don’t quote me on this, but if we’re talking about a website, to design and develop a website for you, based on the little that I know about you already, it’s going to be between 20 to 30 thousand dollars, including development. It will be a WordPress site, where you will be able to manage the content itself. It will be a custom theme that we build for you. Um, in terms of the identity, we can design the logo for 10K, and to design 3 pieces of collateral, usually a business card, an email signature, some–whatever else you think you need, that’s probably an additional 10,000 dollars, but I want to warn you, usually the website is the one that has the most range because of features and functions that you want to add to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@8:06 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Okay. Well, I’m interested in moving forward. What would be the next steps?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@8:10 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Okay. So, what I can do is I can send you a deck that will outline our process so that you have something more concrete (I don’t know if this is something that you need to share with your team. I want to make sure that everyone feels good about doing this, because once we get into the discover phase, we’ll need to align all of the stakeholders.). So I’ll send you a deck and if that feels good, it will have an outline of a budget and timeline. That would be the next step. And then we can arrange a call to go over the proposal that I send you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay. Sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Is that cool?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. You’re like being too easy on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: No, I’m not. I’m learning. Because I’m taking…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You’re taking notes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@8:53 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Yeah, I’m taking notes because I want to say that we’re essentially not doing exactly the same thing, but you’re right how you took the two meetings and you’re putting them into one. When I said “case studies,” I did mean “process.” As in, I’m showing (what I’m saying is a “case study”) is it’s the strategy roadmap that I walk them through, so I’m essentially doing everything that you’re doing, minus the proposal, because at that second meeting, they say, “Yes, let’s move forward.” Then we move straight to [the] contract and invoice. So, we’re kinda doing a similar thing except you’re condensing it even shorter, except then, there is work in the backend to do. But you use a template, I know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@9:33 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: We use a template and you usually shuffle around a few projects to make sure they feel like, “Yeah. These are in alignment with what I want to do.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@9:41 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Now most of the time, it never goes that smoothly where I just say that and they’re like, “Great! Here’s all the money in the world!” There’s usually a little push-back here and there, and we didn’t get to explore that. But I just want to move the conversation tighter, so the next time it’s proposals, we’ll review it, and then after that it’s contracts. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And that’s it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah, I still don’t see the–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: There are no visuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: The big advantage of…What’s the biggest advantage of moving from what I’m doing currently to what you’re saying?&lt;br/&gt; @10:14 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Well, to be honest, if you had said that everything sounds great, I’d just send you no proposal–I mean, no work, I would just send you the budget and timeline, because you already bought in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: But that doesn’t usually happen, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@10:24 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: It never happens. I’m sorry. Let me restate: It almost never happens. It has happened to use before. Where I’m literally driving in from home to work, and I’m closing a hundred-thousand dollar job in my car because I wasn’t even thinking it was a real job: “And yes, this sounds great. We’ll start the schedule Fri–I’ll coordinate with the executive team to come out to Los Angeles to come and work with you.” And I said, “Okay, great. I’ll send you a budget.” So I went in, talked to my executive producer at that time, and I said, “Hey! We need to send an invoice for an estimate, and I want nothing else except for the price.” You describe it exactly the way I say it and you put a price because, at this point, what you don’t want to do is go past the sale. Once the client says, “I agree. A hundred thousand bucks. Let’s do it.” I don’t send anything else because they might see something that confuses them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So we would be able to skip that step. So in this roleplay, I volunteered to send you a deck that I shouldn’t have, so that was my bad. Because you didn’t even ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right. I would normally ask for it. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, you would normally ask for it. Yeah. I was prepared for you to ask for it, so, it was kinda in the typical scenario to…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: My brain was full, so I was…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s okay. So that’s why I’m like, “Yeah, boom. There it is.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right. So I’m doing the…essentially when you’re showing them something visually, and you’re saying it to them, and possibly having a follow-up call, I’m condensing that into a meeting whereby the end of it they’re saying, “Yes. Let’s go.” And then I skip the sending of the proposal and go straight to the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. We might be nerding out a little bit too much here for people to understand exactly what the heck we’re doing. The point is, you should be–honestly, I could stand in a room with you, all day long, with no visuals, and still close the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: But you’re still having to send the proposal, with the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@12:05 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Well, if necessary, I would send no proposal. If you want me to roleplay that, I could do that, but I’m just saying: All these things are, uh, in a way, crutches. Really, your mind is what they’re paying for, so you should be able to describe what you do and how you do it. Without any visual, without any deck. The deck is just to back-up what you said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I will be working on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, well, you already have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah. It’s just reshuffling what, how I approach it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@12:37 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Yeah. And I think, if anything, what you wanna do is describe the process in simpler, like more bite-sized pieces because the brain can only hold so much, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And so, only give them more information as they need it. So like, try to like, look at it like this is a block of marble, and then we make some kind of broad chips away at it, and then it kinda looks like a human, and they’re like, “Yeah, yeah. That’s what we really want. But what does the head look like?” And then you chisel away so that it starts to look like it’s a man and not a woman, or it’s a soldier, or a general, it’s old or young, whatever. So I only dive into it as I feel like it’s needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So the ability to expand and contract is very dynamic, so if you want more information, then I will expand it. If you don’t, [then] I close it. And it’s just being able to move and manage energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Got it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, now, what else do we need to talk about?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: The quoting of “I’m so focused on strategy,” which is good because it set me on the right track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Now the pricing of the deliverables, or everything that comes after that, I’m stumbling because I don’t, I didn’t even think about that part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. That’s okay. So you’ve seen as a member of the pro-group, you’ve seen our price sheet. It’s in there somewhere. Have you seen that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I have to look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, it’s in there. Yeah, it’s in there. We put together an old price sheet of like, the deliverables and some of them have really big ranges like the website. Some of them are much more contained because we know what it’s going to take for us to produce a logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@14:10&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Now I’m getting all this work and a lot of leads, and now it is developing a structure to my business and systems and the process and like a very solid framework so that I can even see how much I can take on and when I need to hire people and when there’s a bottleneck, I’m in that growing pains place where I have a lot of work, but I need to know how, how can I not grow so fast that I can’t support all that work and hit the timelines and take on multiple things?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Do you feel stressed out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I don’t feel stressed out. I feel, I feel like I’m being stretched. That hurts sometimes, but I wouldn’t say it’s stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Are you working into the wee hours of the night?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@14:53 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Okay, time to get help. I told you before: Do not hire anybody, but I think it’s time to hire somebody. Now, I don’t mean to hire somebody like full-time and all that kind of stuff. I think you need a roster of a couple of people that you can call that are semi-available, and you just move through those people, and they understand your process and how do what you do. Ideally right now, in the next phase of your growth for 2018, what I want you to do is to focus on doing strategy, continue to refine it, on-board clients at a higher rate, so just start to move that rate higher and higher, so now that you’ve been able to close a few of these strategic engagements at 5 thousand bucks, I would say it’s the time to move to 10. I want you to move to 10, and you’ll get a little pushback, and then you’ll just get to 10, okay? And then as you settle into 10, the next thing will be from 10 to 20. You just keep doing that, keep doubling it. When you are able to charge that much for strategy, then you can afford to hire lots of different kinds of people and you know that the deliverables are kind of relative to this strategic part. Meaning that a client that’s going to nickel and dime you at 2 thousand dollars for design work is never going to agree to pay you 5 for discovery alone. Because they don’t value thinking. So this is a great filter. This is a great qualifier. If they’re not on–if they’re not gonna come on board to do strategy with you, it means that they don’t value that kind of thinking. And a lot of you that are watching this right now, are going to say, “Yeah, I do brand strategy,” just like Melinda used to say to me. But when you really know how to do it (and I told you during that show: “One day you’ll see and you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about.” That day has come obviously and you see, and it’s a game changer), it changes the entire way that you think and how you work, and it almost is like you can’t do that dumb thing anymore. You can’t just move images around. You can’t just make shapes anymore. Because it seems frivolous at this point. So you’ve crossed over this threshold that you can’t go back on, which is wonderful and I’m glad to see you do this, right? So this is what (if you guys are watching), you do need to learn actually how to do this. You can’t just say the words. And the words that you use might actually be very different from the experience that she’s having. So why don’t we take a minute here to try to explain to people a little bit more finely “strategy before” and “strategy after,” according to Melinda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Oh, yeah. It’s a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Can you do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@17:21&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah. “Strategy before” was me gathering all of the questions, um, in a questionnaire, that I needed…that I personally needed to design a logo, so that was asking a lot of similar questions to what I do now, but in a completely different way. One, it was homework for my client, so it was not a face-to-face meeting, there was no trust being built during that time. I’ve definitely realized that being face-to-face with my client in the workshop meetings changes everything. They actually trust you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And who told you that wise piece of advice? [Laughter.] Yes, I did. I did. You set yourself up, but, okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It’s true, it’s true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@18:03&lt;br/&gt; [C]: And why does–what’s the difference when you’re doing face-to-face. A lot of people will think: “If it’s the same question, what is the value of face-to-face?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It’s soooo different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Tell us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@18:15&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: In the questionnaire, it was “the question.” And I might follow-up with their answer, depending on what their answer was if I didn’t understand…um, in the workshop, I can dig deeper into things (I’m trying to find golden nuggets). I’m trying to find golden nuggets that are, um, unique to them, unique to their ideal client, and then start making connections and so that my questionnaire before reached like, surface-level, like enough to get an “okay” logo out of it, and now we’re digging so deep that…to the things that will actually make the difference and truly connecting to the ideal client, whereas the other, it was just enough to get a good logo out of it. But it didn’t mean that it was connecting with our ideal client, so I’m able to ask deep questions, I’m able to make connections, and then I’m also able to help facilitate my own clients’ thinking, so then I see them light up because they say, “Oh my gosh! I just realized something about my business!” Or, “I just realized that I need to change my services!” One client actually changed her services, and she pivoted her whole business based off of our conversation during strategy–which that would not happen during a questionnaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@19:20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. I’m gonna show you guys an example. Melinda! We’re gonna order lunch today from Tender Greens. What would you like to eat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: What kind of salad?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: The Caesar salad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Caesar salad. Uhh, you want bread with that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. And do you want soup?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Soup. And, vegetable soup is okay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Now what was I doing? I was literally an “order-taker.” And that’s what the questionnaire does. It sets you up to be the person to receive direction from your client, and there was no dialogue. Okay. Let’s try this again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@20:01&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Melinda, are you hungry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Very.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mmm. Would you like to get something to eat?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes, I would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Do you have any kind of dietary restrictions? Are you in the mood for something?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uhh, anything that has cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You love cheese?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I love cheese, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Any kind of specific cheese?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@20:24&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Umm, mozzarella.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mozzarella. Any other things I need to know about any dietary preferences? Are you like, allergic to gluten? Are you like on a fish diet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I don’t really like fish too much, so I like to avoid that,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, no fish. So you like mozzarella cheese.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Anything else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Umm…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Are you trying to achieve any kind of fitness or health goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Just satisfy my hunger at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So, what is important to you then is that it gives good portions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I want really good food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Good food?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I want really good food. Like I wanna leave there just so happy that I ate at that restaurant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:01&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Oh. Have you ever had an experience like this somewhere else?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I have, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Where?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M] “Club 33,” Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: “Club 33?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I remember leaving there just so happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: What did you order?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I ordered a filet mignon. I ordered probably something with cheese. I ordered (Gosh, there was like seven courses. I don’t remember.). I just remember leaving happy. That’s what I want. I want to leave happy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:30&lt;br/&gt; [C]: I’m curious. Was being inside Disneyland a part of the experience, or was it just–were we just talking about the food?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:31&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Uh, it was part of the experience, but the food was just overarching. But yes, it made the experience really good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:39&lt;br/&gt; [C]: And, can we try to break it up between how much of it was being in Disneyland and how much of it was the food, like on a scale of like 1 to 10, how much of that 10 would you give out to the experience versus the quality of the food?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:57&lt;br/&gt; [M]: I think it was 40% experience, 60% food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@21:58&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Oh, okay. This is very important. Because initially I thought maybe I can just send somebody out to pick it up and bring it here, but then you would be only getting 60, and 60% in my book is like a “D.” For grading, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah, sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: 60% is a “D.” It’s like one letter away from an “F.” Why don’t we just do this? Let’s go there. Let me call an Über, let’s get you some tickets, and let’s get inside Disneyland, and let’s just have that meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@22:21 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: I would love that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Let’s do it! Okay, and so that–I wanna stop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Now I’m hungry!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It does nothing for me because I have no idea what “Club 33” is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It’s so good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@22:34&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay! So in one way, I’m just listening and just writing down what she wants. In another way, I’m really trying to surface what she really wants. And I’m trying to understand something. Now, I want Melinda to do this without any bias, like, trying to help me achieve a certain goal or not. In the first instance, maybe you felt like, attended to. You felt important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Because I was like, “I’m gonna take your order!” And you were like, “Yeah! Cool! But, tell me how you felt about the second approach and what that was doing to you on a psychological, emotional level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@23:04&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I was literally imagining myself sitting there and eating the food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: And so I was feeling already the feelings I would have when I’m sitting there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: That’s part of it–that’s a big part of it actually. I didn’t feel anything. I felt important when you asked me those questions as far as the order taking, but, I was…I was enjoying the thought of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@23:28&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Here’s the difference, really: First, I could’ve just gotten you something with mozzarella and you would be fine. And you just wanted to be full, so I could’ve gotten you lots of different meals, but then I got us to the perfect meal. The one that matters the most to you. And it takes time to figure that out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@23:45&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And, I could have also made a lot of assumptions when you said “Club 33.” I could have stopped there and just went out and got it. And not even help you to realize that it’s actually–40% of the experience is just being there, where you smelled the cotton candy or the vanilla, and it’s Mainstream USA and it kinda helps you to relive a childhood experience, so there’s a lot of connection to memory and celebration and ceremony that we won’t get just by giving you the plate of food.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@24:14&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So, in the world of design, [let’s] bring it back to design for a second. There’s lots of logos that I could’ve given her, ones that she could’ve ordered and she could’ve said, “I want modern, sophisticated!” and that’s what the questionnaire would do for you. But once I enter into dialogue, I found that there is a preference when, when she can choose anything, she chooses to have mozzarella and I could’ve gotten that from lots of different places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@24:35&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And then when we got a little bit close, she’s describing this certain kind of design, or something that she wants and not even realizing it, that there’s more to that than just that thing that we’re gonna make. So I’m able to surface something much deeper inside of her that gets really close to what she wants. And generally speaking, when you do that with people, they get the feels. Like, “Wow! Somebody has taken the time to kinda understand me. To really take the time to understand me.” And it takes more time. And that’s why people give you a hug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@25:11&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s why people change their whole business models, because you helped them to realize something.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And that is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Now, I will send you a bill for 10,000 dollars [laughter] to help you realize what that meal means to you. Is that cool? That’s the most expensive filet mignon you’ve ever had in your life. You’re like: “I’m not paying you for that.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@25:32&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Now, unfortunately–or, fortunately, actually, think about this: When Melinda speaks to her next prospective vendor, she’s going to be comparing the feelings that she got versus how they made her feel. THis is why, when you do this correctly, you should have almost no competition. Because she’s going to walk away like, “Oh, yeah. I have to call these 2 more vendors to make sure. And vendor number one won’t give her a questionnaire. It’s like, “Okay, we can do it. Here’s the price.” And then, vendor number 2 might ask some questions via a questionnaire, but they’re not going to go as deep as we just did. And I think that’s one of the key things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@26:16&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Right. I would also add…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: That there are some clients who desire the questionnaire, and desire to dictate everything, and I know that there is a way to pivot (I have learned that)…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uh-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: But, it’s not as easy as someone that does wanna be–like, that is more open to be understood. Obviously, there’s–it’s an easier entry point, but there are some clients that wanna go in and just dictate–like, the ones that just want the deliverable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@26:46&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Like the logo, and they won’t budge from that, and those are the ones that want the questionnaire, and they want the old Melinda, and they’re not gonna get the old Melinda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: They can’t have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: They can’t have it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: She’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: She’s gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You make me proud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Thank you for watching and listening to me talk about food and cheese and, uh, Chris getting mad at me for giving one line in my…my uh (What is it?) “role play.” Which I hate. Hate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright you guys. Hopefully, hopefully you enjoyed this episode. Smash that “like” button and subscribe, and I wanna see more of Melinda and kinda track her progress as she continues to move up in the world. And I think probably, just (this is a pretty safe prediction) her next challenges will be to hire, to manage and build her team because she will not be able to keep up with the work. And that’s all I have for you guys, see you guys next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

It turns out it was all completely internal. No one was applying this pressure except for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was entering each prospective meeting with the idea that I must sell to this person. That I have to blow them away with my presentation and convince them to pay for my services. I came in with expectations to &lt;em&gt;wow&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;win&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the problem.

This takes all the pressure off of me. This turns the presentation into a conversation, focused on the value we can create together if we were to engage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I create value by asking high-quality questions that exhibit my position as a fiduciary for their best interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I always ask these three golden questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What are your goals?”&lt;br/&gt;“What’s getting in the way?”&lt;br/&gt;“How can I help?”&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve found that having a “helpful” mindset and asking high-value questions are more powerful than any prepared slideshow deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT the end of each meeting:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;The prospect feels like I have their best interest at heart because I have put their needs ahead of my own sales agenda.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’ve proven my value as a consultant and partner because I’ve been able to target their challenges and have surfaced insights that could positively impact their life or business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They’re more willing to pay a premium since the problems I’m solving are bigger than the project they originally contacted me for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In some cases, we determine we’re not a good fit.

I’m catching up with—you guessed it—with Melinda, and she’s here. And she’s had some tremendous growth. So I wanna talk to her, and, without further ado: Melinda, what has been going on with your life? Last we spoke, last time we spoke…LAST TIME WE SPOKE! She was like, “Chris! All my work is gone! What did you do to me? Are you trying to ruin me or what?” And I said, “You know: Stay with the plan, follow the process. Trust me, and I’ll take care of you.” So, wonderful things have happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Melinda Livsey]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You are leading the charge for a bunch of designers to start to charge for their knowledge. So I wanna hear kinda where you’re at, and then I’m gonna ask you a bunch of questions about how you got to be where you’re at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Give us the like the BIG update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: The big update, well, last time I was here we were here with Rebecca and I was saying how all of my leads had dried up and my work, and I was probably eating Top Ramen and something, ugh…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh, hush! HUSH!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Wasting away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Top Ramen over Kobe steak! But yes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: But now! Yes! Yes! So since then, one huge thing that’s changed are the leads. The leads are coming in. I have a lot, a lot of leads, which now (and I’ve sold jobs at a much higher price), now I have to do them, and so I’m dealing with actually—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C] New problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah, new problems! Great problems! I’m not complaining, I’m very thankful. Um, but it’s a completely different—it’s a huge shift. A huge shift that just started…I would say right after Thanksgiving, I got all the leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: So it does take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It took a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I just want to let everybody know: It does take some time. You all expect instant results. Like, if I do X, then Y will happen immediately. And it doesn’t work like that. Real life does not work like that. It takes time to, to prepare the soil, to, to plant, and then you don’t get the harvest for some time. So let’s just get into the nitty and the gritty, if you will. The nitty-gritty, which is: You’re getting a bunch of leads now, which is fantastic (we’ll talk more about how you got those leads), but let’s talk about charging more. Let’s just dangle the carrot out there for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@2:32&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: What do you mean that you’re charging more? Like, how much more? Where do you go from and where are you at now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @2:38&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I went from 1) not doing strategy at all (using a questionnaire as my “strategy,” I would say)…I mean, I wasn’t charging for that, and now I am charging. I’m leading with that. I’m actually selling that–I’m not really selling. I’m trying to align with my client. I don’t want to say sell because I’m not pushing anyone into anything. Um, I’m aligning with their goals and their problems, and I am offering them strategy first, really as the only option if they would like to work with me. And, um, I’m presenting it in a way that they’ve fallen in love with strategy, and then I’m charging for it. So that is a massive change from not charging for a questionnaire (which I DID call my “strategy”), to actually doing in-person workshops and selling that strategy. That’s a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. I think you’ve done an excellent job of avoiding my question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Well, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: How much are you charging from–How much are you charging today relative to what you were just charging a little while ago? Can you give us an idea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Well, it’s just completely different because the structure is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well then, tell me about that structure and then the price attached to that structure then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@3:48 &lt;br/&gt;[M]:Okay. So previously, I charged zero for strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Now I charge (the last one) I’ve charged 5,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: 5,000 bucks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: So I went from zero…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: WOO!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: …to 5,000 for strategy alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C] Okay. So that’s a big number for a lot of people to process right now and some people are like: “Well, what is strategy? Like, what do you mean you charge 5,000 and why weren’t you able to do it before?” So we’ll spend a little time talking about this part. And I think the people want to know, ‘cause this is radically different because people are struggling in the streets, wherever you’re watching this, to even get four or five hundred bucks for a logo. And that’s like WORK. You’re talking about like getting paid to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s a good problem to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@4:40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. So let’s talk a little bit about that then. Um, in terms of, What is strategy to you now? We kind of understand a little bit about what you referenced before, but, now that you’re doing it, tell the people what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Tell the people what it is. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Pretend like—okay—pretend like I’m a client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Oh, man!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Like: Ding dong! Hey, Melinda! I wanna work with you. I saw your work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Oh, role play! Again?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You can’t avoid it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Chris, you know how this turns out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It turns out great every single time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah, every single time. It’s great! It, yeah…Well it’s…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: …Open to interpretation. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, so—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I’m just a brand new client. This time it’s gonna be really easy because you’re a super pro now, so, you know: Ring, ring! Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@5:18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I wanna work with you! I saw your website, I’ve seen you on all these podcasts, and your Instagram is amazing—I wanna work with you. How do we do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: You wanna work with me? What are you looking for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I’m looking to rebrand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Oh! You’re looking to rebrand. Okay. So have you thought of a certain budget? Do you have a certain budget set aside for this?&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;[C]: I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: You don’t. Well, okay. Typically, depending on the size of your company, marketing efforts are around 5% to 10%, depending on what your goal is, so, of your gross revenue, so, with that said, what’s your goal of rebranding? Why are you even…what makes you want to rebrand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I just feel like it’s outdated, and you know, I hired some friend of the family who did it originally and it’s been okay, but we’re growing and I feel like when I look at what we do, I don’t feel proud of our identity. I’m not proud at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @6:19 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: And so, could you describe to me where you’re at currently? As far as where you want to grow? I hear you wanna grow, so that’s your ideal. And you want to continue to grow, so that’s your ideal. But you feel that you are stale or…Can you describe to me what that feeling is? Why do you feel that way about your brand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Well, I’m gonna show you this: Does this look jenky to you? This feels like it’s not professional, it doesn’t feel like we’re innovative, it doesn’t feel like it’s reflective of what our value is. We’re an 80 million dollar company, and this looks like some kid did it, because in truth, some kid did do it. I want a professional touch. I saw the work that you do: It’s very classy, it’s very stylish, it’s very modern–that’s what I want for my company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @7:05&lt;br/&gt;[M]: Great! Well, it sounds like (from what I’m hearing) your ideal client…are they feeling the same thing that you are, too? Are you losing them? Are you gaining them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Hmm, I don’t know. I think we would like to have more clients…We’re growing, so, I think we’re gaining clients and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @7:25&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Well, typically during this conversation, I would have something visual to show, and I would be writing down where you are (which is here) and then I would be writing down your ideal (which is there), so that they can see it visually and we’re both looking at something together. And then I would break it down where the middle (this is your aim), so I start asking you questions: “Well, what is this…What’s an attainable goal about midway between where you are now and where you wanna be? What would that look like to you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Well, you know, I don’t know yet. I mean, I just, really would like to start with the rebrand, so I’m thinking: we need a new logo, we need a new identity system, probably somewhere down the line, we’ll need a website to reflect all this stuff, but for right now, I think the identity is really important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @8:06&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Great, so, those are the tasks that will get us to that goal, [but] what does that goal actually look like for your company? Where is your company during that time? Is it–did your company grow in revenue? Do you want your company to grow as far as sales, as far as attracting a certain kind of customer? What does that look like? Because those things (the logo, the rebrand) are more of a vehicle to get you to the goal, or a task to get you there, but they aren’t the end goal. So they’re there to get you to your goal. So what would that look like for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Maybe I’m not understanding this: I just feel like things don’t look very good right now. And I feel like, if we could just do that, I’d be more proud to represent ourselves like, as we go out into the world. I almost feel ashamed. Like, I don’t want to even give you my business card right now. Do you know what I mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @8:58&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah, yeah. So then, an attainable goal that I’m hearing is that, it would be that you’re proud of your company, and that you would want to go around and that you want to be proud of it, that you want to show it off, you wanna feel that you are above your competitors. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @9:14&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Well, this is how I do it! (And then, you would see visually, how strategy comes into play with that.) Strategy is the core that we have to start with, the next thing are objectives (so that would be something like UX, that would be marketing funnels, that would be goals (measurable goals), from there we have deliverables. And so, if we actually start with the logo first, we’re going to have a very shell of a brand, and it’s not going to be held up by anything because there’s no goals, and there’s no purpose. So we actually start with brand strategy first. And then you would see a goal, or you would see a diagram of that if you were sitting down with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Okay. This feels right. I feel like you’re the right person to do this. So, how much do you charge to do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @10:00&lt;br/&gt; [M]: So typically, brand strategy is, it starts at 5,000 and it can range all the way to 15. And you would see also what those options would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Okay, and what do I get for that? Like, why do I have to do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @10:11&lt;br/&gt; [M]: It sounds like you want to get to your goal and typically my clients, which in this conversation, we would end up seeing that you’re possibly not focused, that you’re trying to do several things at once, but not getting very far, and so I have some things to walk through to show that, and usually clients are like: Yes, I totally relate to that. So with that, focus and clarity are what I’m mainly leading with, with strategy, and so the first package is strategy to find out who the ideal client is, to know them very well, to also provide a marketing funnel strategy (so the overarching funnel of how does the client become aware of you, all the way to, how do they end up  being an advocate for your company)? Because you want people to share and re-feed the funnel so that you don’t have to keep putting money in. So does that sound good? Put money back in to gain those ideal clients if they’re your advocates?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That sounds great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @11:09&lt;br/&gt; [M]: And we would also go over your brand, too, and who you are so that what you said about wanting to be confident in your brand and be able to feel like you’re above the competition, we would also nail down all the attributes, the positioning statement, the value proposition, in that early time so that we know where we’re going and you know where you’re going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;@11:30&lt;br/&gt; [C]: That sounds all wonderful, but I just want you to do our identity. Can we just skip this process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  @11:36 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Well, do you have a brand strategy already?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I have something, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: You have something? And what does that entail?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Uh, I can send it to you after this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @11:51&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Maybe I can kinda share with you what we have. It has a little bit about our mission statement, what some of our beliefs are…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @11:53&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Okay. That more stands for something that is aligned with your business plan, and this is more aligned with how you reach your ideal client. So they’re a little bit different. And I work through this certain process, so if you’d like to work with me, then we do start at brand strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @12:12&lt;br/&gt; [C]: So you’re saying you won’t do this unless we hire you to do the brand strategy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @12:17&lt;br/&gt; [M]: That’s correct because I feel that I’ve actually used to do this, I used to be a freelancer and I used to take on the projects that were the deliverables, and I didn’t even think about what my clients’ goals were, and if we were reaching those goals, and if we were helping the client get to those goals, and it was–I ended up being an expense. And I don’t want to do that to my clients anymore, so I have switched over to the world of brand strategy because I want to align with my clients’ goals, and then have them align with their own clients. (So this is again, there is a diagram here where it shows “brand strategy,” “objectives,” and “deliverables.” So people typically come to me for the deliverables, but there is no goal or no strategy attached, so you don’t know if you’re reaching your goal. So then, it always ends up being an expense and not an investment.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @13:08&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Okay, you’ve given me a lot to think about here. So if this strategy part costs $5,000 dollars (and I hear a lot of people say this, so I’m not sure if y’all’s are saying the same thing), but if I have to spend 5,000 bucks, then okay. What’s the logo gonna cost me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @13:26&lt;br/&gt; [M]: The logo is going to cost you a minimum of 5,000 on top of the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Okay, a minimum. Okay, what would affect the price?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: The complexity…the…(I’m breaking character.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You, you can’t just decide when you want to break character!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Well, yes! I can! I can!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yo! Yo! My brain can’t process like when you’re like: Is she breaking character?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@13:47&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Well I have visuals, so we’re breaking my own process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: No, we’re just having a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I know, I don’t have this…I do visuals, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mmm. Alright.   [M]: So I go from initial…&lt;br/&gt; [C]: I gotta coach you on how to do this without anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Well I, I have to do it with visuals currently because I have nothing on my site to show this, at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Well, it doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay, well then…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You have it up here (*points to his head*)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Do teach, Master Do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I will. I will, but let’s just finish this out though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;@14:08&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Okay. So I’m just saying this because my process that I’m currently doing, this would not happen. Because I have case studies to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: And I have a process to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: So.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Ah. Interesting. Okay. So, where were we? I was asking about like—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And it’s like, “What can impact the price?” And you answered that, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. Now you see, now we’re like busy arguing about something, now I can’t remember anymore! It’s like an old married couple over here! It’s like, “What are we talking about?” Okay. Alright. I think we got your role playing. I think I have some tips for you, but we’ll circle back to that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;@14:48&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Okay. So we’ve established now that you charge 5,000 dollars to do strategy, and it really can impact the client’s business, which makes you feel good. It gets you a seat at the table so you’re not an “order taker,” you’re an advisor to the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And I like that you stood your ground, so if they insist that this is not going to happen, what–how do you say it? So let me get back into the role play. Don’t break character now! Stop pointing to the screen like, “At this point—“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Well, I have to—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: No! No!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M] Because you’re breaking my process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So what? &lt;br/&gt;[M]: I’m just! Well, if you want to—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Improvise! Improvise!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: But if you want a true example of what goes on, then…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: If you don’t…If you want something new, that’s okay. But if you really want to know what’s going on, then, this is not what’s going on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s too much! It’s too much!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay. Go back to strategy then!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: No! We’re moving on. I don’t even know what we’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: We’re talking about if I don’t—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: We’re going to have to do some editing here!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: If I don’t take them on, then—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It’s deliverable only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@15:45&lt;br/&gt; [C]: So, so, get, get rid of me then. Let’s just say like: “Look, I really like you. I think I can spend 5 to 8 thousand dollars on the logo by itself, I’m just not really into this other thing. I just, I need to get this thing done, and we’ve had somebody do this before and it really got us nowhere. So, are you saying that you won’t take on this job?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uh, see it—I would…delve into the why…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Things went bad over there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Stay in character!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay. I thought you were leading me somewhere else. This is bad. See? This is…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: This is why Melinda never comes on the show! So that’s why she won’t come on the show anymore. Alright.  &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Ooooookay. Well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: That is—[Laughter.] Because I don’t feel that it would get you to your goal, that I’ll have to refer you to someone else that would take on a logo only, from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Hmm, okay, that’s a bummer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I would love to work with you, though. I would, truly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I would love to get those referrals. Who are you gonna send me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @16:49&lt;br/&gt; [M]: I have a list. I’ll send you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Are you checking it twice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I’ll send you right after this call. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. End scene! We’ll, we’ll stop it right there. Okay, so let’s get back to this whole thing. Uh, I’m gonna have to teach you how to say no. I’m gonna have to teach you how to do this without visuals, and so that you can be in the flow. A lot of this (okay, you’re relatively new still, relatively speaking), so soon you’ll be able to do this kinda over the phone while you’re driving to have Starbucks. It’ll be no problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: And the initial call, which I took from you last time, was to qualify the price. So the initial one is that and then the second one is (just letting you know what I’m current doing) to get them on a Skype call or an in-person meeting if I am local. And that’s why I use visuals because I have nothing on my site. Because I lead with deliverables at the moment on my website, which is not going to be that way next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Good. You already know the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I already know. So that’s why I felt like instead of having things on my website and case studies that I’m gonna have them in-person and show them and talk them through it that…which so far has worked out for me to get to five thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @18:05 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Alright, so! I’m gonna say this because I’m gonna give voice to our audience that are watching: They’re like, “Oh, my God! I can’t believe she’s saying no to a five to eight thousand dollar logo!” How are you gonna handle that criticism? Like, what did you charge to do this, like, a year ago?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: A year ago? I was charging…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Before we met. &lt;br/&gt;[M]: The top one, which was a branding package, was $6300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @18:28&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Okay, so a year ago, you were happy with $6300. And now, just a year later, if somebody’s gonna offer you five to eight thousand dollars to do a logo again, and you’re like, “Hm.” How do you speak to that? Like, what has happened to you? So spoiled so fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Well, those people that are complaining, now they have a client! Potentially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That you’re gonna give them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: That I will give them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: And why would you do that now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @18:53&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Why would I do that now? Because of the reasons that I was telling you, that, as the client, one, I know that it’s not necessarily (I don’t know this for sure, but) it’s not necessarily gonna reach their goal, and so, if everything’s not in alignment as far as strategy and their goals and we’re not getting anywhere, we’re just checking things off a list, so it’s like: “Do you wanna have–do you just wanna check something off a list or do you want to be effective?” And I (now that I’ve tasted the greatness, I wanna be effective! Because to me, that’s worth more than money. It really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I see. So it’s almost like you took the pill and you entered into the matrix, and now you know it’s all fake. That’s not cheeseburger that you’re eating, it’s like code, and you can’t go back. You’d rather live in the raw, dirty world that we know, rather than go back to that place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That’s interesting. Okay, so, there’s a lot of people in our group (in our pro-coaching group) who are still… (I don’t wanna use the word “struggling,” but it’s still a challenge for them to get to that place where they can charge five thousand dollars just for the thinking part. There’s only a handful. There’s about half a dozen of you guys so far that have separated out (and I know that there are a lot of people that think that, “Mmm, I charge strategy for all of that, but it’s all lumped together). So first of all, I want to say kudos to you for being able to do it, and also, kind of listening to the advice that I give you, and, a lot of people are like: “I’m doing it.” But they don’t do it the way that I tell them to do it, so then I’m like, “You’re not doing it.” Right? So some people still kind of mush it together and I don’t think they’re confident enough to separate it apart. Because once you separate it, you’re validating that there’s value there, and that they’re willing to hire you for that reason, and that’s excellent. So I have to ask you this question: What makes you so special? What makes you so different? Because I give advice out to strangers on the Internet, I give advice to the coaching group, one-on-one coaching…Why, why were you able to achieve what they weren’t able to achieve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @20:59 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: That’s a deep question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That’s what I’m here for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I feel like it’s a simple answer though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: What is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I just did it. I just started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That’s helpful. [Laugher.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @21:10 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Well, it is to those who are stalled. Just do the first small, very small step. Whatever that is. For me, it was: Learn how to do strategy. The second one, it was: Get someone to agree to let me do strategy for them for their company. One of them was my cousin! One of them was my good friend/client that I have worked with before. Uhh, another one was a previous client. Um, someone else was a friend, and, yeah, I think one other was a previous client as well, so, a lot of them were friends, they were family members, they were previous clients, that I felt comfortable with, and they agreed to, to let me do strategy for them. And with every single one of those, I got more confident with it. And then I realized, “Oh my gosh! There’s magic in this!” Like I, I was converted after that!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: The skies parted and this ray of light came and you’re like, “Oh, it’s so warm in the sunlight!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @22:08 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: But it really came–It came after every single strategy that I did for someone, I saw the difference that it made or the lightbulb that came on with them and the clarity that they had, and then I thought, “Oh my gosh! If this happened with the first person, just think about what will happen with the next, and the next! And, every time I did it, yeah! I got better, I changed my strategy document and my process as I went ‘cause I was seeing the needs, or I saw the roadblocks, or what was not necessary. Or where things got confusing and I straightened those out and, every time…Every time I do strategy now, I add something or I take something away because of what I’ve done previously, and now I’m…I feel confident in what I’m charging and I feel confident in even raising my prices because I see the impact that it’s making on the businesses that I’ve already worked with–and the people! It’s not just the business, it’s the (like, I had one client–and she’s the one that was my friend, she said, “You’re the only one that I feel got, who understands my vision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Mmm. Did she give you a hug?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Pretty much, yeah. She did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Did she cry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Uh, I don’t know about crying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Alright. I’m gonna get you to “Do” status where they start crying and huggin’ you. Like, “Oh my God! You’re so good!” Alright, this is good. ‘Cause it can be cathartic. I just wanna say that. “Cathartic.” And we’ll put the definition right there: “cathartic.” Okay, so, you did a great job of explaining something, but you didn’t answer my question. I wanna get into your mind. I wanna crawl into this brain and say like, there’s some random dude that you saw on the Internet. And you come in, and you chat with me a couple of times, a little bit of coaching and I told you that you’re not doing strategy. And, you took it like a champ. You got like an iron chin because I smacked you and you were like, “Yeah, what else you got?” I’m like, “Oh, I got more.” And then, you get into the core framework, and you quietly go off and do your thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @24:03&lt;br/&gt; [C]: It is a special somebody that can just take a little bit of information and even though it’s counter to everything that they’ve done before that moment, yet you’re willing to just move forward without sitting there and thinking, over-analyzing, over-thinking, and die a death of paralysis by analysis. You just did it! And, what, what, what’s in your personality, what’s in your background and your upbringing, your belief system that allows you just do it. Because that’s the magic. If I can figure it out with you, I can make a lot of difference to those people out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @24:42&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Right. Okay. That’s deep. Hold on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I’m gonna move you center to the camera and I’m gonna move out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Are you gonna have music? Can you have music and…?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Just tell the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: The people. Okay. First, it’s my beliefs. Because I feel that my accomplishments don’t define who I am. That who I am is, is not attached to what I do, or what I accomplish, or even the things that I fail with or fail doing. Um, that’s a first one that, that who I am matters to the one that matters most to me. Um, and so, that, to me, that’s my guiding light in life, and so that’s how I approach most situations and I’m growing (obviously I’m not perfect, but that’s…that’s my beliefs). ‘Cause I feel like we talked about thoughts influence behaviors, but even before that I believe it’s beliefs. Um, belief about who you are and why you’re here. Um, that’s the first one, it’s like the deepest! The deepest one! Uh, the second one is, I believe it is in my personality to just do things. Um, when I was sixteen, my cousin/piano teacher, he wanted me to start teaching piano and I was like, “I’m sixteen years old. I don’t even know piano that well. I’m not that great.” And, um, a lady called me two days later and she’s like, “Hey! I heard that you give piano lessons and there’s two–I have two kids I want you to teach.” And I was like, “Well, I do now.” So, I took that, that way of just accepting things as they come, like the crazy (you know) man on the Internet that I was standing next to, um, that when opportunities come to you, when things that you learn come up, that you just embrace them. Kind of like what Chris always tells us: Embrace and pivot. But you can do that in your own life. And I, I do that in my own life. I embrace what comes and then I move forward. So, if you want it at the deepest level, that’s what…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @26:42&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Aren’t you scared?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Of what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I don’t know. Most people are afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I feel like this is weird ‘cause there’s just a voice coming in from the side! So you don’t wanna come back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: It’s okay! Just look right there. Just pour your heart out and, right into that camera. Look right down the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Say that question again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Aren’t you afraid? Like, why can you do what few people have been able to do? Besides saying, “Yeah! I just did it!” Help ‘em out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @27:08&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Umm, there is fear there, but to me, for me, the excitement is…it overshadows the fear. And the other thing that I had mentioned to Chris before when he had asked me that, um, a big difference, too, for me this past year was, was being aware of what I’m thankful for, and that, um, what that looks like for me is sending two of my friends a gratitude list of three things I’m most thankful for every single day. Every single morning, no matter how bad our day was, no matter how bad we’re feeling, that we always send three things we’re grateful for. So one, it helps with accountability because you see that your friends are doing it, and we never bash each other if we forget, but it’s the fact that we see someone else doing it and then we do it as well. Um, the other thing is just sharing in gratitude and it changes your mind that you start actually looking for those things that you’re grateful for and that are good things instead of, um, I think are–it’s easy to get into that rut of naturally seeing what we suck at, and what went bad, and how someone treated us, and start blaming things, or people for what our life is right now, so doing the gratitude list has–I feel like it’s changed my brain, too, over the past few months since…I believe I started that like a couple weeks after I got coached by Chris. And that, coupled with just moving forward and doing it, and so when I, when I did the first strategy session with my client, I had to do my gratitude list the next day and so instead of thinking, “Oh, that went horribly, I did this wrong, and I should have done this, that I was just thinking of all the good things that came out of it. And I thought: “Oh my gosh! My client was excited.” And, they found out this about their business. And they did this and I was able to uncover this or make this connection, and so, I’m constantly now thinking in the positive light instead of the negative. So that’s a big one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @29:03&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That’s fantastic! That’s fantastic. So, you, you…how long ago did you graduate from school?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]:Ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Ten years. Okay. So that means a couple of things. That means you can be pretty set in your rhythms in life for ten years and have a change like that [*snaps his fingers*]. Yet the only thing that’s stopping you is you. And that’s why I’m just so appreciative of being able to watch you grow, to see you take on things and just…you know, I’mma give myself some credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Go for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I’m just gonna go and do one of these things [*pats himself on the back*]. I’mma, I’mma say something here, is: People always ask me: How do you determine who’s gonna be on the show? ‘Cause obviously there’s a lot of people who reach out and say, “Chris! Help us! Help us! Critique this! Help me! Coach me! Mentor me!” But you see, I, I pride myself on being able to spot talent. And talent isn’t necessarily what you guys think. Some of you guys might think, “Talent? Well, she has a giant Instagram following,” or “She’s already a design superstar.” And that’s not the case at all. What I saw in Melinda, which is very rare, is, I put out a task for people to do. The task was to draw grids over logos. And, what Melinda just exceeded my expectations in such a way that I was thinking: “Here’s a person who took a little bit of an idea, a kernel, and made it blow up.” So, this is a lesson to all of you guys that that kind of spirit is rewarded whether or not you have a mentor or not. So I think that that’s the kind of attitude that you have. Give you a little bit and you just take it and you run. Nose down, head down, and you just bash with the barriers, and I just love that. And I love that you just said that you’re really excited about the potential of what’s gonna happen, and you didn’t focus too much on what you had to lose. And that’s the key thing in life. Most people think about what they have to lose; few people think about what they have to gain. That’s what you did. Excellent job there. Okay. Now that you’re just killin’ it (Killin’ it!), what do we think, the end of 2018, what are you gonna do in terms of your gross billings? ‘Cause we had said before (at the end of 2017) you wish you could get this, and that freaked people out. They were like, “What’s she complaining about? That’s a ton of money!” Yes, relatively speaking, it is, relatively speaking, but we have goals. We set goals, we smash goals, we go to our stretch goals, so what is your goal for 2018 in terms of gross billings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: A hundred and eighty thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Woohoo! A hundred and eighty thousand! It was a hundred before, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: It was a hundred before, until you told me to change it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I did?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Yes, you did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Shh! We’ll edit that part out. I didn’t say it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Okay. Yes! It was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: A hundred and eighty THOUSAND. Boom! Now, I have to ask you a couple of questions. Back when you were going to–what school did you go to again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Cal State Fullerton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Cal State Fullerton, what up?! Cal State Fullerton! Did you think, in a year, you could possibly pull down a hundred and eighty thousand? Was that part of even your idea of what you could do as a graphic designer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: No. I’ve heard–well, in school, I did hear of people getting like hundred thousand rebrands, but that in my mind was for those top agency people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Like, it wasn’t…it wasn’t anything that I thought I could necessarily do, or…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Like, out of reach for mere mortals, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Alright, so you’re closing it. You have a killer attitude. You just, now you’re in the process of redesigning your website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Excellent. You’re doing everything that you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Is there anything else that we need to talk about before we kinda get into some coaching stuff?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I wanna get into the coaching stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: You do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Alright. We’re gonna get into some coaching stuff on the next episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

I’m catching up with—you guessed it—with Melinda, and she’s here. And she’s had some tremendous growth. So I wanna talk to her, and, without further ado: Melinda, what has been going on with your life? Last we spoke, last time we spoke…LAST TIME WE SPOKE! She was like, “Chris! All my work is gone! What did you do to me? Are you trying to ruin me or what?” And I said, “You know: Stay with the plan, follow the process. Trust me, and I’ll take care of you.” So, wonderful things have happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Melinda Livsey]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You are leading the charge for a bunch of designers to start to charge for their knowledge. So I wanna hear kinda where you’re at, and then I’m gonna ask you a bunch of questions about how you got to be where you’re at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Give us the like the BIG update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: The big update, well, last time I was here we were here with Rebecca and I was saying how all of my leads had dried up and my work, and I was probably eating Top Ramen and something, ugh…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh, hush! HUSH!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Wasting away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Top Ramen over Kobe steak! But yes!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: But now! Yes! Yes! So since then, one huge thing that’s changed are the leads. The leads are coming in. I have a lot, a lot of leads, which now (and I’ve sold jobs at a much higher price), now I have to do them, and so I’m dealing with actually—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C] New problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah, new problems! Great problems! I’m not complaining, I’m very thankful. Um, but it’s a completely different—it’s a huge shift. A huge shift that just started…I would say right after Thanksgiving, I got all the leads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: So it does take time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It took a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I just want to let everybody know: It does take some time. You all expect instant results. Like, if I do X, then Y will happen immediately. And it doesn’t work like that. Real life does not work like that. It takes time to, to prepare the soil, to, to plant, and then you don’t get the harvest for some time. So let’s just get into the nitty and the gritty, if you will. The nitty-gritty, which is: You’re getting a bunch of leads now, which is fantastic (we’ll talk more about how you got those leads), but let’s talk about charging more. Let’s just dangle the carrot out there for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@2:32&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: What do you mean that you’re charging more? Like, how much more? Where do you go from and where are you at now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @2:38&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I went from 1) not doing strategy at all (using a questionnaire as my “strategy,” I would say)…I mean, I wasn’t charging for that, and now I am charging. I’m leading with that. I’m actually selling that–I’m not really selling. I’m trying to align with my client. I don’t want to say sell because I’m not pushing anyone into anything. Um, I’m aligning with their goals and their problems, and I am offering them strategy first, really as the only option if they would like to work with me. And, um, I’m presenting it in a way that they’ve fallen in love with strategy, and then I’m charging for it. So that is a massive change from not charging for a questionnaire (which I DID call my “strategy”), to actually doing in-person workshops and selling that strategy. That’s a big difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. I think you’ve done an excellent job of avoiding my question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Well, repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: How much are you charging from–How much are you charging today relative to what you were just charging a little while ago? Can you give us an idea?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Well, it’s just completely different because the structure is different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well then, tell me about that structure and then the price attached to that structure then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@3:48 &lt;br/&gt;[M]:Okay. So previously, I charged zero for strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Now I charge (the last one) I’ve charged 5,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: 5,000 bucks?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: So I went from zero…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: WOO!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: …to 5,000 for strategy alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C] Okay. So that’s a big number for a lot of people to process right now and some people are like: “Well, what is strategy? Like, what do you mean you charge 5,000 and why weren’t you able to do it before?” So we’ll spend a little time talking about this part. And I think the people want to know, ‘cause this is radically different because people are struggling in the streets, wherever you’re watching this, to even get four or five hundred bucks for a logo. And that’s like WORK. You’re talking about like getting paid to think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s a good problem to have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@4:40&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. So let’s talk a little bit about that then. Um, in terms of, What is strategy to you now? We kind of understand a little bit about what you referenced before, but, now that you’re doing it, tell the people what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Tell the people what it is. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Pretend like—okay—pretend like I’m a client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Oh, man!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Like: Ding dong! Hey, Melinda! I wanna work with you. I saw your work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Oh, role play! Again?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Laughter.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You can’t avoid it!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Chris, you know how this turns out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It turns out great every single time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah, every single time. It’s great! It, yeah…Well it’s…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: …Open to interpretation. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, so—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I’m just a brand new client. This time it’s gonna be really easy because you’re a super pro now, so, you know: Ring, ring! Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@5:18&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I wanna work with you! I saw your website, I’ve seen you on all these podcasts, and your Instagram is amazing—I wanna work with you. How do we do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: You wanna work with me? What are you looking for?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I’m looking to rebrand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Oh! You’re looking to rebrand. Okay. So have you thought of a certain budget? Do you have a certain budget set aside for this?&lt;br/&gt;  &lt;br/&gt;[C]: I don’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: You don’t. Well, okay. Typically, depending on the size of your company, marketing efforts are around 5% to 10%, depending on what your goal is, so, of your gross revenue, so, with that said, what’s your goal of rebranding? Why are you even…what makes you want to rebrand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I just feel like it’s outdated, and you know, I hired some friend of the family who did it originally and it’s been okay, but we’re growing and I feel like when I look at what we do, I don’t feel proud of our identity. I’m not proud at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @6:19 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: And so, could you describe to me where you’re at currently? As far as where you want to grow? I hear you wanna grow, so that’s your ideal. And you want to continue to grow, so that’s your ideal. But you feel that you are stale or…Can you describe to me what that feeling is? Why do you feel that way about your brand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Well, I’m gonna show you this: Does this look jenky to you? This feels like it’s not professional, it doesn’t feel like we’re innovative, it doesn’t feel like it’s reflective of what our value is. We’re an 80 million dollar company, and this looks like some kid did it, because in truth, some kid did do it. I want a professional touch. I saw the work that you do: It’s very classy, it’s very stylish, it’s very modern–that’s what I want for my company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @7:05&lt;br/&gt;[M]: Great! Well, it sounds like (from what I’m hearing) your ideal client…are they feeling the same thing that you are, too? Are you losing them? Are you gaining them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Hmm, I don’t know. I think we would like to have more clients…We’re growing, so, I think we’re gaining clients and customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @7:25&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Well, typically during this conversation, I would have something visual to show, and I would be writing down where you are (which is here) and then I would be writing down your ideal (which is there), so that they can see it visually and we’re both looking at something together. And then I would break it down where the middle (this is your aim), so I start asking you questions: “Well, what is this…What’s an attainable goal about midway between where you are now and where you wanna be? What would that look like to you?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Well, you know, I don’t know yet. I mean, I just, really would like to start with the rebrand, so I’m thinking: we need a new logo, we need a new identity system, probably somewhere down the line, we’ll need a website to reflect all this stuff, but for right now, I think the identity is really important.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @8:06&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Great, so, those are the tasks that will get us to that goal, [but] what does that goal actually look like for your company? Where is your company during that time? Is it–did your company grow in revenue? Do you want your company to grow as far as sales, as far as attracting a certain kind of customer? What does that look like? Because those things (the logo, the rebrand) are more of a vehicle to get you to the goal, or a task to get you there, but they aren’t the end goal. So they’re there to get you to your goal. So what would that look like for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Maybe I’m not understanding this: I just feel like things don’t look very good right now. And I feel like, if we could just do that, I’d be more proud to represent ourselves like, as we go out into the world. I almost feel ashamed. Like, I don’t want to even give you my business card right now. Do you know what I mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @8:58&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah, yeah. So then, an attainable goal that I’m hearing is that, it would be that you’re proud of your company, and that you would want to go around and that you want to be proud of it, that you want to show it off, you wanna feel that you are above your competitors. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Sounds good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @9:14&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Well, this is how I do it! (And then, you would see visually, how strategy comes into play with that.) Strategy is the core that we have to start with, the next thing are objectives (so that would be something like UX, that would be marketing funnels, that would be goals (measurable goals), from there we have deliverables. And so, if we actually start with the logo first, we’re going to have a very shell of a brand, and it’s not going to be held up by anything because there’s no goals, and there’s no purpose. So we actually start with brand strategy first. And then you would see a goal, or you would see a diagram of that if you were sitting down with me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Okay. This feels right. I feel like you’re the right person to do this. So, how much do you charge to do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @10:00&lt;br/&gt; [M]: So typically, brand strategy is, it starts at 5,000 and it can range all the way to 15. And you would see also what those options would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Okay, and what do I get for that? Like, why do I have to do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @10:11&lt;br/&gt; [M]: It sounds like you want to get to your goal and typically my clients, which in this conversation, we would end up seeing that you’re possibly not focused, that you’re trying to do several things at once, but not getting very far, and so I have some things to walk through to show that, and usually clients are like: Yes, I totally relate to that. So with that, focus and clarity are what I’m mainly leading with, with strategy, and so the first package is strategy to find out who the ideal client is, to know them very well, to also provide a marketing funnel strategy (so the overarching funnel of how does the client become aware of you, all the way to, how do they end up  being an advocate for your company)? Because you want people to share and re-feed the funnel so that you don’t have to keep putting money in. So does that sound good? Put money back in to gain those ideal clients if they’re your advocates?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That sounds great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @11:09&lt;br/&gt; [M]: And we would also go over your brand, too, and who you are so that what you said about wanting to be confident in your brand and be able to feel like you’re above the competition, we would also nail down all the attributes, the positioning statement, the value proposition, in that early time so that we know where we’re going and you know where you’re going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;@11:30&lt;br/&gt; [C]: That sounds all wonderful, but I just want you to do our identity. Can we just skip this process?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  @11:36 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Well, do you have a brand strategy already?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I have something, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: You have something? And what does that entail?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Uh, I can send it to you after this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @11:51&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Maybe I can kinda share with you what we have. It has a little bit about our mission statement, what some of our beliefs are…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @11:53&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Okay. That more stands for something that is aligned with your business plan, and this is more aligned with how you reach your ideal client. So they’re a little bit different. And I work through this certain process, so if you’d like to work with me, then we do start at brand strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @12:12&lt;br/&gt; [C]: So you’re saying you won’t do this unless we hire you to do the brand strategy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @12:17&lt;br/&gt; [M]: That’s correct because I feel that I’ve actually used to do this, I used to be a freelancer and I used to take on the projects that were the deliverables, and I didn’t even think about what my clients’ goals were, and if we were reaching those goals, and if we were helping the client get to those goals, and it was–I ended up being an expense. And I don’t want to do that to my clients anymore, so I have switched over to the world of brand strategy because I want to align with my clients’ goals, and then have them align with their own clients. (So this is again, there is a diagram here where it shows “brand strategy,” “objectives,” and “deliverables.” So people typically come to me for the deliverables, but there is no goal or no strategy attached, so you don’t know if you’re reaching your goal. So then, it always ends up being an expense and not an investment.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @13:08&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Okay, you’ve given me a lot to think about here. So if this strategy part costs $5,000 dollars (and I hear a lot of people say this, so I’m not sure if y’all’s are saying the same thing), but if I have to spend 5,000 bucks, then okay. What’s the logo gonna cost me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @13:26&lt;br/&gt; [M]: The logo is going to cost you a minimum of 5,000 on top of the strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Okay, a minimum. Okay, what would affect the price?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: The complexity…the…(I’m breaking character.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You, you can’t just decide when you want to break character!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Well, yes! I can! I can!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yo! Yo! My brain can’t process like when you’re like: Is she breaking character?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@13:47&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Well I have visuals, so we’re breaking my own process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: No, we’re just having a conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I know, I don’t have this…I do visuals, yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mmm. Alright.   [M]: So I go from initial…&lt;br/&gt; [C]: I gotta coach you on how to do this without anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Well I, I have to do it with visuals currently because I have nothing on my site to show this, at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Well, it doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay, well then…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You have it up here (*points to his head*)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Do teach, Master Do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I will. I will, but let’s just finish this out though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;@14:08&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Okay. So I’m just saying this because my process that I’m currently doing, this would not happen. Because I have case studies to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: And I have a process to show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: So.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Ah. Interesting. Okay. So, where were we? I was asking about like—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And it’s like, “What can impact the price?” And you answered that, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. Now you see, now we’re like busy arguing about something, now I can’t remember anymore! It’s like an old married couple over here! It’s like, “What are we talking about?” Okay. Alright. I think we got your role playing. I think I have some tips for you, but we’ll circle back to that later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;@14:48&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Okay. So we’ve established now that you charge 5,000 dollars to do strategy, and it really can impact the client’s business, which makes you feel good. It gets you a seat at the table so you’re not an “order taker,” you’re an advisor to the client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And I like that you stood your ground, so if they insist that this is not going to happen, what–how do you say it? So let me get back into the role play. Don’t break character now! Stop pointing to the screen like, “At this point—“&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Well, I have to—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: No! No!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M] Because you’re breaking my process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So what? &lt;br/&gt;[M]: I’m just! Well, if you want to—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Improvise! Improvise!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: But if you want a true example of what goes on, then…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: If you don’t…If you want something new, that’s okay. But if you really want to know what’s going on, then, this is not what’s going on!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s too much! It’s too much!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay. Go back to strategy then!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: No! We’re moving on. I don’t even know what we’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: We’re talking about if I don’t—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: We’re going to have to do some editing here!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: If I don’t take them on, then—&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: It’s deliverable only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@15:45&lt;br/&gt; [C]: So, so, get, get rid of me then. Let’s just say like: “Look, I really like you. I think I can spend 5 to 8 thousand dollars on the logo by itself, I’m just not really into this other thing. I just, I need to get this thing done, and we’ve had somebody do this before and it really got us nowhere. So, are you saying that you won’t take on this job?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Uh, see it—I would…delve into the why…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Things went bad over there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Stay in character!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: Okay. I thought you were leading me somewhere else. This is bad. See? This is…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: This is why Melinda never comes on the show! So that’s why she won’t come on the show anymore. Alright.  &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Ooooookay. Well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: That is—[Laughter.] Because I don’t feel that it would get you to your goal, that I’ll have to refer you to someone else that would take on a logo only, from the start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Hmm, okay, that’s a bummer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I would love to work with you, though. I would, truly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I would love to get those referrals. Who are you gonna send me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @16:49&lt;br/&gt; [M]: I have a list. I’ll send you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Are you checking it twice?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[M]: I’ll send you right after this call. Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. End scene! We’ll, we’ll stop it right there. Okay, so let’s get back to this whole thing. Uh, I’m gonna have to teach you how to say no. I’m gonna have to teach you how to do this without visuals, and so that you can be in the flow. A lot of this (okay, you’re relatively new still, relatively speaking), so soon you’ll be able to do this kinda over the phone while you’re driving to have Starbucks. It’ll be no problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: And the initial call, which I took from you last time, was to qualify the price. So the initial one is that and then the second one is (just letting you know what I’m current doing) to get them on a Skype call or an in-person meeting if I am local. And that’s why I use visuals because I have nothing on my site. Because I lead with deliverables at the moment on my website, which is not going to be that way next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Good. You already know the task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I already know. So that’s why I felt like instead of having things on my website and case studies that I’m gonna have them in-person and show them and talk them through it that…which so far has worked out for me to get to five thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @18:05 &lt;br/&gt;[C]: Alright, so! I’m gonna say this because I’m gonna give voice to our audience that are watching: They’re like, “Oh, my God! I can’t believe she’s saying no to a five to eight thousand dollar logo!” How are you gonna handle that criticism? Like, what did you charge to do this, like, a year ago?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: A year ago? I was charging…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Before we met. &lt;br/&gt;[M]: The top one, which was a branding package, was $6300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @18:28&lt;br/&gt; [C]: Okay, so a year ago, you were happy with $6300. And now, just a year later, if somebody’s gonna offer you five to eight thousand dollars to do a logo again, and you’re like, “Hm.” How do you speak to that? Like, what has happened to you? So spoiled so fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Well, those people that are complaining, now they have a client! Potentially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That you’re gonna give them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: That I will give them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: And why would you do that now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @18:53&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Why would I do that now? Because of the reasons that I was telling you, that, as the client, one, I know that it’s not necessarily (I don’t know this for sure, but) it’s not necessarily gonna reach their goal, and so, if everything’s not in alignment as far as strategy and their goals and we’re not getting anywhere, we’re just checking things off a list, so it’s like: “Do you wanna have–do you just wanna check something off a list or do you want to be effective?” And I (now that I’ve tasted the greatness, I wanna be effective! Because to me, that’s worth more than money. It really is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I see. So it’s almost like you took the pill and you entered into the matrix, and now you know it’s all fake. That’s not cheeseburger that you’re eating, it’s like code, and you can’t go back. You’d rather live in the raw, dirty world that we know, rather than go back to that place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That’s interesting. Okay, so, there’s a lot of people in our group (in our pro-coaching group) who are still… (I don’t wanna use the word “struggling,” but it’s still a challenge for them to get to that place where they can charge five thousand dollars just for the thinking part. There’s only a handful. There’s about half a dozen of you guys so far that have separated out (and I know that there are a lot of people that think that, “Mmm, I charge strategy for all of that, but it’s all lumped together). So first of all, I want to say kudos to you for being able to do it, and also, kind of listening to the advice that I give you, and, a lot of people are like: “I’m doing it.” But they don’t do it the way that I tell them to do it, so then I’m like, “You’re not doing it.” Right? So some people still kind of mush it together and I don’t think they’re confident enough to separate it apart. Because once you separate it, you’re validating that there’s value there, and that they’re willing to hire you for that reason, and that’s excellent. So I have to ask you this question: What makes you so special? What makes you so different? Because I give advice out to strangers on the Internet, I give advice to the coaching group, one-on-one coaching…Why, why were you able to achieve what they weren’t able to achieve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @20:59 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: That’s a deep question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That’s what I’m here for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I feel like it’s a simple answer though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: What is it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I just did it. I just started. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That’s helpful. [Laugher.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @21:10 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: Well, it is to those who are stalled. Just do the first small, very small step. Whatever that is. For me, it was: Learn how to do strategy. The second one, it was: Get someone to agree to let me do strategy for them for their company. One of them was my cousin! One of them was my good friend/client that I have worked with before. Uhh, another one was a previous client. Um, someone else was a friend, and, yeah, I think one other was a previous client as well, so, a lot of them were friends, they were family members, they were previous clients, that I felt comfortable with, and they agreed to, to let me do strategy for them. And with every single one of those, I got more confident with it. And then I realized, “Oh my gosh! There’s magic in this!” Like I, I was converted after that!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: The skies parted and this ray of light came and you’re like, “Oh, it’s so warm in the sunlight!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @22:08 &lt;br/&gt;[M]: But it really came–It came after every single strategy that I did for someone, I saw the difference that it made or the lightbulb that came on with them and the clarity that they had, and then I thought, “Oh my gosh! If this happened with the first person, just think about what will happen with the next, and the next! And, every time I did it, yeah! I got better, I changed my strategy document and my process as I went ‘cause I was seeing the needs, or I saw the roadblocks, or what was not necessary. Or where things got confusing and I straightened those out and, every time…Every time I do strategy now, I add something or I take something away because of what I’ve done previously, and now I’m…I feel confident in what I’m charging and I feel confident in even raising my prices because I see the impact that it’s making on the businesses that I’ve already worked with–and the people! It’s not just the business, it’s the (like, I had one client–and she’s the one that was my friend, she said, “You’re the only one that I feel got, who understands my vision.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Mmm. Did she give you a hug?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Pretty much, yeah. She did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Did she cry?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Uh, I don’t know about crying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Alright. I’m gonna get you to “Do” status where they start crying and huggin’ you. Like, “Oh my God! You’re so good!” Alright, this is good. ‘Cause it can be cathartic. I just wanna say that. “Cathartic.” And we’ll put the definition right there: “cathartic.” Okay, so, you did a great job of explaining something, but you didn’t answer my question. I wanna get into your mind. I wanna crawl into this brain and say like, there’s some random dude that you saw on the Internet. And you come in, and you chat with me a couple of times, a little bit of coaching and I told you that you’re not doing strategy. And, you took it like a champ. You got like an iron chin because I smacked you and you were like, “Yeah, what else you got?” I’m like, “Oh, I got more.” And then, you get into the core framework, and you quietly go off and do your thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @24:03&lt;br/&gt; [C]: It is a special somebody that can just take a little bit of information and even though it’s counter to everything that they’ve done before that moment, yet you’re willing to just move forward without sitting there and thinking, over-analyzing, over-thinking, and die a death of paralysis by analysis. You just did it! And, what, what, what’s in your personality, what’s in your background and your upbringing, your belief system that allows you just do it. Because that’s the magic. If I can figure it out with you, I can make a lot of difference to those people out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @24:42&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Right. Okay. That’s deep. Hold on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I’m gonna move you center to the camera and I’m gonna move out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Are you gonna have music? Can you have music and…?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Just tell the people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: The people. Okay. First, it’s my beliefs. Because I feel that my accomplishments don’t define who I am. That who I am is, is not attached to what I do, or what I accomplish, or even the things that I fail with or fail doing. Um, that’s a first one that, that who I am matters to the one that matters most to me. Um, and so, that, to me, that’s my guiding light in life, and so that’s how I approach most situations and I’m growing (obviously I’m not perfect, but that’s…that’s my beliefs). ‘Cause I feel like we talked about thoughts influence behaviors, but even before that I believe it’s beliefs. Um, belief about who you are and why you’re here. Um, that’s the first one, it’s like the deepest! The deepest one! Uh, the second one is, I believe it is in my personality to just do things. Um, when I was sixteen, my cousin/piano teacher, he wanted me to start teaching piano and I was like, “I’m sixteen years old. I don’t even know piano that well. I’m not that great.” And, um, a lady called me two days later and she’s like, “Hey! I heard that you give piano lessons and there’s two–I have two kids I want you to teach.” And I was like, “Well, I do now.” So, I took that, that way of just accepting things as they come, like the crazy (you know) man on the Internet that I was standing next to, um, that when opportunities come to you, when things that you learn come up, that you just embrace them. Kind of like what Chris always tells us: Embrace and pivot. But you can do that in your own life. And I, I do that in my own life. I embrace what comes and then I move forward. So, if you want it at the deepest level, that’s what…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @26:42&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Aren’t you scared?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Of what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I don’t know. Most people are afraid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I feel like this is weird ‘cause there’s just a voice coming in from the side! So you don’t wanna come back?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: It’s okay! Just look right there. Just pour your heart out and, right into that camera. Look right down the barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Say that question again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Aren’t you afraid? Like, why can you do what few people have been able to do? Besides saying, “Yeah! I just did it!” Help ‘em out!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @27:08&lt;br/&gt; [M]: Umm, there is fear there, but to me, for me, the excitement is…it overshadows the fear. And the other thing that I had mentioned to Chris before when he had asked me that, um, a big difference, too, for me this past year was, was being aware of what I’m thankful for, and that, um, what that looks like for me is sending two of my friends a gratitude list of three things I’m most thankful for every single day. Every single morning, no matter how bad our day was, no matter how bad we’re feeling, that we always send three things we’re grateful for. So one, it helps with accountability because you see that your friends are doing it, and we never bash each other if we forget, but it’s the fact that we see someone else doing it and then we do it as well. Um, the other thing is just sharing in gratitude and it changes your mind that you start actually looking for those things that you’re grateful for and that are good things instead of, um, I think are–it’s easy to get into that rut of naturally seeing what we suck at, and what went bad, and how someone treated us, and start blaming things, or people for what our life is right now, so doing the gratitude list has–I feel like it’s changed my brain, too, over the past few months since…I believe I started that like a couple weeks after I got coached by Chris. And that, coupled with just moving forward and doing it, and so when I, when I did the first strategy session with my client, I had to do my gratitude list the next day and so instead of thinking, “Oh, that went horribly, I did this wrong, and I should have done this, that I was just thinking of all the good things that came out of it. And I thought: “Oh my gosh! My client was excited.” And, they found out this about their business. And they did this and I was able to uncover this or make this connection, and so, I’m constantly now thinking in the positive light instead of the negative. So that’s a big one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; @29:03&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: That’s fantastic! That’s fantastic. So, you, you…how long ago did you graduate from school?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]:Ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Ten years. Okay. So that means a couple of things. That means you can be pretty set in your rhythms in life for ten years and have a change like that [*snaps his fingers*]. Yet the only thing that’s stopping you is you. And that’s why I’m just so appreciative of being able to watch you grow, to see you take on things and just…you know, I’mma give myself some credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Go for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I’m just gonna go and do one of these things [*pats himself on the back*]. I’mma, I’mma say something here, is: People always ask me: How do you determine who’s gonna be on the show? ‘Cause obviously there’s a lot of people who reach out and say, “Chris! Help us! Help us! Critique this! Help me! Coach me! Mentor me!” But you see, I, I pride myself on being able to spot talent. And talent isn’t necessarily what you guys think. Some of you guys might think, “Talent? Well, she has a giant Instagram following,” or “She’s already a design superstar.” And that’s not the case at all. What I saw in Melinda, which is very rare, is, I put out a task for people to do. The task was to draw grids over logos. And, what Melinda just exceeded my expectations in such a way that I was thinking: “Here’s a person who took a little bit of an idea, a kernel, and made it blow up.” So, this is a lesson to all of you guys that that kind of spirit is rewarded whether or not you have a mentor or not. So I think that that’s the kind of attitude that you have. Give you a little bit and you just take it and you run. Nose down, head down, and you just bash with the barriers, and I just love that. And I love that you just said that you’re really excited about the potential of what’s gonna happen, and you didn’t focus too much on what you had to lose. And that’s the key thing in life. Most people think about what they have to lose; few people think about what they have to gain. That’s what you did. Excellent job there. Okay. Now that you’re just killin’ it (Killin’ it!), what do we think, the end of 2018, what are you gonna do in terms of your gross billings? ‘Cause we had said before (at the end of 2017) you wish you could get this, and that freaked people out. They were like, “What’s she complaining about? That’s a ton of money!” Yes, relatively speaking, it is, relatively speaking, but we have goals. We set goals, we smash goals, we go to our stretch goals, so what is your goal for 2018 in terms of gross billings?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: A hundred and eighty thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Woohoo! A hundred and eighty thousand! It was a hundred before, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: It was a hundred before, until you told me to change it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: I did?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Yes, you did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Shh! We’ll edit that part out. I didn’t say it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Okay. Yes! It was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: A hundred and eighty THOUSAND. Boom! Now, I have to ask you a couple of questions. Back when you were going to–what school did you go to again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Cal State Fullerton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Cal State Fullerton, what up?! Cal State Fullerton! Did you think, in a year, you could possibly pull down a hundred and eighty thousand? Was that part of even your idea of what you could do as a graphic designer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: No. I’ve heard–well, in school, I did hear of people getting like hundred thousand rebrands, but that in my mind was for those top agency people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Like, it wasn’t…it wasn’t anything that I thought I could necessarily do, or…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Like, out of reach for mere mortals, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Alright, so you’re closing it. You have a killer attitude. You just, now you’re in the process of redesigning your website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Excellent. You’re doing everything that you need to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Is there anything else that we need to talk about before we kinda get into some coaching stuff?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: I wanna get into the coaching stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: You do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [M]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; [C]: Alright. We’re gonna get into some coaching stuff on the next episode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

We are live today on Facebook and Youtube! Hello, beautiful people! What are we going to be talking about today? Well, before I tell you, I just want to let you guys know I miss ya and I hope you missed us, and here we are back on the livestream. But! Back by popular demand, today we are going to be talking to Aaron Atchinson, he’s the founder of Farm Design based in Pasadena, and he is one of–he’s a man who has come from humble roots. Humble beginnings, and that’s his description, not mine. Now often times when we look at successful graphic designers and successful businesses, we make the assumption that it was preordained. That everything lined up for them and that that path was inevitable. This was most definitely not the case, so you guys are gonna want to definitely stay tuned to this because we’re gonna have a conversation with Aaron. He grew up in a town of 300 people. Small town. Stick around! Roll the titles!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[RAW Titles]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:36&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright, we’re back. Now you guys noticed I’m not in the black box. I’m sitting next to my good friend, and we are good friends. We’ve known each other for, I think somewhere close to 20 years if not longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Aaron Atchinson]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s been awhile. It’s been awhile, so, there’s a familiarity here, and I’ve been prodding and pulling and pushing and hoping and begging for Aaron to come on the show and do it live with us, and he finally agreed, so lots of things have changed in his life, but before we do that, let’s tell everybody who you are and let’s get back and rewind the tape if you will, let’s cut to my deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@2:08&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: This is Aaron Atchison, and he is the Founder of Farm Design. And if you guys want to look him up, what’s the web address?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: FarmDesign.net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Man, you sound good in that mic. Dang! Alright, anyways, you grew up in a small town called “Geraldine, Montana.” Tell me about Geraldine. What do you remember growing up there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Geraldine, Montana is in the central part of Montana, it’s a rural community, a farming community, a town (at that time, the population was 300–it’s actually, probably, maybe, far less than that now), but it was a lot of agriculture, um, built around community and the high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah. So there are–we have a picture of you, your brother, and your dad, you sitting on a boat in a lake somewhere, you shoveling something. What is, what are you shoveling there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That would be grain in a grain silo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s how much I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: A grain silo. Do you have any horror stories about the grain silo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: In the grain silo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Normally when you hop in those things, there’s like a ton of mice running around in there and, and I don’t like mice, so, you know, so we normally let the dogs in first and the dogs sort of scare all of the mice out and then we hop in there. That’s my horror story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, so as I mentioned, you grew up in a town of 300 people, high school population of…?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: The high school, 50 kids and my graduating class had 11 kids, but we had an exchange student, so, I would say, pretty much we had 10 from the time I moved there from when I was in 5th grade ‘till the time I graduated. So it was the same (basically), the same 10 students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, so, you go to high school and then you graduate. What did you study in school at Montana State?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I always wanted to be either a baker or an architect growing up. There was something–fascination I had with baking. I like baking pancakes in the morning, but I chose to become an architect so I went to Montana State University, which is in Bozeman, Montana, um, to study architecture initially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And, how does one who studies architecture at Montana State wind up in California doing graphic design?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That’s interesting. I was actually born in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh! You were?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So my brother, who’s a year older than myself, we were both born and raised in California. Uh, my mom was really young when she had two of us. Later I found out in life that she, she was 16 years old when she had two boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So, we actually moved around quite a bit as kids ‘cause my mom was trying to figure out where her path was and trying to just survive, and trying to figure out how to raise two young boys. So we moved around a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, we ultimately ended up (um, what I consider my hometown, which is in Montana). So we bounced around a lot, and we settled there when I was about ten years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah. So, um, she met a gentleman and they got married. His name is Larry Atchison, so I took on his last name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, but yeah, I think a lot of my, sort of, experiences in life, I refer back to that time that I lived when I was in Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Because I think I learned a lot of, like, discipline and a lot of the qualities that I sort of, I can attribute to growing up there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@5:14&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uh-hm. It must have been tough for you growing up because you, your mom was like in her teens…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And I imagine that there wasn’t a lot of money. You’ve told me stories about you actually having to go outside to go to the bathroom in what is referred to as an “outhouse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@5:26&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It’s still called an “outhouse.” Yes, but, we–I…one point we lived in a house where we didn’t have running water. And so, when you don’t have running water, you don’t have plumbing, and so we had an outhouse that you had to walk (I think it was maybe a hundred yards away). Which was terrible when it was snowing because then you always, like, in the middle of the night, you have to go to the bathroom. You have to go to the bathroom and then you throw on your sneakers and your hoodie and you run out through the snow but, yeah, it was–it was tough, but you know, when you’re a kid you don’t, you don’t think about those things. It’s just, it’s just the fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Do you have any horror stories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Horror stories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: About going to the bathroom and there’s a raccoon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Oh gosh, no. Nothing quite like that. I always feared there was something actually in the outhouse. Like, you know, but nothing. Nothing like that. So I–fortunately no horror stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Like there wasn’t a pennywise holding a red balloon in a hole and saying, “Come here!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: No?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No. Not in the country. Yeah, clowns are smarter than that. They don’t move out in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: They only hang out in suburban neighborhoods under the city. Okay, luckily for you. What–I mean, I can’t even fathom this. Look, I grew up kind of poor, too, but just not even having running water…how do you wash your hands and what does it even, how does it even work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@6:38&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, wow. There was actually a creek, and the creek was maybe 300 yards away, and so part of growing up is my brother and I, we always had chores, and the first thing I had to do waking up in the morning was start the fire, ‘cause we didn’t have heating. We didn’t have centralized heating so, we had to like chop wood and we had to start the fire to heat the house up. So I had to wake up at (I think around) 6:30, start the fire, that was my responsibility, and then to get water, we had these um, buckets (and I think they were maybe like 3 or 4 pound buckets), and I at the time probably weighed 70 pounds soaking wet, so I was, I was tiny. And then we had to go out to the creek, then we’d have to–a little pull, and we’d pull it up, and we’d carry it back to the house so–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: A lot of hard work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Boil water and, um, if you’ve ever seen “Hee-Haw” (which I’m kind of dating myself), like, there are scenes in there where they would bathe and they were sitting there in like a big, um, stainless steel, um, bucket, and they’re bathing themselves with a ladle. That’s how we literally bathed. And we didn’t do it all the time because it was, it took a lot of effort, so, um, we, oftentimes we bathed once a week. It was very challenging! But it was, it was just the way of life! And it was like, you didn’t know any different. It was, it was actually pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@7:55&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It sounds a little bit like now from thinking about it, it sounds like camping. So for the first part of your life, you were just camping all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: We were, yeah. We were always camping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C] Was it fun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was a lot of fun! You know, it was uh, ‘cause there was a creek that ran out in front of a house that we lived in and we’d go out and we would go fishing and we’d bring the fish back in and that what we’d have for dinner. And we’d cook it right then and there. Um, so, yeah. And you were outside a lot and there’s animals, and I’m an animal person, so we had horses and cows and dogs and yeah, it was just, being outside and exploring. When you’re a kid, you’re just constantly, you’re curious and you’re exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@8:31&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. Let’s get you to California. And we’re gonna speed up the timeline here a little bit because I really do want to get into some of the mindset stuff that we’re going to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@8:38&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You’re in California now, what brings you out to California?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@8:42&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: You know, okay, so, I went to Montana State University initially to study architecture. Um, I still had family here in California so, um, during the summers I would normally go and visit them and um, they would take us to like Disneyland and uh, then I was introduced to surfing, so, during the summers I would surf as much as possible. Um, but I really made the big transition when I discovered–at the time I didn’t know what it was called, but it was graphic design. Graphic design I had no idea what it was, I didn’t really know what a logo was, um, growing up in the country, they’re just, you’re not exposed to a lot of media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, so when I was at the university, there was like these, some wacky kids, uh, at a department next to the architecture department, and they were doing some wacky stuff, and they were putting stuff on the walls, and I’d walk past their, um, their uh, studio space and I’d poke my head in and one day they were painting pizza boxes and it really piqued my interest. I’m like, “What are they painting pizza boxes for?” I walked in there and they were telling me they were designing logos and boxes, so I wanted to learn more, and it sparked my interest because I liked the simplicity and how impactful a logo and packaging could be. So that sort of led me to my next career path as um, or, in school rather is, I decided I’m going to move to California, change majors, mainly so I can surf in California, and then I, uh, I went to Cal State University, Northridge, uh, where I studied art with an emphasis in graphic design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@10:17&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Now, I’m going to spare you guys all the kind of details but, you started out in, in your home studio doing design and you’ve been doing that for quite some time. Now you and I met under kind of strange circumstances. I’m gonna let the guys know out in the audience here. We met through a mutual friend, a former employee of mine who said like, “I know you love to play Halo, Chris, so come and I’m gonna bring my buddy in. “And I know you’re a super competitive guy, I won’t get into all the juicy details, but we would all bring our X-Boxes together and, and do a LAN party and play Halo together. And that’s really how I got to know you. And I remember, there’s a couple times we wanted to play, so I would just grab my X-Box and go meet you up at your house and we’d plug the things in. I–we would go into one room and we’d have these LAN parties and just do battle for lunch and unplug and just run back to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And I didn’t know you that well at the time. You were just that guy in the other room that I just wanted to kill. And so Halo is like one of those sports like–and you were probably equally as competitive. And so, I would come visit my friend and I would come to your office and you guys would actually print out sort of like…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Floorplans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Floorplans of the maps of Halo and you guys were strategizing. You had like rulers and lines, like you’d go here and here. I’m like, “This guy is intense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Isn’t that how everybody plays Halo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No, just you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: We weren’t going to lose, so that’s really how we got our start, but as our kind of casual friendship built up around gaming and just competing, and then I started to learn more about you and your design practice, and I’m gonna get you guys to 2008 a little bit right now. Okay? So let’s look at 2008. This is the studio in which you worked out of?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, I…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Talk to us about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@11: 56&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, just, uh, after I graduated college, um, I got a job as a creative director at a small agency in Culver City, here in Los Angeles. So I worked there for 5 years. Um, I sort of cut my teeth sort of learning the principles of design, and working with clients, and, uh, working with vendors. I, I learned a lot. It was, it was uh, a fantastic experience in my life. In 2000 I decided I was gonna, I was gonna branch out and I was gonna do my own thing and so I had a spare bedroom in my apartment, um, and so I converted that spare bedroom into my studio, if you will, and really it was just a computer on a desk. Um, I, I was, I had enough confidence in my ability and skill level and I had some relationships and I had some small clients, so I’m like: “Okay, I’m going to take that leap of faith.” I had a little bit of money in the bank account (I think, uh, at that time, I had literally 9,000 dollars in my account), so I said–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was pretty good! I figured that I could live without any income coming in for three months and so I kind of had a time scale, like, “Okay, if this is going to happen, I, I gotta make it happen in three months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And how old are you at this point? Do you remember?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, I was exactly 30. It was on my 30th birthday, I’m like, “I’m leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Wow. Okay. And what year is this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh, 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Well, interesting. Alright, I’m trying to map your timeline, as to kind of, well…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I took the 7-year plan in, in college if you’re doing the math. But, yeah…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@13:23&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, let’s look at some of the work. So it makes sense to hear your story about your love of surfing and outdoors and just be, you’re kind of into sports and you’re an athlete and competition, and this is kind of…&lt;br/&gt;[A] Yeah, that’s where my passion was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385c3cdbce3e_AaronAtchison_work1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, this is a time capsule into kind of the work that you were doing. And I remember talking to you at this point in time, and, I’m going to tell a little story you guys. So here’s my, here’s my story. I’m over at Aaron’s house and he’s showing me the work that he’s doing and he’s talking about doing work with new clients, and I remember you were showing me this very ornate packaging you were putting together. I remember this, and you were going to ship this to whatever, or self-promo pieces, and I had asked you at this time, “Aaron, why don’t you get an intern in here to do this? There’s somebody else that could be doing this while you do the high-level stuff.” And I remember your response. Do you remember it, or should I tell this part?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, I didn’t listen to you much back then, so, you were my mortal enemy, so, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: How am I your–?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Refresh my memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Hold on. How am I your mortal enemy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I do remember you telling me I should do a lot of things to improve what I, my practice, right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Basically it was me giving you valuable advice that just hit you like a rock and fell on the floor, at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Pretty much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@14:33&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Your response to me was: “Hey, Chris. If I don’t do this, what else am I going to be doing? And, I don’t know, I’m just a simple guy, I just want to do the work, I see something that needs to get done and I just do it. Why would I hire anybody else to do this? What else am I gonna do?” And I remember telling you, “Well, you should be working on your business and not in your business. Be thinking about how to grow and scale.” And do you remember that now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I do remember and I think a lot of those, um, the way I was brought up growing up on a farm is like you’d…work had to be done, you just rolled, rolled your sleeves up and you got out there and you did the work. And so, when I started my practice, I still had that sort of mindset where things had to be done (I knew how to do them), and so I just rolled my sleeves up and did it. You were always, you were always sort of, kind of like that uncle that always wanted to like give me advice and I, I think I was pretty stubborn back then (still a little stubborn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I just want to say for the record: A younger uncle, please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Perhaps, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Don’t paint me into that picture. Just a younger uncle. The younger, cooler uncle. Keep going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: But when you said, uh, back when I first started my practice and you saw me sort of doing all these little, little tasks when you said, “You need, you should outsource that, or you should get someone to help you.” Uh, for me, I was not afraid of hard work, so I kinda didn’t understand your principles. I also was always concerned that I would be giving away something…um, I always wanted to be close to my craft, and I always, I love designing and having my hands on things and working, so, for me it’s like it didn’t feel like work so it didn’t feel like I was, I needed to give away anything. I wasn’t that busy all the time anyway, and I think that to your point is, so, it’s like, “Well I have the extra time and if I didn’t have extra time, I would just stay up later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So that was always just, that was my mentality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, so some people are guessing correctly how old Aaron is. I’m not going to tell you, but you can do the math. Now, I remember also talking to you because you would work really hard, and I’m, I would never accuse you of not working hard, but maybe I would accuse you of not working as smart as you need to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And I remember then, for periods of time you would just disappear. You would disappear and go surfing in Costa Rica, and you’d go on these epic adventures, meanwhile I was toiling away kind of in the factory, if you will. I remember saying this to you one time, I was like: “Aaron, I think you suffer from ‘Peter Pan’ syndrome. Like, you never want to grow up. You’re still doing projects–” (now, we’re in our 40s at this point, I think).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No, we’re in our late thirties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Late thirties?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Careful, we were in our thirties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: We’re in our late thirties, and I was telling you, “Like, you work on projects that I think 18, 19, 22-year-old kids would love to work on.” Uh, action, sports-oriented things and brands, and I remember you working on certain events that was kind of like–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Like X-Games type of stuff. Yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And, the other part to it was not only just reflected in the clients that you were working with and the things that connected and resonated with you, but, this idea that you would work and then you would disappear. You would just plan these trips and you would just disappear, and, and, and you liked the idea that you could pick up and go wherever you wanted, kind of in this more “transitory-transient” lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And, I said to you, “One day, when you want to focus on your business, your life will change and it will change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And what was your thought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think that my thought process during those, those years–I think–and it was right around from 2000 and 2008 was when I was a solo, solo designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: “Solopreneur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@18:02&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: “Solopreneur,” sort of working out my, my, my practice out of my home. My, my philosophy at the time was: I have skill and I’m willing to work hard, and, I had a certain level of success early on. I had certain clients and I would look at the bank account and I’d see the money coming in and, and it was pretty decent. You know? It was anywhere between 50 thousand to 90 thousand–was probably one of my best years. So that’s where the range was, and for me that was really good. And so I had this philosophy: I’m gonna–as long as I’m hitting a certain number, then whatever time I have leftover, I’m gonna experience things in life. So I would travel, um, so yeah. It was very much sort of a, sort of a “fixed” mindset. I wasn’t looking at [the] “big picture,” I was sort of “living in the now,” and I would look at your career and I saw you working so hard, like, always working, and I was the antithesis of that. I’m like, “Chris, why aren’t you enjoying life? Have you ever traveled out of the country?” And you were like, “There will be a time for that.” And I thought you were crazy. I’m like, “I’m not gonna be young for the rest of my life. I want to experience these things while I can still move.” And, so that was my philosophy. So–and it worked for me for a while, you know? I was like, I was getting clients, the money was okay, I was able to support myself. Um…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: But before we get into that, I want to dwell on this for a little bit because the reason why–and some of you guys that are tuning in or watching this later will realize really quickly–the reason why I brought Aaron on the show was because he can speak to and relate to so many things that you guys think. So here we are: We’re two contrasting personalities. You, you come–we’re both, we, we came out of the world kinda poor, and we worked our way out of it, but you came from a really small town, some financial hardships, and some, some family life that was less than ideal, but you worked through all that stuff, right? You made it work, and–but there was this idea of you just wanting to be (this is where we differ) this “solopreneur,” doing the work yourself and doing it all by yourself, and having great pride in being able to do it, and then saying, “What’s wrong with you? Why don’t you want to enjoy your life and I can’t see that. You’re like probably just grinding away at the, in the salt mine, kind of in the cubicle, if you will,” even though I didn’t work in a cubicle. And on the flipside, I’m over here thinking, “This guy has so much potential. He could do so many things but he just needs to learn to grow up at some point in his life.” And I’m just using it in the broadest sense, like, you’re a mature person, but I was just thinking: “Why doesn’t your work evolve? Like, my work doesn’t look the same as it did just a few years ago, let alone when I was in my 20s. I needed to do work that was going to be appealing to companies that could afford to pay me what I wanted to be paid.” I just want to get a little bit of your mindset. How you viewed yourself versus me and just, this is your opportunity to just dog on me if you want (at that point in time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@21:01&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah. I, I think…I, I think a lot of my motivation was: “I’m just gonna work hard.” And that’s where it came from my childhood and growing up on a farm, it was like, “That’s gonna get me through tough times. It’s like, just the solution is just to work really hard.” And, and I did–I wasn’t looking very, sort of, proactively, like, “What’s gonna happen long-term?” Uh, because I had a certain level of success early on, um, branching out as a solopreneur, I thought that was it, like, it was just things were gonna happen and materialize and it was just gonna happen. I was just a lot of–a lot of things were very reactive, um, where the clients came in, um, and how I adjusted with those clients, but, it wasn’t until, you know, I fell on some hardships where it made me sort of reanalyze who I was as a person, uh, especially at that time in my life where, uh, now I’m in my late 30s, I, I expected a, you know, a certain level of success and, and comfort, and, you know, having stability and um, finances, stability in sort of my relationships and really, I started to uncover that I didn’t have a lot of these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And that’s when there was that, that “oh crap” moment, and um, that sort of come-to-Jesus, like, “Uh, maybe I do need to grow up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@22:14&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well let’s talk about that. So this is where I think we wanted to kind of pivot and we can circle back, you guys, if you want to ask those question on Facebook and on YouTube that we have two guys in the other room, along with Erica, Emmanuel, and Sam (two interns joining us here). So they’ll be monitoring your comments and you guys lets me know if you hear a really good question, okay? Feel free, feel free to interrupt us. Let’s talk about this point of, of change in your life. What happened here? So, I think if you guys were paying attention, if you were alive during this time in 2008, basically the, the bottom of the universe opened up as far as it’s concerned with the financial market. People were committing suicide, stocks (like Apple stock was like at 18 dollars a share), everybody thought the total economy was going to collapse and it impacted so many businesses (ours, too). And so let’s, let’s talk a little bit about 2018, uh 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@23:02&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, so I think my, my business and myself was really just kind of on cruise-control, and things were fine, you know, there was money in the bank and, um, I was living the life I wanted to live. I had a lifestyle that I enjoyed, and then I think it was around 2007 is when the, the housing market sort of burst and the stock market went kind of, kind of went bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: The subprime…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Right? And what happened is, clients, the phone stopped ringing, and that was when, um, I saw the bank account starting to dwindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: How much was in the bank account at this point in time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: You know, I, I think I was always right around anywhere from 5 to 20 thousand dollars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And–but that was fine when money was continually coming through, but then once the phone stopped ringing, uh, I had to re-evaluate what was happening. Um, I think a lot of my clients, uh, they would keep the work in-house now because their marketing budgets were a lot tighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Uh, companies or start-ups who were thinking about bringing something to market, they didn’t have that luxury anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: They didn’t have financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Banks didn’t loan any money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, and so there was just, absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, money dried up all over the place and I think I remember, too, two of your bigger clients in the action-sports space, they had problems financially, too, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, I think, uh, in the action-sports industry, I did a lot of, um, lifestyle brands, um, action-sports and their sponsors stopped sponsoring the events, and so, those events just, they just disappeared. Another big client I had at the time I had a retainer with (Honda motorcycles), and so retainer is they, they had a one-year contract and I would get paid monthly, so it was kinda like a salary, so it was that stability. Um, they stopped having work because they then tightened-up their budget and kept everything in-house, and so then that was that moment where I needed to figure out what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@25:01&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well this kind of stuff doesn’t happen overnight. There’s a slow progression or, it might feel like it happens overnight, but–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It felt like it happened overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right. Like, one client calls you and says, “Aaron, it’s been great working with you, but we can’t do this anymore.” There goes Honda. The action sports guys say, “We can’t do the next event this year, all our sponsors pulled out.” And, slowly but surely you start to see that 20 thousand become 18, becomes 12, becomes 8…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And so talk to me. When did it hit rock bottom for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It, it was pretty quick. Um, I knew that (I mean), I probably started living beyond my means (‘cause I had a nice car)–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@25:37&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And I, I was more concerned about status and what people thought of me, so I, I kind of was–had a certain lifestyle that I was used to living. Eating out, dressing a certain way, um, and so when I couldn’t afford to do those things, and the money wasn’t coming in, that’s when I’m like: “Okay, what do I do now? Do I, do I actually brush off my résumé and look for another job?” And I had a lot of pride because I sort of had a certain level of success with Farm Design and, um, I’d built something. To feel like I had to let that go and, you know, suck up my pride and go on interviews again, it was really tough. And I actually did that. I had to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You, you put together your resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I put together my portfolio, I put–uh, I rewrote my résumé, um, this is my late 30s now and I was going to, I went to a couple job interviews and I never got the work. I’m like, “Wait, wait a minute. I thought my stuff was pretty good.” But, they weren’t hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Why do you think that was?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think everyone was starving. Everyone was hungry, everyone was looking for work. Uh, they had to be über selective about who they picked because, you know, they probably had limited resources as well and maybe I just didn’t fit. I think also maybe my portfolio was very one-dimensional, but that worked for me in terms of my business model. I focused heavily on, uh, an action-sports sort of “youth-lifestyle” sort of. That’s who I appealed to, those are the type of clients I appealed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: How did that make you feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@27:13&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Uh, pretty inferior, actually. Um, it, it, it made me think and it kept me up late at night, uh, just wondering like okay, what did I do wrong? Um, you know. The fear of, “Can I make my car payment? Can I, can I pay for rent? What is my girlfriend gonna think?” It’s, it’s those sort of things, like, it can emasculate you, so, yeah. I think, you know, I–that was the time when I like, really hit rock bottom. It wasn’t fun. It was scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I can, I can only imagine. I mean, even the act of putting together your résumé, not as a design exercise, but because you actually have to go out and get work, that just must have been hard to say, like, “Okay, it was a good run. It’s been 8 or so years and it’s been great, and now I have to change and everything is changing and…did you start to regret some of the decisions that you made prior to that point? Because sometimes when you’re in that dark place–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: –you ask, “Why did I buy that expensive car? What, why did I not take that opportunity, or there was that one client that I could have done something different from but I walked away ‘cause I was too or what. I don’t know what it was. I’m just…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, I don’t think I regretted the decisions I made with my business. I, I look back at it as a learning experience, like, “Okay, I probably should have done something different. Um, I, I certainly (I think with a lot of people) lived beyond my means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, having a nice car and living a certain way, and at the end of the day, what does that all really mean? It’s, it’s superficial. And it took sort of hitting that rock-bottom to start to see those things, and re-evaluate and, um, assess who I was and, and if I needed to change my mindset to sort of right the ship because everything was, like, the business, the accounting, the–my relationships, it was like, it all kind of like came to a head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Did it cause friction in your relationship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It certainly didn’t help. Yeah. Um, because we split all of the–at the time, I was in a long relationship as well, and I think I wasn’t–probably it was a 15-year relationship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And so, why didn’t I commit to that person, so I think there was a lot of things I didn’t want to grow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So, you know, that whole “Peter Pan” syndrome thing. It, it affected everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: If the label fits you well. I know you resented me even throwing that at you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I didn’t even know what that meant when you brought it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I made it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Peter Pan. Peter Pan never grows up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That was me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Wow, okay, so if you guys want to get the razor blades out, now would be a good time to actually put them away ‘cause we’re gonna, we’re gonna pivot. There’s a reason why Aaron is here. I wanted him, and I’ve encouraged him to just kind of open his heart and share some of the pain points there because what happens next, I think we can learn a lot from. Now if we had a commercial break, this is when I would cut to a commercial break, but we don’t, so we’re gonna keep going!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s how we roll. Okay, so I’m gonna bring up this slide here, and I remember you doing this (I have my thoughts and opinions on this as well), but you started another business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Let me, let me just set the stage and then you, you take it from there. So, so here you are, you can’t get clients because you actually didn’t build a sales pipeline or sales or marketing strategy and all the things that you had done in the past, are no longer applicable because there are too many buyers and too few sellers. Oh, I’m sorry, let me say that the opposite: There are too few buyers and too many sellers of work, and so, you went out and tried to get a job. You did the whole resume dog-and-pony show and you weren’t able to get the work either, so now it’s like, what does a person do? And you got pushed into a pretty tight corner. This is when you started a company called “Mugo,” a portable MP3 music player–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: –that was kind of tapping into a big trend, and the trend was custom-vinyl-artwork, built around artists that have a following. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Take it away from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@31:03&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, I, I think when I, when I was at that place in my career, I…I, I had to make a decision: Do I just bury my head in the sand and just, you know, did I fail or do I try to learn from my mistakes and do something with it? And when the opportunities weren’t knocking, they say to build a door and so because no one else was calling me, that I felt like I needed to create my own opportunities. Um, I took a lot of the lessons, uh, I realized I learned a lot, design, doing branding for my clients in helping them build something. Seeing their vision come to fruition. Um, so I’m like, “Well I need to take the lessons that I have, the skills that I have, the foundation and do that for myself.” So I was very passionate about music and collecting vinyl toys, which, you know, I think I probably got a lot from you because you collect a lot of vinyl toys as well and I think I got that inspiration and I, I created this thing called a “Mugo” and what my goal was to bring a product to market. I didn’t know what I was doing. It was all just by the seat of my pants. Um, literally, uh, designed something, um, try to figure out how to find, uh, vendors and manufacturers. I knew that I needed to go to China because looking for local vendors, it was too expensive and the price-point wasn’t right, so like, how do I find vendors in Asia? And then, so a lot of this stuff was incredibly reactive, but I had a goal, like I needed to create another sort of income source. I’m gonna create my own business, separate from branding. And that’s what Mugo was. Um, and that was probably a two-year “labor of love,” getting that thing. Trying to get it off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, and then, sort of, in the middle, there’s occasionally those small little projects that might come in, but I was, I was–that whole time–I was, everything was running on fumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I remember. So sometimes…a wise friend could come in and offer you advice, and you would ignore it because of our competitive spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@33:07&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And then, sometimes life sends you another message, knocking at your door, and pulls the rug out from underneath you, and you can’t attribute these…the “global forces at work,” if you will–this whole “subprime market,” it just “bottomed-out” as something that is a consequence of your action, things just do happen, but then it’s in those moments you learn that, “Oh, we didn’t prepare that emergency earthquake kit. Oh, snap! Now we gotta go do something about it.” And you tried one thing after the other, and, where is it in this part of your journey is it that you start to make these kind of fundamental changes that lead you to kinda where we’re gonna take this conversation in a little bit. What happened? Can you, can you remember? What were the triggers and how did your mindset change? Because so much of what we try to teach on this show is about “mindset.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@33:57&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah. I, I think one thing that I took from my childhood, and my, my growing up on a farm and an agricultural community is, uh, my father always taught us to, sort of, “feed the soil and not the plant.” And it was a very literal uh, um, lesson that he was trying to teach us. And what that, what that meant was, in, in order for the crop to thrive is you really need to put your focus on the soil. And, so, he taught us how to fertilize the soil, how to do crop rotation, so all of these things it was, was putting the focus on, on a foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@34:35&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And, and if you focus on the foundation, then that crop will thrive and you’ll be sustainable. If you, if you lose focus on that foundation or the soil in this metaphor, um that’s, that plant will eventually wither and die. So, when I was going through this transition, I, I was–uh–reminded of that lesson and, and used it as a metaphor that I think what I had spent so much of my time focusing on was, like myself and what I thought other people, um, wha–the importance of what they thought of me, the type of car I drove, the type of clothes I wore–and I focus more I guess on the plant, and I didn’t focus on the foundation. So, I shifted, needed to shift in my mindset to, um, thinking in a belief system that is more long-term and more foundational. So by developing something like creating my own product as something that, um, I can put a lot of the, the work into creating it. But then that would have sort of long-term effects in terms of sales, and the lessons that I learned from that I can parlay that into other opportunities. Um, and I think that’s what truly happened when I, when I started to do that–is that other opportunities came out through this experience. Uh, opportunities that I didn’t even foresee, but um, but then I sort of grasped those opportunities, and I think that’s when things started to happen. The big shift was, in conjunction with Mugo ‘cause I had to fund that and I had to just survive, is I needed to decide like, “How am I going to grow my business?” if that’s what I wanted to do. And I was reminded of, of what you always told me is like, I think there was, there was someone you met. There was a kid you met at a portfolio review and you called me up and you said, “Hey, there’s this kid, you know, he’s, he’s okay. I, I liked his energy. Give him a call. Um, try him out as an intern. Just give him one day a week.” And, you know, at that point, it’s like, I have nothing to lose. And so, I actually listened to you that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: The one time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: The one time–or maybe the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@36:44&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was the first time. And so, uh, I called him, he came in and I interviewed him, and his portfolio was, you know, it was average, but I, I did like his energy, and so I said, “Okay, I’m gonna take this leap of faith, I don’t know how I’m gonna pay for this kid, you know, it was 10 dollars an hour, and so I said, “Well, what if I, if I fed you lunch everyday, too, would, does that sound appealing?” And he said–he was as hungry as I was. So I, I hired him, and I said, “Let’s come in, let’s try two days a week.” And he didn’t have a vehicle, and he drove a bus, it took him 2 to 2 and a half hours just to get to my place, so I knew that he was really passionate and hungry as well. So what I started to see is this, what I thought as like, maybe this kid can help me with small little tasks and errands, is what it did is it really sort of lit a fire and it re-sort of, um, brought the passion back and the energy for my craft as a designer because, uh, he would come in and I would give him tasks and I would teach him certain things and I could see the look on his face when I would teach him these things, and, and that sort of, sort of fueled my fire, and then, surprisingly what I did not expect, is he taught me a lot of things–’cause I had way too much pride. I thought I knew everything. I thought I knew everything. But he taught me a lot of things, and that’s when I sort of had a really big pivot point in my career and my life and um, looking at myself like, you know, maybe I don’t know everything. Maybe I need to re-look at this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@38:15&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I-I look at my career when I was a, a solopreneur, and I look at it as, as I was a–really a small plant in a small pot. I was this one guy in my apartment, working in this little room, wake up and I’d go to the room and I’d do my work. I was a plant in a small pot, and what I needed to do was focus on that foundation and, and grow that foundation, so I needed to get a bigger pot, so I could allow sort of my roots to grow. So, I got another computer, um, I got another workstation, I got the intern and we started doing stuff and things started happening. I didn’t know what it was, but I just knew something was different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm. Okay. Let’s hold that thought for a second here. I want to que up Emmanuel and Sam and, and Erica. If you guys have any questions, get your questions ready. I just want to read some comments from the livechat. People are saying: (This is Akman Raw–I don’t know how to say your name, but he’s like) “I’ve learned so much within the last 30 minutes.” So thank you for saying that. People are saying, “This is amazing.” Uh, “Salut.” “Teach and learn, Farm Design.” Uhh, “Amazing, you guys.” “Check it out.” “Mind blown.” So some good energy coming in. I wanted to share that with you so you could feel some of the audience feedback. Uh, uh I have tons of thoughts and ideas and questions to kind of dive in, but I’mma kick it out to the new dream team. New dream team, you got any questions or comments about this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Emmanuel] We have a question from Lallitz Gallery, umm, he’s asking, “How does a solopreneur handle his/her company during a recession?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I think you’re hearing it right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I believe you’re exactly hearing the story of how a solopreneur handles their company during a recession. And we’re gonna talk a little bit more about that so let’s okay, that’s a good question. Anything else? Anything? You guys can ask your own question, you guys. As you’re listening to the story, both of you guys are graphic designers. Emmanuel, raise your hand so people know who you are. So Emmanuel’s from, from, from Italy. From Milan?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, so, it’s ironic that you’re here and I’ll be going to Milan in a couple of weeks. That’s kind of weird. You come and I–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: I’ve been waiting for you for ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I’m sorry. And then Sam. Sam’s from Art Center, right? You’re studying graphic design. What, what term and major are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Sam]: Um, I’m about 8th term at Art Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh! You’re about to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: Yeah. So, haha. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, any questions so far, you guys? As you’re hearing Aaron just pour his heart out here, just on the table and the floor! You got anything for us? Erica, I, I hear, I hear you smiling and laughing in the background, so, what’s, what’s resonating and what’s connecting with you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Erica]: Uh, well mostly I’m focusing on the edit…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: But, it is really great to hear a story, um, of how someone got started and the troubles they went through, and how they realized their mindset, and I’m looking forward to, to more of it, even though half of my attention is mostly on the edit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, okay. But I, I hear your smiling and laughing at the key moments. Uh, when I make my little jokes and insert the jabs, so I, I know you’re paying attention. Okay. Anyways, people are wondering what happened to Aaron and Molly. Are they gone forever? And yes, they are gone forever. Or have they been shipped off to another country? No, they’re in the other room, working very hard, you guys. Just relax. We’re bringing in lots of different kinds of people, different energy for the topics that are relevant to them and what they’re passionate about. So let’s talk a little bit about this, so, before we kind of just broke away for a moment from the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@41:39&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You’re kind of in this dark place. You don’t know what else to do. So you wind up bringing in somebody to help you. And I have to imagine, because I think we had these conversations before, and this is gonna touch upon a lot of what our audience is gonna feel. So when you’re not successful, you feel like, “Well who am I to take on people and to mentor? Like, I’m not even worthy of doing that. And, I’m barely making it as it is, financially. How can I afford to bring in another person? What are they gonna do for me? I don’t have any work to do, what the heck are they gonna do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right? Does that sound about fair?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It’s pretty fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, now so despite all that, you finally, finally let some words of wisdom trickle into the thick skull. And you actually do bring in a kid. You bring in a kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@42:22&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And it was very generous of you, actually, because a lot of people do unpaid internships, and for you even to say, “Look, I, I, I’ll pay you hourly and then I’ll buy your lunch,” because you’re a good guy. So if you have a loaf of bread, I think you’re the type of guy who doesn’t just cut half and give it to his employee. You cut whatever you think the employee needs and you eat the crumbs that are leftover. So kudos to you, you’re a good, you’re a good man, Charlie Brown. You are. Okay? So you bring in a guy and you start to learn how to delegate. You learn how to collaborate. You learn how to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@42:55&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And most importantly, you’re, you’re teaching and you’re sharing what you know. And this is what they, they always say (like, teachers say this and it’s a cliché, but it’s totally true): “You learn more from the student than they will ever learn from you.” And, and I wanna explain that a little bit, but I don’t want to explain it. I want you to do it. Like, what do you mean when you say that, like, you didn’t realize you would learn so much by actually having somebody that you were gonna teach?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@43:21&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think it’s interesting…um, teaching someone things that you know. First of all, I really didn’t think I knew that much. I think I had certain levels of skill, but I say, “If you’ve been paying attention in life, you should’ve, you should learn something.” And so, having someone there where you can bounce ideas off and, and share information you realize, um, how much you actually do know. And then it starts a conversation. And that conversation stimulates and challenges each other, and I think that’s what it, it–one of the challenges of working by yourself is, “Who’s there to challenge yourself?” It’s like, do you have that intern–, that internal sort of voice that, that can do it for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@44:02&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So, having an intern or a student there who can, that can challenge you on your thoughts, who can bring new, uh, dialogue and information to the table, I think is what really started to, um, where I started to grow up as a person…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A] And made me want to learn more so I can share more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And so, we started with that collaboration. Between the two of us, uh, I, I think, I felt like I was becoming a better person and more knowledgeable, and I could see him, he was always there on time, everyday, the front door, ready to go, to, to the next task and so, that just sparked the fuel even more, and like, “Okay, where do I take this? What’s the next step?” And so I brought in another intern because the work started picking up. Um, and so I brought in another person. At that point I, I had moved and I had a house…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And, um…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So we’re gonna, we’re gonna talk. We’re gonna do the transition talk right now? Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Roughly, but I think it’s, it’s important because, uh, I, I had a garage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So, I moved out of the apartment with the spare bedroom and I now had a house with a garage…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@45:19&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And a yard. And, I put in more computers. And so I’m like: “Okay.” I felt comfortable bringing that one person on. So little baby steps, little progressions, sort of, uh, scaffolding my, uh, my efforts and, and trying to build for something greater. Uh, I didn’t want to jump in head-first. I was doing little baby steps, but at least I was moving forward with the goal that I needed to do something where I can be sustainable and something that I can have to grow my business, and um, and my career. So I hired another employee. Um, it was my–it started out as an internship, uh, she was fantastic, and so I offered her a job after a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: But we were in the garage! And, it was difficult–I was surprised that she took the job offer because it’s like, this person who just graduated school, who I thought was incredibly talented, why would she want to come and work in my garage? So she saw something, I think in me, perhaps? I think she saw something in, in my vision, like how I wanted to grow the business, and so I needed to get that bigger pot, and so I took another leap of faith, and I got an office space in Old Town Pasadena. So, it scared me to death because now I have more expenses, more overhead, I have to pay for rent and utilities, and more computers, and the salary, um, so, it’s, it’s pushing me out of my comfort zone is really what allowed me to start to grow and, and, um, mature as an individual, and mature as a business owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm. Okay, so, we’re gonna cut to my slides here. This is where Aaron’s office is now, right on the main strip in Old Town Pasadena. It’s right on Colorado. He’s right there above the Vans shoe store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Vans Shoes and…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah. And something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It’s that second floor there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And Lush. And you can see him on the second floor there with the orange lights. And I’m gonna show you guys a little about his office space. And he’s gone through some expansion. Uh, you’ve knocked out some walls and kind of moved–opened up your office, and soon, I think, you’ll probably outgrow that office, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right? That’s a probability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That pot is probably…I’m out growing that pot, and so I’ll probably need to get a bigger pot. So, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, it needs to just continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So here, you can see Aaron with his dog, Shelly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Shelby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Shelby! And, and some of his staff. Alright. And now we’re gonna look at some of his work…I know the Internet is really smart, so all our fans are probably already crawling all over your Behance site or on your website itself–uh, your website proper. But let’s take a look at some of your work. So, now you’re in the food and bev space and you’re doing really well. You’re killin’ it. You’re, you’re branding some really awesome restaurants and, just, really fun “dream” projects, if you will. Doing things from (What is this?) Craft Cider, and to Cold Brew Coffee from Califa, Califia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Calif-fee-ya?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Calif-fee-ya, thank you. And then doing coffee packaging for Static.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And some fashion stuff, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@48:22&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: You’ll start to notice that I transitioned away from youth-lifestyle, and into…um, a portfolio that can appeal to clientele that probably could afford to pay us, that I can afford to pay my staff, and so, in order for me to do that, I had to get out of my comfort zone of doing what I knew, while I needed to–we needed to craft a portfolio that can attract clients that we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And so…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I feel like I’ve heard that before. How…I can’t put my…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: …finger on it. I just…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think I came up with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, probably. Okay, keep going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: But I think uh, from a lot of your audience, it’s like, how do you get to that next level? How, how do you attract a certain clientele?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@49:05&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And, I, I learned this from students, is, uh, I would ask–be asked to do a lot of portfolio reviews at my alma mater at Cal. State Northridge and AIGA, and, there was always–I’d get the portfolio from the student and it would be their–they would show work from school task, and it, the projects that they were probably the most proud of were something that was actually, they, did in real life that was actually printed, but oftentimes those projects weren’t that good. It’s like: “Oh, I designed this logo and this brochure for a bank,” for example, and I’m looking at–the design is not that great, but they think it’s the best piece in their portfolio because it was actually printed, or there was an actual client. And so, I, I learned from that, that, you know,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@49:49&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I don’t think you have to show something that you actually did, I’d rather you, you show me something that’s, uh, exemplifies your capabilities and your design skills. So if that means you have to do something on your own, or if, if you’re in class and your professor gives you a project, do the project, but then go the next step, and, and expand on that project and that system, uh, for your portfolio. So from that lesson (‘cause I didn’t want to look at projects that didn’t appeal to me), so when I started, uhh, sort of “Farm Design 2.0,” and I have employees, like, we needed to like, um, attract a new clientele, so we asked ourselves, “What sort of clients do we want to attract?” And we would, we were interested in maybe doing some sort of beverage company, we liked coffee, so, and we liked restaurants, so I tasked the, um, my employees, “Okay, let’s come up with a hypothetical project, and let’s start crafting something.” So we actually put a project brief together, we, we acted like we were the clients and we needed to have parameters, so it wasn’t the wild west and just running all over the place. We needed to have parameters, and we designed things, we mocked them up, we shot them for our portfolio, we put them out there. We put it out on Dribble, we put it out on our website, and then people started calling because they liked something–a beverage project, and then they had a beverage project themselves. And so we started getting clients based on the work that we were putting out there. So we weren’t waiting for clients to come to us, we were like, “Okay, we need to put something out there, you know, put a little bait in the water for them to bite and so we could bring them in. We have to craft something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Uh, a good example is, uhh, we…we, I! I had an opportunity for a restaurant branding project. Honestly, I don’t remember how the guy found us, he was gonna do a pizza shop, and that was extremely exciting. It would have been our first restaurant project. He came in–and this is when we first opened our office in Pasadena, we didn’t have a lot of furniture, we didn’t have anything on the walls, it was like, I was like: “Oh my God! I, we have to look professional!” So we were actually printing stuff out and putting them on the wall like we were like super busy. He came into the office and, and we would pretend like we were really busy and we did the dog-and-pony show, and he, I thought for sure we got the project. And he didn’t call us back. And I was like, that was our opportunity to get into the restaurant business. But because we didn’t get that project, I’m like, “Okay, guys. We need to create that hypothetical restaurant project.” And we took that as an opportunity, and we put that on the Internet, and then we started getting calls to do restaurant projects. But I think that only works if you do good work. It can’t be mediocre work. Otherwise, you’re going to probably get mediocre clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I don’t think anybody wants medio–mediocre work, period. Even mediocre clients don’t want mediocre work. Let me, let me ask you a couple of questions. So you’re fussing about doing this artwork, trying to create the appearance and the facade that you’re a happening studio, and then you don’t get the work. Any other reasons why you don’t think you got the work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@52:55&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think there wasn’t a certain polish. I still was sort of refining sort of our, our game in terms of, “How do we sell our skills?” Look, “Who are we?” We were still trying to define who we were, um, so I think they didn’t have necessarily confidence in our ability. We probably didn’t have that body of work yet, um, to sort of lean against, um, so I think there was, there was two-fold. Um, did they have the, the trust in our ability to put–to do something? And, do you have something to support that, that I can see? They like case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah. I’m gonna mention a couple of things, ‘cause, I want to fill in some of the gaps for our audience. I remember talking to you about this and, and, and I think I’m glad that you’ve ultimately had made those changes, but I remember looking at your portfolio. So now you, you have your foot half into this other world (we’ll just call it the “adult world”), and half of the other foot in the youthful action-sports-lifestyle brand world. And I think even at this point (‘cause you and I, we’ve had so many conversations, especially when you still lived in Santa Monica), we’d go out to lunch, first it would be once a week, and then twice a week, and it seemed like we’re having lunch every single day. And I was just meeting up with you, we would chat, basically, just trying to help a friend level-up his business game, which is something I felt really good about. But I remember seeing like really beautiful, mature typography and work for real estate clients, and some beautiful identity design work that was in conflict with this other (if you guys remember back to surf brands, those kind of stuff he was doing), it was diametrically opposed in look and tone. So I, I don’t know if I articulated that clearly to you at that point in time. You do need to make a choice. Because it’s, it’s kind of schizophrenic. People show up at your site, they’re gonna see something or they’re gonna ask themselves: “Which designer am I getting? Am I getting the more sophisticated, mature person who can understand big businesses? Or do I want that youthful, edgy energy?” And I think at that point you weren’t quite ready to let that go, but ultimately you did, and you started to change portfolios. So, a recurring theme here–that I’m gonna try to do my best to articulate is your ability to look in the moment, and make some really hard decisions that seem to go against every fiber of your being. We trace it back to “I just want to do the work,” “I have great pride and ownership,” “I think it’s good–and it’s ethical for me to do the work,” and then to let that go, to let that go and it transformed you. Then to take on more employees and then to make a big commitment. Anybody that’s been out there who has had to sign a lease, it’s like a 3-year lease, you’re making a commitment–a promise to pay somebody else rent that you’re not sure if you’re going to be able to do for the next 3 years. That is a big “gut-check” moment. And you’re doing all these things (you call them “small, scaffolding steps”), but really, they’re giant commitments internally that you have to get over. And to also let go of some of the past to make room for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And you did all that and I, I–kudos to you. It took you awhile (I, I always say, like, you would be ten times big and successful if you just moved a little faster), but you’re, you’re super successful now, and I want to show a little bit more of your work. But, there’s another thing that I want to talk about here and you’ve mentioned it a couple of times so I feel that I need to point it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@56:00&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: When Hugh Barton was on here, the psychotherapist, he talked about the difference between “self-confidence” and “self-esteem.” I’ve never heard this before explained this way (and I hope I don’t butcher this prat): “self-confidence” is how you feel about you and your work when nobody is around; “self-esteem” is how you feel when other people are around. And I think they’re one and the same because you truly cannot be self-confident if you don’t have the self-esteem. Well, why is that? Because you had mentioned twice now that you brought in this superstar designer, and you weren’t sure if she would want to work with you because you’re working out of your garage. So I’ve never suffered from that because I always thought, “I have a lot to share, and the work is going to be really good.” Don’t worry about the Ikea tables and the cardboard box that we work out of. And then that, that popped up again when you had clients come in, and you’re like: “Oh! Let’s make sure we look a certain way!” When I wanted to spend all my energy working on the internal, working on the mindset, the self-esteem, the self-confidence, so I could learn how to talk to people. ‘Cause in theory then, when all that stuff goes away, when it, when it gets torched or something happens, you still have the stuff inside, and that’s the important stuff. But, the last thing that you mentioned, which is (a thing that we referred to as “closing the gap”), a lot of creative people, they know their fullest potential and they keep saying to themselves: “If a client ever gave me the opportunity, I would do this amazing work!” What they’re doing is they’re putting the burden of work and the leap of faith and the risk in the client’s hands. You said to yourself, very wisely: “We want to do this kind of work. Realistically, looking at our own work, we’re not going to get this kind of work based on our portfolio. So we need to make the time and energy and, and put the resources together to, to put this kind of work out.” And it, and you for, for doing what you did, almost–it felt instant results. You put out the projects, it got talked about, it got shared on all these sites and these blogs, and then all this attention was now turned onto you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And it was wonderful, so you were rewarded for making your efforts about showing the people, the world, the potential that you believed in yourself, but hadn’t shown before. And that’s how you go about and get this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@58:05&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So you guys out there that are scratching your head and thinking about this right now, how do I make that transition from being a “poor, broke person” (but not broken person, just a broke person), and, how do I make that transition? How do I get out of that? So close the gap. You have to do good work. All of the conversation we’re having right now, you guys, means that you have to know your craft. That’s the beginning part, but that’s not the end. That’s just the beginning. Okay. Any other questions? And I’mma show more of your work and we’re gonna kind of figure out like life lessons, things that you can peel away from this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Any other kind of questions, you guys? People are saying this is like the “best livestream ever,” it’s like, that’s a little hyperbolic, but I’ll take that. Okay. Somebody’s putting in quotes (air quotes). Gianfranco, uhh, he’s saying “Adult-design equals money?” I don’t know. Alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: We got a couple of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You do? Okay, fire away, man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: Yeah, um, this one comes from Galley Taylor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright, speak into the mic, dude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: This one comes from Galley Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: And, she’s asking, uh, if: “When you look for a client–uh, when you look for clients, do you look for one with definite budgets for service, or do you look, do you work with clients to organically develop a budget for your service?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Do you understand the question?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yes, I do. You know I was, when you’re hungry, you’ll take any client. So when you’re developing and you’re trying to build that foundation, you’ll take pretty much any client, as long as they’re willing to pay you for your craft. So as you evolve and you become, um, more polished, uh, I think the rules change a little bit and, um, I think, fortunately for, uh, my business (Farm Design) that uh, we’ve evolved quite a bit in a really short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@59:53&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And so the rules that I look for in a, in work, uh, I call it the sort of the “3 Ps.” It’s 3 rules I wanna try to hit and I, to determine if it’s the right project for us and, and the 3 Ps are: Portfolio, profit, and people. So portfolio is, I look at it when someone calls me, is it gonna be a project that I get really excited about? A juicy project? Something that I, I want to put into my portfolio? I want to take pride in? Um, the other one is: profit. Uh, I want to assess to see if the, the client is qualified, if they have a budget, and, uh, so I dig deeper, and I, you know, you ask those questions, sometimes it’s unveiled when you, when you do a proposal. And the third one is, um: people. Um, they say like 85% of your problems come from 15% of your clients, um…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s actually 80-20, it’s the Pareto Principle, but yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:00:50&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So I fudged it a little?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So I’ve worked with a lot of–what I consider–like, “bad” clients, and, and it just, it takes the soul out of you when you work with certain people that either they don’t respect you or they don’t respect your craft, or conversely so. So I think it’s really important when you’re in a business relationship that, um, it’s a healthy relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:01:11&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So my role is: I need to have at least 2 of those working for me. You can’t just have one and I think that the, the unicorn is if you can have all 3. So, when assessing like type of work that uh we want to work for, or the type of people, um, so I don’t necessarily have to have make money every single time I take a job if the people I respect and they’re fun to work with, and it’s a portfolio piece that’s really exciting. ‘Cause I know that’s an investment that’s gonna get the next job. Um, but you can do any, any combination, but for me it’s gotta be at least 2 out of those 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah. Okay. 2 out of the 3. Any other questions? Emmanuel? Sam?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Yeah, we have a question from…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Fire away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Jaimie Montaño. Uhh, she’s asking: “How do you produce good work when you’re in a hurry because you’re super low on cash?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You got it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:01:59&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah. “How do you produce work?” I, I don’t believe in working fast. I, I think, um, as a, as a creative director guiding my design staff, I, I never say: “Work faster. Hurry up.” Because I, I think you’re just going to get inferior work. They’re just gonna like, “Uhhhhhhh.” There’s gonna–there’s that tension and they’re trying to craft something. I, I believe in being highly productive, and so, um, trying to do something in a short period of time, I think, part of it is you gotta be realistic with the project and the timelines that you take on. I, I think it would be a disservice to your client if you take on a project that you can’t meet the deadlines, and if you can’t do it at a certain uh standard and quality that, uh, that you believe in, then, you, you, you simply shouldn’t take it. You have to be able to walk away from a project because ultimately you’re going to tarnish that relationship and they’re not gonna come back. Um, I buh–I believe in building relationships so that client continues to come back. I, I’m personally not a salesperson, so I, I don’t do traditional-like sales, cold calls. I don’t do a lot of outbound sort of marketing ‘cause it’s just not my style, so, when I have an opportunity to work with a client, I wanna make sure I, I put my best foot forward because I want to be able to continue that working relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:03:19&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Do you guys have a follow-up question for him? I’m trying to monitor Facebook and, and YouTube as well. Wel, why don’t we do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: I…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, go ahead, Erica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Um, so, do you have any projects that you regret doing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Any projects that…?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You regret doing? Any projects that you regret doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:03:38&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Oh, wow. That’s a great question. Absolutely. I’m trying to–haha–I, I think, oftentimes, the projects that I regret are because I didn’t align or have the same values or principles as my client. Um, so I think it’s not necessarily uh if I made money or didn’t make money, if, or, um, if it’s uh, a portfolio piece or not, I think the projects that I regret most are aligning with someone that they didn’t respect our craft or I didn’t respect their vision, and so, I try to avoid those relationships. But! Sometimes you don’t know until you get into that relationship, so, it’s, it’s, it’s challenging and, and sometimes you have to be willing to accept the fact that it may not be a good relationship and like, and just, say, “You know, I just don’t think it’s a good fit. And I think, uh, I wish you the best of luck,” and you just part ways. But, um, “projects that you regret,” it’s…I think, I will continue to encounter those, and–but I’m always trying to like do my, uh, best due diligence to sort of curb the, that. But it’s, it’s challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Uh, I have a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Um, so how do you deal with those projects where you realize that “Maybe we shouldn’t have taken this?” But you did and then you have to follow through with it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:05:08&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I seldom, I, I don’t like to leave people in a lurch. I think there’s something about my personality, so, I, I, I don’t typically will walk away from a challenging situation. Um, I, I think if it’s the, the client, and it’s a tumultuous relationship where there’s tension and we’re not seeing eye to eye, then I’m just gonna have that conversation with them that, you know, I think maybe there’s someone better for you. And then we sort of figure out some sort of exit strategy. I think otherwise if we continue down this uh, this tumultuous relationship then I don’t think we’re gonna be able to produce our best work, the experience is gonna be tarnished and at the end, ultimately, neither party is gonna be happy, so, why go through that, that long process? I think it’s best to just be open and transparent, and just say, “I, I think we’re not the best fit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. I, I wrote down some things here. Let’s see here. There was a question from YouTube that asked: “Is that fake restaurant project still available on your site somewhere? And what’s it called?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It’s not on our website anymore, but it lives on the Internet because one of the great things is…the, there’s a, an influential blog called “The Dieline”…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, there’s a, other blogs out there, and when we put projects out there, and with technology and social media, um, people pick it up if it’s noteworthy and they share that information. So, the projects still live out there, I think the one I was referring to is called “Old Boy Blues?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm. I’m gonna find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: “Old Boy Blues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And, the designer that worked on that, she was actually an intern at my company. She is now my art director and she’s been with me for 5 years. So, this project was, you know, it was kind of a labor of love and we, we were like trying to feel it out. And it was all mock-ups. It was hypo–purely hypothetical, but that got us our first restaurant project and today, we, we do a ton of restaurant work and I think on any given day, we’re probably working on 2 or 3 restaurant projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I am not finding your project here. But I will trying finding–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: “Old Boy…Blues?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uhh, I’ll try, but let me do “Farm Design” and see what I come up with. You can keep talking to me while I find this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, I think, um, talking about how, um, technology can help drive marketing for yourself, is even the Mugo project that we were referring to earlier is, it got picked up by The Dieline. I didn’t expect this. Um, they picked it up because I had posted something on my website, uh, The Dieline picked it up and posted it, and then I started getting all these calls, and one of the calls I got was from Dreamworks. Uh, Dreamworks contacted me and they said they wanted to do uh, a licensing partnership deal with me on, on Mugo. And this is all because I put something out there. I tried to create an opportunity, I didn’t know where it was gonna take me, but I knew that I needed to put something out there and create my own opportunities, and then I was able to get Mugo into Walmarts and Urban Outfitters and, and retail, but I, I learned a lot from that. I’m no longer doing Mugo, but I think that opportunity taught me a lot of lessons about the business side of design and it took a lot, um, less off the creative side, so when I’m going into meetings with clients, I can talk about the business side, which I learned through Mugo. Like, what is your go-to market strategy? How, you know, what is your, um, what are your costs? Um, what is your distribution channels? You know, you ask these questions and I never would have been informed and knew how to ask, because I was a designer, I was more talking about the right font and the colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:09:04&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: But I think if you talk uh business on a strategic level and you bring value to um, the relationship, then that’s when, uh, they’re more intrigued and uh, see you as a valued partner as opposed to just as a designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And that’s when my business really started to grow, is when I changed the dialogue from “design” to “business strategy.” And I think that’s a big part of why my business sort of took another step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, I’m gonna make a note to follow up on this, but I found “Ol’ Boy Blues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s right here on the screen. It’s ‘cause I was typing “old,” I didn’t know it was “Ol’ Boy Blues.” So this is what it looks like. I remember you working on this. And this reminded me to kind of ask you this question about mock-ups and things like that, because some people in our pro-group, I, I told them you’re gonna be on the show and they said, “Ask him about how he does such a great job with his mock-ups and Behance.” Are there any tips that you can share with us? How much labor is put into these photographs that we are seeing here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:10:00&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Well, we’re not photographers so we just, we just do the best we can. We just try to figure it out, and I think that’s the, that’s the whole key to these things. It’s just, you figure it out. Just, just go into it, not necess–you don’t have to know the outcome. You just have to be willing to take that first step. Um, so this, we, we–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Now take for example this image here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Is this a stock photo that you comp’d the thing onto the brick wall?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No, we actually, there was, this is one of the alleyways behind, uh, one of our office, our office in Pasadena, and we, we shot this, with the, with the SLR camera and then we actually photoshopped uh the graphics onto the brick wall there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Who’s the guy wearing the vest carrying the crate and the bicycle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: He was an employee at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh! Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And uh, so yeah. He modeled for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. And he had a vest and an old straw hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That’s his style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. What restaurant are we photographing this in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, so we’re like: We need to get that contextual shot, and so we actually went into uh, uh, a burger place, and we said, uh, “We’re doing a student project. Would you mind if we shot some photos?” And they said, “No problem.” So we ordered some food and we took some snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, I remember at this time, you barely even knew how to use the camera, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I was terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I remember ‘cause you were asking me questions–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I still don’t know how to use the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, well that’s fine. But you knew enough now on how to take a shot that’s kind of lit well and kind of understand lighting. And it’s a key part to you being able to do such great mock-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, for us it’s a lot about storytelling, so it’s like we wanted to tell the story, the brand story, contextualize it and, and so that was, that was circa–there might be a date on there–circa 2012, maybe? 13?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Something like that. That’s okay. And then I want to look at your portfolio now on Farm, Farm Design on Behance. You get a lot of leads on, from Behance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: We get a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You get a lot. And so I want to talk about this for a brief moment ‘cause I’ve been harping on this to our audience. And they’re like: “Chris, I can’t get any work!” And I said, “Are you on Behance? What does it look like? And how much effort and energy did you put into those things?” So, I’m gonna step onto this one since it’s the newest one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: This “Ciderworks” thing here. Let’s take a look at it. Go ahead and talk us through this thing. What are you doing here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: This is a project that we just launched yesterday. It’s called “Bivouac.” It’s a cider company in San Diego, California, they came to us maybe a year and a half ago because they saw some logos that we put on Behance that also was just a hypothetical project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Which one was that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That was, um, uh “Rust Coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Rust Coffee, okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You guys look–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So we, we put…you know, so they found us on Behance, uh, they contacted us and we started–uh, they do cider. They wanted to do canned cider. They wanted to have a restaurant, um, sort of a, uh, uh, a watering hole for their clients or consumers, and, this is a year and a half process. And so when we put this together, it’s, it’s a combination of uh, telling a story, telling a brand story and hitting a lot of sort of the different facets of the brand, um, we try to look at sort of micro and macro sort of stories. A lot of what you see here are (those cans and boxes), those are mock-ups. So, whether we do a uh 3-D model, um or we use stock photography sites–uh, those I think we got from um, yellowimages.com, they do all these really great, sort of mock-ups with lighting, and so um we buy those off of there. And a lot of these other ones, like, when we look at stock photography, like you here, you have here with the guy holding the, the beer bottle, his…finding the right stock photography that doesn’t look like stock photography, that also aligns with the vision of the brand, so, it’s not just like pulling a photo and dropping it in there. It’s like you have to really curate and think about how that story works. Is it the right demographic? Does it have the right lighting and the tonality? Um, that one there, we loved to use stocksy.com is a really great sort of stock photo site. They don’t feel stock. We also use Shutterstock, um, dot com, but Shutterstock typically is, is good for, um, more sort of pedestrian-looking images. They do look kind of stock. But it’s a combination of mocking things up, shooting things, shooting them in-studio, um, shooting them out-of-studio…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well here’s what I wanna do: I want to break this thing down. And I’m gonna prep you for this in case you don’t want to do it. But, I’m gonna ask you a little bit about the business part of this thing, but not just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Let’s talk about these cans. Is this CG? Computer generated? Or is this photographed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Can you tell me? What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I think it’s CG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: How can you tell?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: ‘Cause I know you don’t know how to photograph cans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay. You are correct. It is, it is a mock-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Hold on! I’m sorry for that!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It is a mock-up. But, I think–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think some of the best, um, interpretations of branding are mock-ups. I don’t think it has to be a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: No apologies. No apologies, dude. I don’t care. I think it looks great! I, I’m only guessing because I-you said, “I still don’t know how to take photos.” And to take a can sweating like this, it’s not that easy to do, and I look at the gradations a lot. You used that yellow? What, what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yellow Images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yellow Images for this. How much did it cost you to buy the model for this and put uh, put your label on it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: A dollar fifty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Two hundred and fifty dollars, okay. A dollar fifty, you guys!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: A dollar fifty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: A dollar fifty. So that’s like–thanks for sharing this. Now, I, I just want to take a moment and say this to you guys that are out there: Aaron could have hoarded these resources. He could have said, “You guys just figure it out.” Because if you guys go look for 3-D mock-ups, you might spend quite a bit of time, trial and error, in finding the right vendors. So I really appreciate you saying that, and I’ve not heard of “Stocksy” before, and we’ll talk a little bit more about that. So he’s sharing his resources–he’s basically saying: “You guys, go out there and make better comps.” And, and I’m not, I’m not gonna feel the competition from you right now.” Let’s keep going on here. Why did you put this kind of “mountain-scape” behind it? Tell me about the thinking behind that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:15:55&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Sure. Well, Farm Design is a branding agency, so, we are trying to attract clients and build brand systems for them. So it’s not just a logo, it’s not just a website. We like to build systems. In order to build a, uh, a brand system that is effective and can connect and communicate with their audience, you have to have many different facets to it. And so, there’s a lot of sort of tertiary, um, secondary and tertiary sort of, um, artifacts (is what we like to call them), so, a primary artifact can be a logo. And if you scroll down a little bit farther, you know, you also have secondary marks, colors, textures…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Hold on. Lemme, let me drive this a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Tell me about the mountain though. So are you, where does this label go? Is this for an ad? Or you just added this for you, for the presentation of it? Did they actually use this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: They did. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That one was actually born from one of the moodboards we created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And we actually used that uh, “texture,” if you will–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, uh, sort of kind of a misty, uh, ethereal background, um, to capture the essence of this adventure and outdoor lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C] Yeah, it’s just a cold mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I want my beverages to be cold, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, this restaurant photo: Is this their actual place? Their business?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: This is their actual place. It just literally opened up 2 days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I see. So this is fresh off the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Where is this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So you drove down to San Diego and you took this photo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was given to us and we’re actually going to go there and shoot it with, uh, consu–our, uh, consumers in the space, ‘cause I think it brings a different dynamic. So even though we posted it now, we’re going to constantly update this to sort of enhance and improve it so we want to reshoot these and, and bring a different energy to it with having people in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:17:41&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Why is it important for you to constantly improve and revisit these presentations you have on Behance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Because I know that there are clients out there that are constantly looking at us. Not only today, you know, next month, a year from now, so, why not? We have the opportunity. This is, this is dynamic information. It’s not static. It’s like, once you put it up there, it doesn’t have to–it’s not permanent. It’s not like we’re printing something, an you have to burn it and reprint it. It’s, it’s so easy just to repopulate it and, on this forum, and because clients down the road, they’re gonna see it, and they’re gonna want. And they’re gonna see those details and the nuances, so we’re always trying to improve our craft…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Constantly improving our craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:18:21&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright, I want to say this to you guys. There’s this concept from Jim Rohn’s book, “The 7 Strategies for Wealth and Happiness.” He talks about the minors and the majors, what you don’t want to do is mix up these 2 things. You don’t want to make a minor effort for a major result or a goal. And you also don’t want to make a major effort for a minor goal. When you’re talking about your lead-gen source, basically all your sales and marketing, in terms of inbound, is coming from Behance, so it behooves you to do the very best job, and I’ve seen him do this and assign teams to do this, they could spend days, if not weeks working on the layout, the typography, the color palette, the phrasing, the order, and revisit with photography, and that’s why your work stands out. There are a hundred thousand, maybe a couple million people on Behance. Well, why is it always that the best work rises to the top? It’s because they put the time and energy into it and you need to do the same. I, I want to go back and it’s getting close to us breaking for the show here, and I’m sure our livestream audience probably doesn’t want it to end, but it’s gonna end at some point, so I want to dissect this really quickly, just give me shorter answers as what slide you want to talk about. This is a deep-dive into his portfolio, his sales and marketing technique because of the work that we’re seeing here. “Embrace your adventure.” Did you guys write that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yes, we did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And so there’s a little typographic–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Brand voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And they can use that. I saw it on the can. And again, there’s another photo here. I’m assuming that’s stock photo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And then, this is another 3-D mock-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693827b0dbce3f_AaronAtchison_work2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yes, again, Yellow Images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm. Really good. Look–look at that corrugated cardboard there! You guys, that’s lookin’ really slick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, I say, ‘cause when I look at portfolios and I can tell that it’s a mock-up, that, I–I say it’s revealing the man behind the curtain. I want to try to craft something that you can’t quite tell, like, “Hmm, is that real or not?” That’s the level of detail that we’re trying to get, so like how the light hits it, how the shadows reflect, all those little nuances, if you can make it where you don’t reveal the man behind the curtain, then I think, then it’s okay. Then we’re gonna post it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Are they giving you the 3-D model? Or you give them the artwork and they render it for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It, it’s actually really great because if you subscribe to a premium version on YellowImages.com, you can actually have them do a 3-D render for you. You just give them the drawings, and I think in 2 to 4 weeks, then they’ll give you something. But then they’ll use that as, uh, they’ll sell that on–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: The stock model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: As a stock model on there, ‘cause they’re just trying to build content as well, so for a small fee of 300 dollars a year…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: They’ll actually make custom renders for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: What’s the limitation and how many can you get done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I believe it’s just one angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh, I mean in a year. Uh, you pay 300 dollars in a year–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Wow!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: If you were to hire a CG guy to do it–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: The’re gonna charge more than 300. This, I think–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: For sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think they’re in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well, whatever. Okay, so if you guys should be in a 3-D, mock-up rendering business, you are now just out of business. Okay, let’s keep going here. “Ride the winds of change.” Something you wrote…the feather…the same misty mountains…these coasters. Are these mock-ups?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It is a mock-up, and you can tell, like, we even put like a, like a, uh, water stain on the actual coaster, uh shadows and we, so we composited all that together with the background, um…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Photo-comping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, the whole thing is, like, is a composite. And this entire project here, I would say we probably invested around 100 hours to sort of mock this up. ‘Cause this is maybe 2 people working on it for over a week?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That’s, that’s how important it is to us, because I know the investment of that time and effort–I have to pay these, my employees to do this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, I understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So it’s an investment, and we know that this is gonna beget the next project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right. And I’m gonna say something that is both a complement and an insult to you. You ready? I tell my team: “Guys, look at these mock-ups. This is the gold standard,” to my team. And, “We can do better than this because we’re better than them, aren’t we? Are you telling me we’re not as good as them?” So I, I kinda just throw it out there. So if you guys (my team) can’t make better mock-ups and layouts than this, you’re not worth that much to me. I don’t say it quite like that, but, you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:22:22&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Where is the insult?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: The insult’s: We’re better than this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think anyone can be better than this, and, and I know that–and, and with that–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:22:31&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It’s like, we’re all, we also know that we can be–get better at this game as well, and so, a year from now, we expect our portfolio and our mock-ups to be better…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: …than it is today. So, you never just settle on your laurels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I, I do want to say this: Your mock-up game is tight. So, you’re, you’re already at that kind of upper echelon. Are these your shoes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That is me, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I can recognize your foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Wait, that was also a composite because the, the…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: …photo wasn’t great, and so we composited things together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: A lot of color-correction, shadows, reflections, uhhh beer stains. All that–err–water stains. So this is, so you guys know when, when they say that they’re a branding agency, they truly are ‘cause they’re writing copy, they, they’re working on a lot more touch points than just the mark itself or just one package. They’re trying to create the entire kind of visual reflection of what this brand is all about. Okay, so I think you did a great job there of explaining all that stuff, of course, this is the sort of stuff we see in a lot of sites, and you like to do these multiple logos (that you call them “brand artifacts”), I think that’s, that’s the thing that you like to, to do for your clients. This is a stock photo, I’m pretty sure of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:23:32&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: This guy’s throwing hops, or whatever he’s doing right here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:23:34&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Great. Good job, man! And I, I do want to say this to both designers and clients who are potentially watching this episode, is that: There are a lot of really great images out there. Maybe too many. And the problem is the ability to hone and find just the right image. So the image might not cost you very much in terms of payment, like, to buy an image off Shutterstock or Stocksy, it’s, it’s really pennies compared to what it would cost to commission somebody. What you are paying for is somebody with an eye who can curate this stuff and scan hundreds of–if not thousands–of images to find the one right fit for you. And that is a skill, and that is worth paying for. ‘Cause they’ve taken an asset that is a dollar and they’ve made it a hundred-thousand dollar image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Because they’ve selected the right one, they might have gone and color-corrected it and adjusted some things so it becomes something that–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Absolutely. Those details, the curation is so important. And, it’s like, you can tell pretty quickly if that’s a stock photographer–photograph, or a mock-up. We try to, sort of, increase that perception of what that is and be able to tell a story. So your focusing on the story. And I think if you do it really well, I think that’s, that’s what we’re trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:24:44&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. I want to talk a little bit about business now. Could we talk some business?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. How much did you get paid for that project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: The Bivouac?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That was an interesting one because it was, uh, I actually got stock options in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Woohoo! Excuse me! It’s the dinger on that! There we go. Alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Oh my God. Did you really…?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Nah, um. So I’m actually, uh, part owner, but very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Very, very small. But if this thing gets sold to Budweiser, you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You’ll, you’ll, you’ll combine that with–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, but in lieu of, uh, in terms of cash, it was, um, I think it was 45 thousand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Whoof!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: 45 thousand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Good for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So it was in 3 payments, uh, spread out over a year and a half but, um, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Excellent. And when you told the client–we’ll talk about some of the mindset stuff here–here, let me put this down, uhh, 45 thousand dollars, we always have these kind of fears, like, “Uhh, is it too much? Is it too little?” Tell me about your mindset when you’re like working on the estimate for this thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:25:49&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay, so, the, the individual who contacted us actually was already engaged with, with another agency down in San Diego, an agency that (when I was in school, over 20 years ago), I looked up to. I would buy books because their logos were in it, and–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I know who you’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: They were, they were, they’re amazing. They’re still amazing. And when I heard that he’s working with them, I’m like: “Okay, we’re kind of not in your league, or the league that you’re looking for.” But he said, “I saw the ‘Rust’ project,” (and you can–) it’s on our Behance page it’s–and that was a hypothetical project. He said, “I just love what you guys do, there’s something about that.” And so, he wanted us to put a proposal together. I, I knew the agency that he was already engaged with, but that he was having, um, concerns with. And, so I, I took a risk, like, I’m gonna go bid higher out of my comfort zone because you’re always pushing us and, and on the ph–when we chat, we have our tea time and you’re always saying: “Ask for more! Why are you ask–you can, you can ask! Like okay, this is this one time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: This is this one time I think I’m gonna listen to Chris again. I’m gonna try to go out of my comfort zone, because probably my comfort zone is…far less. And so I put that proposal together, and my number (I said it was 45) I found out that the other agency, I think, was 120 thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So I was woefu–I was like woefully less than them, but I was con–incredibly content with what I got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:27:25&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: But could I, could I have asked for more? But, it’s like, you know, you’re always sort of trying to figure out what your comfort level is, and what your value you bring to the project, and you, you’re always assessing if the client can afford you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right. I, I want to talk about this for a brief minute. ‘Cause there are not many people who are on this show, who know me as well as you do. We’ve had thousands of hours of talking–sometimes personal, sometimes business–uh, in the last 20 years that we’ve known each other. I just want to give you guys an opportunity here, for you to totally mock me right now. When I’m talking to you and I’m like, “Aaron, blah blah blah.” You can par–you can, you can do your parody of what you think you hear when I say these things. I would love to hear you say that, for our audience, for our fans, I think they’re gonna like it. What do you hear? Like when I’m barking these things at you, what do you hear? How does this sound like in your brain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@1:28:16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I mean…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You ready?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Oh my gosh…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You–do your close-up! Right there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Oh my gosh!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Tell the people how it sounds in your brain. I’ll get out of your shot, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:28:23&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Well, I mean, when we first started, we were kind of like enemies because we were like–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: We’re not enemies!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No, we were! We started out as enemies! Like, I just wanted to crush you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I never saw it like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And then&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It was easy to crush you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: You know, I always admired what you’ve been able to accomplish and build before even before you started The Futur, and it, it was really impressive, but I think a lot of my pride and stubbornness is like, I, I don’t want to listen to someone who is “up here.” I, I probably would listen to my parents, but I didn’t want to listen to you. And so it, for you it was just like, I, I can figure it out. I’m gonna do it my own way. And, I had to sort of realize that you’re giving me like really sound advice. So, it’s hard for me to, to parody you, but I just…I had to break down walls and sort of let you (like I, I, you’re younger than me, but I consider you like my “wise uncle”). I don’t know if that’s an insult, but no! You, you provide so much knowledge, whether it’s right or not, it’s like I, I, I start to filter it, and I start to slowly let it creep in. So it’s a–it’s been a slow burn, but I, I think I’m, I’m more open to, uh, listening to you because I think you provide, like, great content for your, your audience and I think, I think they see incredible value. So I, as, as much as you want me to mock you, I’m gonna thank you. Can I, can I just pivot? Can I just–can we do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You can do whatever you want, man. I was trying to give you your opportunity to blast it out of the universe!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No, I, I’m–that’s not, that’s not my personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: How are you not gonna mock me because other people have and they’ve done a fantastic job, so here’s what I heard (uhh, Aaron used these words): “Enemy, creep, and burn.” So, you can put those things together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah. It’s all good. It’s all good. We have a great relationship, you guys. Okay, umm, Erica, Emmanuel, and Sam: Do you guys have any last thoughts before I close out on the deck, you guys?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Emmanuel]: Umm, I have a question from Aina San: “Umm, what do you do when you’re professional opinion or own project differs from what client wants? And he can’t be convinced?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Did you hear what he said?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Nah, I didn’t hear…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Basically, what do you do when your clients start to take aw–the project away from what it’s supposed to be? How do you respond to that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:30:37&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: God, that’s a great question. We’re, we’re challenged with this all the time. All the time. Uh, I think at the end of the day, ultimately they are the client, and they hired you to provide them a service. The best that we can do is we can, we can shepherd the process the best we can. We also know that we probably know more than them on a branding standpoint. So the best we can do is we can say, “Our professional advice is that, we would urge you to do this.” Ulti–ultimately at the end of the day, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do. And that’s the way it, it’s gonna be. Um, so you’ve got to pick your battles, um, but you try to do what is best for the client, and, but at some point you gotta, you gotta just let them do what they’re gonna do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, I hope that answered the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It, it’s your answer. That’s good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright, guys. I want to thank you for coming on the show. Aaron, before we say goodbye, I want to look at some of your work and talk a little bit about your journey, and I’m gonna send this out. Alright? With some music, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Can, can I say–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You can say whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A] That when we talk about my journey, it’s like I, I wanna give a shout out to the people that aren’t here in the studio, and that’s all my employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Past and present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: ‘Cause yeah. Because they help shape who I am and they help shape the business, and so this output is a collective, uh, a collective group of really talented and young individuals. Um, so I just don’t, I want to make sure everyone knows that this is not me, this is a collection of like I think really like-minded, um, individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well, I can’t leave you there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I, I can’t. When you say, “This is not me,” I, I see a man transformed from the guy who’s like, “I, I can’t even hire an intern to cut things for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: From 10 years ago whenever that was in 2000-ish. Somewhere in 2005, to now, 13 years later. What has happened to that man? What happened to Peter Pan?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:32:37&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: You know, I realized that in order to grow, that you have to accept that you don’t know everything. And so, I, I, I think I was very humbled when I sort of hit rock bottom, um, and I sort of reassessed who I am and who I wanted to be, so for me, I want to do things that are greater than myself, and do things that are fulfilling, and I think one of the greatest things that, um, I’ve learned and that is fulfilling to me, is helping others become better people as well, so, I–for me, it’s no longer working. The work doesn’t–it’s not, I’m not doing it for myself, I’m doing it to support and nurture my staff, and my clients, and I think that is the biggest reward. It’s not a monetary thing, um, it’s not re–awards on the wall, it’s really like, seeing individuals that I work with, and clients that I work with, succeeding in life, and, there’s a couple of designers and my, my staff, they actually are taking things that they learn from me, and then they are mentoring students now, so they are volunteering their time on weekends, and they created their own program, and they’re sharing information that they learned from me, so there’s–that is, that is pretty powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:33:51&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So I just wanna like keep empowering people to empower people and, and to be in that situation–I wasn’t in that situation when I was a solopreneur. I was just focusing on me. Now I’m focusing on something beyond me, so when I say this isn’t just me, I, I’m trying to lead a team, and I just, you know, they’re the ones that are sort of helping with the vision, and sort of guiding this path that we’re all going down. It’s not–I’m, I’m just trying to like, pave the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm, mm. Okay, so here’s what I’m hearing from you. Is that when you’re working by yourself as a solopreneur, it becomes, kind of like this echo-chamber and (I hate to say it like this, but) it was very ego-centric&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And it was about all “me, me, me, me.” It’s like, “Marsha, Marsha, Marsha,” and that’s what it became. And what I’m hearing from you now is that (if, if I read this correctly), it’s that now you take great pride, not in the work that you do, but in terms of how you’re transforming other people’s lives, so when your team grows, and they do great work, you can take pride in that that you were able to create space or guidance or mentorship, or just helping them define the right clients, to get to that place. And then you also couple it off with, “It wasn’t about I wanted to do from a design point of view (which is self-centered and selfish), it was about trying to help your clients also have that same kind of success. So you can’t have a successful business without being a different kind of person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Everybody wants to be successful, so few people are willing to do the work that’s needed to change, and, and to me, that’s what you’ve been able to do. You’ve taken everything that I think is uh, an accumulation of your experiences and biases, and you’ve gone against that. You’ve let go of so many things. And that’s what has been, I think, the key to your transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Uh, uh, I think that’s pretty accurate. I think it’s, it’s getting out of your comfort zone and challenging yourself, and I think that’s when you grow as an individual. And then, learning from that and you challenge people around you to help them grow, so, getting out of that comfort zone, I think is a big part of growth. In order to get out of your comfort zone, you have to be able to accept the fact that you don’t know everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. So let’s look at a couple, few, last slides and we’re gonna close up the show, or close out the show. Here’s some more things. Of course, you guys can go to Behance and look up Farm Design. There’s a couple of Farm designs there, but you’ll recognize the work and then you can look the rest of his portfolio, and I believe Aaron is relaunching the site on Thursday-ish, so if you go to FarmDesign.net–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: –You’ll be able to see the freshly minted site. And this is really wonderful, beautiful work. It’s got really great attention to detail, patterns and textures and color palettes, and I, I truly appreciate and love all the contextual applications that you provide. So seeing it in context makes it feel so real and so rich. I don’t mean in terms of price, but it’s just a feast for the eyes and I think that’s what you guys want to do. And you see this diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:36:44&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Now, I look at this little boy, who loved basketball and you’re, you’re an athletic dude, and I see like what you’ve become, as the boy from, from Montana, to the, to the man who’s like running in Spartan races and you’re pretty hardcore. And, and you’re super competitive. So competitive I, I’m like, you just, you leave me in the dust. You keep doing these things. Okay, I’m just trying to limp across the finish line myself. And, you, you were a guy who was afraid of commitment, afraid of being out in the public, to speaking at TED (a HUGE accomplishment there), kudos to you, and, making the ultimate commitment, and getting married. And before anybody starts to cry, we’re gonna end the show on that. Okay? You guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: End it quickly!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C] Yeah. Okay, so I’m gonna–Ey! Let’s cut back to me! Aaron, thanks for coming on the show, dude! I know this is a big moment for both of us because there was a lot of fear, questions, concerns, and all that kind of stuff about what’s it entail, and I’m so appreciative that you’ve been so transparent and sharing of all the highs and the lows. I was a little shocked that you were able to talk about the money. I wasn’t sure if you’d go there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Me, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And, you just let it go, baby! It’s all out there! So guys, um, we don’t, I don’t have, um, an applause track, but thank you very much. I’m gonna close out this show. Let’s cut this thing. Let’s, let’s do…let’s try this music. This sounds appropriate, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

We are live today on Facebook and Youtube! Hello, beautiful people! What are we going to be talking about today? Well, before I tell you, I just want to let you guys know I miss ya and I hope you missed us, and here we are back on the livestream. But! Back by popular demand, today we are going to be talking to Aaron Atchinson, he’s the founder of Farm Design based in Pasadena, and he is one of–he’s a man who has come from humble roots. Humble beginnings, and that’s his description, not mine. Now often times when we look at successful graphic designers and successful businesses, we make the assumption that it was preordained. That everything lined up for them and that that path was inevitable. This was most definitely not the case, so you guys are gonna want to definitely stay tuned to this because we’re gonna have a conversation with Aaron. He grew up in a town of 300 people. Small town. Stick around! Roll the titles!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[RAW Titles]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:36&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright, we’re back. Now you guys noticed I’m not in the black box. I’m sitting next to my good friend, and we are good friends. We’ve known each other for, I think somewhere close to 20 years if not longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Aaron Atchinson]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s been awhile. It’s been awhile, so, there’s a familiarity here, and I’ve been prodding and pulling and pushing and hoping and begging for Aaron to come on the show and do it live with us, and he finally agreed, so lots of things have changed in his life, but before we do that, let’s tell everybody who you are and let’s get back and rewind the tape if you will, let’s cut to my deck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@2:08&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: This is Aaron Atchison, and he is the Founder of Farm Design. And if you guys want to look him up, what’s the web address?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: FarmDesign.net&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Man, you sound good in that mic. Dang! Alright, anyways, you grew up in a small town called “Geraldine, Montana.” Tell me about Geraldine. What do you remember growing up there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Geraldine, Montana is in the central part of Montana, it’s a rural community, a farming community, a town (at that time, the population was 300–it’s actually, probably, maybe, far less than that now), but it was a lot of agriculture, um, built around community and the high school.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah. So there are–we have a picture of you, your brother, and your dad, you sitting on a boat in a lake somewhere, you shoveling something. What is, what are you shoveling there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That would be grain in a grain silo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s how much I don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: A grain silo. Do you have any horror stories about the grain silo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: In the grain silo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Normally when you hop in those things, there’s like a ton of mice running around in there and, and I don’t like mice, so, you know, so we normally let the dogs in first and the dogs sort of scare all of the mice out and then we hop in there. That’s my horror story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, so as I mentioned, you grew up in a town of 300 people, high school population of…?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: The high school, 50 kids and my graduating class had 11 kids, but we had an exchange student, so, I would say, pretty much we had 10 from the time I moved there from when I was in 5th grade ‘till the time I graduated. So it was the same (basically), the same 10 students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, so, you go to high school and then you graduate. What did you study in school at Montana State?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I always wanted to be either a baker or an architect growing up. There was something–fascination I had with baking. I like baking pancakes in the morning, but I chose to become an architect so I went to Montana State University, which is in Bozeman, Montana, um, to study architecture initially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And, how does one who studies architecture at Montana State wind up in California doing graphic design?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That’s interesting. I was actually born in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh! You were?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So my brother, who’s a year older than myself, we were both born and raised in California. Uh, my mom was really young when she had two of us. Later I found out in life that she, she was 16 years old when she had two boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Wow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So, we actually moved around quite a bit as kids ‘cause my mom was trying to figure out where her path was and trying to just survive, and trying to figure out how to raise two young boys. So we moved around a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, we ultimately ended up (um, what I consider my hometown, which is in Montana). So we bounced around a lot, and we settled there when I was about ten years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah. So, um, she met a gentleman and they got married. His name is Larry Atchison, so I took on his last name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, but yeah, I think a lot of my, sort of, experiences in life, I refer back to that time that I lived when I was in Montana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Because I think I learned a lot of, like, discipline and a lot of the qualities that I sort of, I can attribute to growing up there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@5:14&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uh-hm. It must have been tough for you growing up because you, your mom was like in her teens…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And I imagine that there wasn’t a lot of money. You’ve told me stories about you actually having to go outside to go to the bathroom in what is referred to as an “outhouse.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@5:26&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It’s still called an “outhouse.” Yes, but, we–I…one point we lived in a house where we didn’t have running water. And so, when you don’t have running water, you don’t have plumbing, and so we had an outhouse that you had to walk (I think it was maybe a hundred yards away). Which was terrible when it was snowing because then you always, like, in the middle of the night, you have to go to the bathroom. You have to go to the bathroom and then you throw on your sneakers and your hoodie and you run out through the snow but, yeah, it was–it was tough, but you know, when you’re a kid you don’t, you don’t think about those things. It’s just, it’s just the fact of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Do you have any horror stories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Horror stories?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: About going to the bathroom and there’s a raccoon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Oh gosh, no. Nothing quite like that. I always feared there was something actually in the outhouse. Like, you know, but nothing. Nothing like that. So I–fortunately no horror stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Like there wasn’t a pennywise holding a red balloon in a hole and saying, “Come here!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: No?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No. Not in the country. Yeah, clowns are smarter than that. They don’t move out in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: They only hang out in suburban neighborhoods under the city. Okay, luckily for you. What–I mean, I can’t even fathom this. Look, I grew up kind of poor, too, but just not even having running water…how do you wash your hands and what does it even, how does it even work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@6:38&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, wow. There was actually a creek, and the creek was maybe 300 yards away, and so part of growing up is my brother and I, we always had chores, and the first thing I had to do waking up in the morning was start the fire, ‘cause we didn’t have heating. We didn’t have centralized heating so, we had to like chop wood and we had to start the fire to heat the house up. So I had to wake up at (I think around) 6:30, start the fire, that was my responsibility, and then to get water, we had these um, buckets (and I think they were maybe like 3 or 4 pound buckets), and I at the time probably weighed 70 pounds soaking wet, so I was, I was tiny. And then we had to go out to the creek, then we’d have to–a little pull, and we’d pull it up, and we’d carry it back to the house so–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: A lot of hard work!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Boil water and, um, if you’ve ever seen “Hee-Haw” (which I’m kind of dating myself), like, there are scenes in there where they would bathe and they were sitting there in like a big, um, stainless steel, um, bucket, and they’re bathing themselves with a ladle. That’s how we literally bathed. And we didn’t do it all the time because it was, it took a lot of effort, so, um, we, oftentimes we bathed once a week. It was very challenging! But it was, it was just the way of life! And it was like, you didn’t know any different. It was, it was actually pretty cool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@7:55&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It sounds a little bit like now from thinking about it, it sounds like camping. So for the first part of your life, you were just camping all the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: We were, yeah. We were always camping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C] Was it fun?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was a lot of fun! You know, it was uh, ‘cause there was a creek that ran out in front of a house that we lived in and we’d go out and we would go fishing and we’d bring the fish back in and that what we’d have for dinner. And we’d cook it right then and there. Um, so, yeah. And you were outside a lot and there’s animals, and I’m an animal person, so we had horses and cows and dogs and yeah, it was just, being outside and exploring. When you’re a kid, you’re just constantly, you’re curious and you’re exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@8:31&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. Let’s get you to California. And we’re gonna speed up the timeline here a little bit because I really do want to get into some of the mindset stuff that we’re going to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@8:38&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You’re in California now, what brings you out to California?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@8:42&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: You know, okay, so, I went to Montana State University initially to study architecture. Um, I still had family here in California so, um, during the summers I would normally go and visit them and um, they would take us to like Disneyland and uh, then I was introduced to surfing, so, during the summers I would surf as much as possible. Um, but I really made the big transition when I discovered–at the time I didn’t know what it was called, but it was graphic design. Graphic design I had no idea what it was, I didn’t really know what a logo was, um, growing up in the country, they’re just, you’re not exposed to a lot of media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, so when I was at the university, there was like these, some wacky kids, uh, at a department next to the architecture department, and they were doing some wacky stuff, and they were putting stuff on the walls, and I’d walk past their, um, their uh, studio space and I’d poke my head in and one day they were painting pizza boxes and it really piqued my interest. I’m like, “What are they painting pizza boxes for?” I walked in there and they were telling me they were designing logos and boxes, so I wanted to learn more, and it sparked my interest because I liked the simplicity and how impactful a logo and packaging could be. So that sort of led me to my next career path as um, or, in school rather is, I decided I’m going to move to California, change majors, mainly so I can surf in California, and then I, uh, I went to Cal State University, Northridge, uh, where I studied art with an emphasis in graphic design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@10:17&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Now, I’m going to spare you guys all the kind of details but, you started out in, in your home studio doing design and you’ve been doing that for quite some time. Now you and I met under kind of strange circumstances. I’m gonna let the guys know out in the audience here. We met through a mutual friend, a former employee of mine who said like, “I know you love to play Halo, Chris, so come and I’m gonna bring my buddy in. “And I know you’re a super competitive guy, I won’t get into all the juicy details, but we would all bring our X-Boxes together and, and do a LAN party and play Halo together. And that’s really how I got to know you. And I remember, there’s a couple times we wanted to play, so I would just grab my X-Box and go meet you up at your house and we’d plug the things in. I–we would go into one room and we’d have these LAN parties and just do battle for lunch and unplug and just run back to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And I didn’t know you that well at the time. You were just that guy in the other room that I just wanted to kill. And so Halo is like one of those sports like–and you were probably equally as competitive. And so, I would come visit my friend and I would come to your office and you guys would actually print out sort of like…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Floorplans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Floorplans of the maps of Halo and you guys were strategizing. You had like rulers and lines, like you’d go here and here. I’m like, “This guy is intense.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Isn’t that how everybody plays Halo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No, just you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: We weren’t going to lose, so that’s really how we got our start, but as our kind of casual friendship built up around gaming and just competing, and then I started to learn more about you and your design practice, and I’m gonna get you guys to 2008 a little bit right now. Okay? So let’s look at 2008. This is the studio in which you worked out of?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, I…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Talk to us about this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@11: 56&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, just, uh, after I graduated college, um, I got a job as a creative director at a small agency in Culver City, here in Los Angeles. So I worked there for 5 years. Um, I sort of cut my teeth sort of learning the principles of design, and working with clients, and, uh, working with vendors. I, I learned a lot. It was, it was uh, a fantastic experience in my life. In 2000 I decided I was gonna, I was gonna branch out and I was gonna do my own thing and so I had a spare bedroom in my apartment, um, and so I converted that spare bedroom into my studio, if you will, and really it was just a computer on a desk. Um, I, I was, I had enough confidence in my ability and skill level and I had some relationships and I had some small clients, so I’m like: “Okay, I’m going to take that leap of faith.” I had a little bit of money in the bank account (I think, uh, at that time, I had literally 9,000 dollars in my account), so I said–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s pretty good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was pretty good! I figured that I could live without any income coming in for three months and so I kind of had a time scale, like, “Okay, if this is going to happen, I, I gotta make it happen in three months.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And how old are you at this point? Do you remember?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, I was exactly 30. It was on my 30th birthday, I’m like, “I’m leaving.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Wow. Okay. And what year is this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh, 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Well, interesting. Alright, I’m trying to map your timeline, as to kind of, well…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I took the 7-year plan in, in college if you’re doing the math. But, yeah…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@13:23&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, let’s look at some of the work. So it makes sense to hear your story about your love of surfing and outdoors and just be, you’re kind of into sports and you’re an athlete and competition, and this is kind of…&lt;br/&gt;[A] Yeah, that’s where my passion was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385c3cdbce3e_AaronAtchison_work1.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, this is a time capsule into kind of the work that you were doing. And I remember talking to you at this point in time, and, I’m going to tell a little story you guys. So here’s my, here’s my story. I’m over at Aaron’s house and he’s showing me the work that he’s doing and he’s talking about doing work with new clients, and I remember you were showing me this very ornate packaging you were putting together. I remember this, and you were going to ship this to whatever, or self-promo pieces, and I had asked you at this time, “Aaron, why don’t you get an intern in here to do this? There’s somebody else that could be doing this while you do the high-level stuff.” And I remember your response. Do you remember it, or should I tell this part?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, I didn’t listen to you much back then, so, you were my mortal enemy, so, no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: How am I your–?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Refresh my memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Hold on. How am I your mortal enemy?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I do remember you telling me I should do a lot of things to improve what I, my practice, right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Basically it was me giving you valuable advice that just hit you like a rock and fell on the floor, at that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Pretty much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@14:33&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Your response to me was: “Hey, Chris. If I don’t do this, what else am I going to be doing? And, I don’t know, I’m just a simple guy, I just want to do the work, I see something that needs to get done and I just do it. Why would I hire anybody else to do this? What else am I gonna do?” And I remember telling you, “Well, you should be working on your business and not in your business. Be thinking about how to grow and scale.” And do you remember that now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I do remember and I think a lot of those, um, the way I was brought up growing up on a farm is like you’d…work had to be done, you just rolled, rolled your sleeves up and you got out there and you did the work. And so, when I started my practice, I still had that sort of mindset where things had to be done (I knew how to do them), and so I just rolled my sleeves up and did it. You were always, you were always sort of, kind of like that uncle that always wanted to like give me advice and I, I think I was pretty stubborn back then (still a little stubborn).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I just want to say for the record: A younger uncle, please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Perhaps, perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Don’t paint me into that picture. Just a younger uncle. The younger, cooler uncle. Keep going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: But when you said, uh, back when I first started my practice and you saw me sort of doing all these little, little tasks when you said, “You need, you should outsource that, or you should get someone to help you.” Uh, for me, I was not afraid of hard work, so I kinda didn’t understand your principles. I also was always concerned that I would be giving away something…um, I always wanted to be close to my craft, and I always, I love designing and having my hands on things and working, so, for me it’s like it didn’t feel like work so it didn’t feel like I was, I needed to give away anything. I wasn’t that busy all the time anyway, and I think that to your point is, so, it’s like, “Well I have the extra time and if I didn’t have extra time, I would just stay up later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So that was always just, that was my mentality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, so some people are guessing correctly how old Aaron is. I’m not going to tell you, but you can do the math. Now, I remember also talking to you because you would work really hard, and I’m, I would never accuse you of not working hard, but maybe I would accuse you of not working as smart as you need to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And I remember then, for periods of time you would just disappear. You would disappear and go surfing in Costa Rica, and you’d go on these epic adventures, meanwhile I was toiling away kind of in the factory, if you will. I remember saying this to you one time, I was like: “Aaron, I think you suffer from ‘Peter Pan’ syndrome. Like, you never want to grow up. You’re still doing projects–” (now, we’re in our 40s at this point, I think).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No, we’re in our late thirties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Late thirties?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Careful, we were in our thirties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: We’re in our late thirties, and I was telling you, “Like, you work on projects that I think 18, 19, 22-year-old kids would love to work on.” Uh, action, sports-oriented things and brands, and I remember you working on certain events that was kind of like–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Like X-Games type of stuff. Yeah, absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And, the other part to it was not only just reflected in the clients that you were working with and the things that connected and resonated with you, but, this idea that you would work and then you would disappear. You would just plan these trips and you would just disappear, and, and, and you liked the idea that you could pick up and go wherever you wanted, kind of in this more “transitory-transient” lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And, I said to you, “One day, when you want to focus on your business, your life will change and it will change for the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And what was your thought?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think that my thought process during those, those years–I think–and it was right around from 2000 and 2008 was when I was a solo, solo designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: “Solopreneur.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@18:02&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: “Solopreneur,” sort of working out my, my, my practice out of my home. My, my philosophy at the time was: I have skill and I’m willing to work hard, and, I had a certain level of success early on. I had certain clients and I would look at the bank account and I’d see the money coming in and, and it was pretty decent. You know? It was anywhere between 50 thousand to 90 thousand–was probably one of my best years. So that’s where the range was, and for me that was really good. And so I had this philosophy: I’m gonna–as long as I’m hitting a certain number, then whatever time I have leftover, I’m gonna experience things in life. So I would travel, um, so yeah. It was very much sort of a, sort of a “fixed” mindset. I wasn’t looking at [the] “big picture,” I was sort of “living in the now,” and I would look at your career and I saw you working so hard, like, always working, and I was the antithesis of that. I’m like, “Chris, why aren’t you enjoying life? Have you ever traveled out of the country?” And you were like, “There will be a time for that.” And I thought you were crazy. I’m like, “I’m not gonna be young for the rest of my life. I want to experience these things while I can still move.” And, so that was my philosophy. So–and it worked for me for a while, you know? I was like, I was getting clients, the money was okay, I was able to support myself. Um…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: But before we get into that, I want to dwell on this for a little bit because the reason why–and some of you guys that are tuning in or watching this later will realize really quickly–the reason why I brought Aaron on the show was because he can speak to and relate to so many things that you guys think. So here we are: We’re two contrasting personalities. You, you come–we’re both, we, we came out of the world kinda poor, and we worked our way out of it, but you came from a really small town, some financial hardships, and some, some family life that was less than ideal, but you worked through all that stuff, right? You made it work, and–but there was this idea of you just wanting to be (this is where we differ) this “solopreneur,” doing the work yourself and doing it all by yourself, and having great pride in being able to do it, and then saying, “What’s wrong with you? Why don’t you want to enjoy your life and I can’t see that. You’re like probably just grinding away at the, in the salt mine, kind of in the cubicle, if you will,” even though I didn’t work in a cubicle. And on the flipside, I’m over here thinking, “This guy has so much potential. He could do so many things but he just needs to learn to grow up at some point in his life.” And I’m just using it in the broadest sense, like, you’re a mature person, but I was just thinking: “Why doesn’t your work evolve? Like, my work doesn’t look the same as it did just a few years ago, let alone when I was in my 20s. I needed to do work that was going to be appealing to companies that could afford to pay me what I wanted to be paid.” I just want to get a little bit of your mindset. How you viewed yourself versus me and just, this is your opportunity to just dog on me if you want (at that point in time).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@21:01&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah. I, I think…I, I think a lot of my motivation was: “I’m just gonna work hard.” And that’s where it came from my childhood and growing up on a farm, it was like, “That’s gonna get me through tough times. It’s like, just the solution is just to work really hard.” And, and I did–I wasn’t looking very, sort of, proactively, like, “What’s gonna happen long-term?” Uh, because I had a certain level of success early on, um, branching out as a solopreneur, I thought that was it, like, it was just things were gonna happen and materialize and it was just gonna happen. I was just a lot of–a lot of things were very reactive, um, where the clients came in, um, and how I adjusted with those clients, but, it wasn’t until, you know, I fell on some hardships where it made me sort of reanalyze who I was as a person, uh, especially at that time in my life where, uh, now I’m in my late 30s, I, I expected a, you know, a certain level of success and, and comfort, and, you know, having stability and um, finances, stability in sort of my relationships and really, I started to uncover that I didn’t have a lot of these things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And that’s when there was that, that “oh crap” moment, and um, that sort of come-to-Jesus, like, “Uh, maybe I do need to grow up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@22:14&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well let’s talk about that. So this is where I think we wanted to kind of pivot and we can circle back, you guys, if you want to ask those question on Facebook and on YouTube that we have two guys in the other room, along with Erica, Emmanuel, and Sam (two interns joining us here). So they’ll be monitoring your comments and you guys lets me know if you hear a really good question, okay? Feel free, feel free to interrupt us. Let’s talk about this point of, of change in your life. What happened here? So, I think if you guys were paying attention, if you were alive during this time in 2008, basically the, the bottom of the universe opened up as far as it’s concerned with the financial market. People were committing suicide, stocks (like Apple stock was like at 18 dollars a share), everybody thought the total economy was going to collapse and it impacted so many businesses (ours, too). And so let’s, let’s talk a little bit about 2018, uh 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@23:02&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, so I think my, my business and myself was really just kind of on cruise-control, and things were fine, you know, there was money in the bank and, um, I was living the life I wanted to live. I had a lifestyle that I enjoyed, and then I think it was around 2007 is when the, the housing market sort of burst and the stock market went kind of, kind of went bonkers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: The subprime…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Right? And what happened is, clients, the phone stopped ringing, and that was when, um, I saw the bank account starting to dwindle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: How much was in the bank account at this point in time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: You know, I, I think I was always right around anywhere from 5 to 20 thousand dollars?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And–but that was fine when money was continually coming through, but then once the phone stopped ringing, uh, I had to re-evaluate what was happening. Um, I think a lot of my clients, uh, they would keep the work in-house now because their marketing budgets were a lot tighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Uh, companies or start-ups who were thinking about bringing something to market, they didn’t have that luxury anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: They didn’t have financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Banks didn’t loan any money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, and so there was just, absolutely nothing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, money dried up all over the place and I think I remember, too, two of your bigger clients in the action-sports space, they had problems financially, too, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, I think, uh, in the action-sports industry, I did a lot of, um, lifestyle brands, um, action-sports and their sponsors stopped sponsoring the events, and so, those events just, they just disappeared. Another big client I had at the time I had a retainer with (Honda motorcycles), and so retainer is they, they had a one-year contract and I would get paid monthly, so it was kinda like a salary, so it was that stability. Um, they stopped having work because they then tightened-up their budget and kept everything in-house, and so then that was that moment where I needed to figure out what to do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@25:01&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well this kind of stuff doesn’t happen overnight. There’s a slow progression or, it might feel like it happens overnight, but–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It felt like it happened overnight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right. Like, one client calls you and says, “Aaron, it’s been great working with you, but we can’t do this anymore.” There goes Honda. The action sports guys say, “We can’t do the next event this year, all our sponsors pulled out.” And, slowly but surely you start to see that 20 thousand become 18, becomes 12, becomes 8…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And so talk to me. When did it hit rock bottom for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It, it was pretty quick. Um, I knew that (I mean), I probably started living beyond my means (‘cause I had a nice car)–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@25:37&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And I, I was more concerned about status and what people thought of me, so I, I kind of was–had a certain lifestyle that I was used to living. Eating out, dressing a certain way, um, and so when I couldn’t afford to do those things, and the money wasn’t coming in, that’s when I’m like: “Okay, what do I do now? Do I, do I actually brush off my résumé and look for another job?” And I had a lot of pride because I sort of had a certain level of success with Farm Design and, um, I’d built something. To feel like I had to let that go and, you know, suck up my pride and go on interviews again, it was really tough. And I actually did that. I had to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You, you put together your resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I put together my portfolio, I put–uh, I rewrote my résumé, um, this is my late 30s now and I was going to, I went to a couple job interviews and I never got the work. I’m like, “Wait, wait a minute. I thought my stuff was pretty good.” But, they weren’t hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Why do you think that was?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think everyone was starving. Everyone was hungry, everyone was looking for work. Uh, they had to be über selective about who they picked because, you know, they probably had limited resources as well and maybe I just didn’t fit. I think also maybe my portfolio was very one-dimensional, but that worked for me in terms of my business model. I focused heavily on, uh, an action-sports sort of “youth-lifestyle” sort of. That’s who I appealed to, those are the type of clients I appealed to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: How did that make you feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@27:13&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Uh, pretty inferior, actually. Um, it, it, it made me think and it kept me up late at night, uh, just wondering like okay, what did I do wrong? Um, you know. The fear of, “Can I make my car payment? Can I, can I pay for rent? What is my girlfriend gonna think?” It’s, it’s those sort of things, like, it can emasculate you, so, yeah. I think, you know, I–that was the time when I like, really hit rock bottom. It wasn’t fun. It was scary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I can, I can only imagine. I mean, even the act of putting together your résumé, not as a design exercise, but because you actually have to go out and get work, that just must have been hard to say, like, “Okay, it was a good run. It’s been 8 or so years and it’s been great, and now I have to change and everything is changing and…did you start to regret some of the decisions that you made prior to that point? Because sometimes when you’re in that dark place–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: –you ask, “Why did I buy that expensive car? What, why did I not take that opportunity, or there was that one client that I could have done something different from but I walked away ‘cause I was too or what. I don’t know what it was. I’m just…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, I don’t think I regretted the decisions I made with my business. I, I look back at it as a learning experience, like, “Okay, I probably should have done something different. Um, I, I certainly (I think with a lot of people) lived beyond my means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, having a nice car and living a certain way, and at the end of the day, what does that all really mean? It’s, it’s superficial. And it took sort of hitting that rock-bottom to start to see those things, and re-evaluate and, um, assess who I was and, and if I needed to change my mindset to sort of right the ship because everything was, like, the business, the accounting, the–my relationships, it was like, it all kind of like came to a head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Did it cause friction in your relationship?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It certainly didn’t help. Yeah. Um, because we split all of the–at the time, I was in a long relationship as well, and I think I wasn’t–probably it was a 15-year relationship&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And so, why didn’t I commit to that person, so I think there was a lot of things I didn’t want to grow up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So, you know, that whole “Peter Pan” syndrome thing. It, it affected everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: If the label fits you well. I know you resented me even throwing that at you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I didn’t even know what that meant when you brought it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I made it up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Peter Pan. Peter Pan never grows up!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That was me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Wow, okay, so if you guys want to get the razor blades out, now would be a good time to actually put them away ‘cause we’re gonna, we’re gonna pivot. There’s a reason why Aaron is here. I wanted him, and I’ve encouraged him to just kind of open his heart and share some of the pain points there because what happens next, I think we can learn a lot from. Now if we had a commercial break, this is when I would cut to a commercial break, but we don’t, so we’re gonna keep going!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: That’s how we roll. Okay, so I’m gonna bring up this slide here, and I remember you doing this (I have my thoughts and opinions on this as well), but you started another business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Let me, let me just set the stage and then you, you take it from there. So, so here you are, you can’t get clients because you actually didn’t build a sales pipeline or sales or marketing strategy and all the things that you had done in the past, are no longer applicable because there are too many buyers and too few sellers. Oh, I’m sorry, let me say that the opposite: There are too few buyers and too many sellers of work, and so, you went out and tried to get a job. You did the whole resume dog-and-pony show and you weren’t able to get the work either, so now it’s like, what does a person do? And you got pushed into a pretty tight corner. This is when you started a company called “Mugo,” a portable MP3 music player–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yep.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: –that was kind of tapping into a big trend, and the trend was custom-vinyl-artwork, built around artists that have a following. Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Take it away from there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@31:03&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, I, I think when I, when I was at that place in my career, I…I, I had to make a decision: Do I just bury my head in the sand and just, you know, did I fail or do I try to learn from my mistakes and do something with it? And when the opportunities weren’t knocking, they say to build a door and so because no one else was calling me, that I felt like I needed to create my own opportunities. Um, I took a lot of the lessons, uh, I realized I learned a lot, design, doing branding for my clients in helping them build something. Seeing their vision come to fruition. Um, so I’m like, “Well I need to take the lessons that I have, the skills that I have, the foundation and do that for myself.” So I was very passionate about music and collecting vinyl toys, which, you know, I think I probably got a lot from you because you collect a lot of vinyl toys as well and I think I got that inspiration and I, I created this thing called a “Mugo” and what my goal was to bring a product to market. I didn’t know what I was doing. It was all just by the seat of my pants. Um, literally, uh, designed something, um, try to figure out how to find, uh, vendors and manufacturers. I knew that I needed to go to China because looking for local vendors, it was too expensive and the price-point wasn’t right, so like, how do I find vendors in Asia? And then, so a lot of this stuff was incredibly reactive, but I had a goal, like I needed to create another sort of income source. I’m gonna create my own business, separate from branding. And that’s what Mugo was. Um, and that was probably a two-year “labor of love,” getting that thing. Trying to get it off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, and then, sort of, in the middle, there’s occasionally those small little projects that might come in, but I was, I was–that whole time–I was, everything was running on fumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I remember.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I remember. So sometimes…a wise friend could come in and offer you advice, and you would ignore it because of our competitive spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@33:07&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And then, sometimes life sends you another message, knocking at your door, and pulls the rug out from underneath you, and you can’t attribute these…the “global forces at work,” if you will–this whole “subprime market,” it just “bottomed-out” as something that is a consequence of your action, things just do happen, but then it’s in those moments you learn that, “Oh, we didn’t prepare that emergency earthquake kit. Oh, snap! Now we gotta go do something about it.” And you tried one thing after the other, and, where is it in this part of your journey is it that you start to make these kind of fundamental changes that lead you to kinda where we’re gonna take this conversation in a little bit. What happened? Can you, can you remember? What were the triggers and how did your mindset change? Because so much of what we try to teach on this show is about “mindset.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@33:57&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah. I, I think one thing that I took from my childhood, and my, my growing up on a farm and an agricultural community is, uh, my father always taught us to, sort of, “feed the soil and not the plant.” And it was a very literal uh, um, lesson that he was trying to teach us. And what that, what that meant was, in, in order for the crop to thrive is you really need to put your focus on the soil. And, so, he taught us how to fertilize the soil, how to do crop rotation, so all of these things it was, was putting the focus on, on a foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@34:35&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And, and if you focus on the foundation, then that crop will thrive and you’ll be sustainable. If you, if you lose focus on that foundation or the soil in this metaphor, um that’s, that plant will eventually wither and die. So, when I was going through this transition, I, I was–uh–reminded of that lesson and, and used it as a metaphor that I think what I had spent so much of my time focusing on was, like myself and what I thought other people, um, wha–the importance of what they thought of me, the type of car I drove, the type of clothes I wore–and I focus more I guess on the plant, and I didn’t focus on the foundation. So, I shifted, needed to shift in my mindset to, um, thinking in a belief system that is more long-term and more foundational. So by developing something like creating my own product as something that, um, I can put a lot of the, the work into creating it. But then that would have sort of long-term effects in terms of sales, and the lessons that I learned from that I can parlay that into other opportunities. Um, and I think that’s what truly happened when I, when I started to do that–is that other opportunities came out through this experience. Uh, opportunities that I didn’t even foresee, but um, but then I sort of grasped those opportunities, and I think that’s when things started to happen. The big shift was, in conjunction with Mugo ‘cause I had to fund that and I had to just survive, is I needed to decide like, “How am I going to grow my business?” if that’s what I wanted to do. And I was reminded of, of what you always told me is like, I think there was, there was someone you met. There was a kid you met at a portfolio review and you called me up and you said, “Hey, there’s this kid, you know, he’s, he’s okay. I, I liked his energy. Give him a call. Um, try him out as an intern. Just give him one day a week.” And, you know, at that point, it’s like, I have nothing to lose. And so, I actually listened to you that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: The one time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: The one time–or maybe the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, the first time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@36:44&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was the first time. And so, uh, I called him, he came in and I interviewed him, and his portfolio was, you know, it was average, but I, I did like his energy, and so I said, “Okay, I’m gonna take this leap of faith, I don’t know how I’m gonna pay for this kid, you know, it was 10 dollars an hour, and so I said, “Well, what if I, if I fed you lunch everyday, too, would, does that sound appealing?” And he said–he was as hungry as I was. So I, I hired him, and I said, “Let’s come in, let’s try two days a week.” And he didn’t have a vehicle, and he drove a bus, it took him 2 to 2 and a half hours just to get to my place, so I knew that he was really passionate and hungry as well. So what I started to see is this, what I thought as like, maybe this kid can help me with small little tasks and errands, is what it did is it really sort of lit a fire and it re-sort of, um, brought the passion back and the energy for my craft as a designer because, uh, he would come in and I would give him tasks and I would teach him certain things and I could see the look on his face when I would teach him these things, and, and that sort of, sort of fueled my fire, and then, surprisingly what I did not expect, is he taught me a lot of things–’cause I had way too much pride. I thought I knew everything. I thought I knew everything. But he taught me a lot of things, and that’s when I sort of had a really big pivot point in my career and my life and um, looking at myself like, you know, maybe I don’t know everything. Maybe I need to re-look at this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@38:15&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I-I look at my career when I was a, a solopreneur, and I look at it as, as I was a–really a small plant in a small pot. I was this one guy in my apartment, working in this little room, wake up and I’d go to the room and I’d do my work. I was a plant in a small pot, and what I needed to do was focus on that foundation and, and grow that foundation, so I needed to get a bigger pot, so I could allow sort of my roots to grow. So, I got another computer, um, I got another workstation, I got the intern and we started doing stuff and things started happening. I didn’t know what it was, but I just knew something was different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm. Okay. Let’s hold that thought for a second here. I want to que up Emmanuel and Sam and, and Erica. If you guys have any questions, get your questions ready. I just want to read some comments from the livechat. People are saying: (This is Akman Raw–I don’t know how to say your name, but he’s like) “I’ve learned so much within the last 30 minutes.” So thank you for saying that. People are saying, “This is amazing.” Uh, “Salut.” “Teach and learn, Farm Design.” Uhh, “Amazing, you guys.” “Check it out.” “Mind blown.” So some good energy coming in. I wanted to share that with you so you could feel some of the audience feedback. Uh, uh I have tons of thoughts and ideas and questions to kind of dive in, but I’mma kick it out to the new dream team. New dream team, you got any questions or comments about this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Emmanuel] We have a question from Lallitz Gallery, umm, he’s asking, “How does a solopreneur handle his/her company during a recession?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I think you’re hearing it right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I believe you’re exactly hearing the story of how a solopreneur handles their company during a recession. And we’re gonna talk a little bit more about that so let’s okay, that’s a good question. Anything else? Anything? You guys can ask your own question, you guys. As you’re listening to the story, both of you guys are graphic designers. Emmanuel, raise your hand so people know who you are. So Emmanuel’s from, from, from Italy. From Milan?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, so, it’s ironic that you’re here and I’ll be going to Milan in a couple of weeks. That’s kind of weird. You come and I–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: I’ve been waiting for you for ages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I’m sorry. And then Sam. Sam’s from Art Center, right? You’re studying graphic design. What, what term and major are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Sam]: Um, I’m about 8th term at Art Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh! You’re about to graduate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: Yeah. So, haha. Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, any questions so far, you guys? As you’re hearing Aaron just pour his heart out here, just on the table and the floor! You got anything for us? Erica, I, I hear, I hear you smiling and laughing in the background, so, what’s, what’s resonating and what’s connecting with you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Erica]: Uh, well mostly I’m focusing on the edit…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: But, it is really great to hear a story, um, of how someone got started and the troubles they went through, and how they realized their mindset, and I’m looking forward to, to more of it, even though half of my attention is mostly on the edit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, okay. But I, I hear your smiling and laughing at the key moments. Uh, when I make my little jokes and insert the jabs, so I, I know you’re paying attention. Okay. Anyways, people are wondering what happened to Aaron and Molly. Are they gone forever? And yes, they are gone forever. Or have they been shipped off to another country? No, they’re in the other room, working very hard, you guys. Just relax. We’re bringing in lots of different kinds of people, different energy for the topics that are relevant to them and what they’re passionate about. So let’s talk a little bit about this, so, before we kind of just broke away for a moment from the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@41:39&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You’re kind of in this dark place. You don’t know what else to do. So you wind up bringing in somebody to help you. And I have to imagine, because I think we had these conversations before, and this is gonna touch upon a lot of what our audience is gonna feel. So when you’re not successful, you feel like, “Well who am I to take on people and to mentor? Like, I’m not even worthy of doing that. And, I’m barely making it as it is, financially. How can I afford to bring in another person? What are they gonna do for me? I don’t have any work to do, what the heck are they gonna do?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right? Does that sound about fair?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It’s pretty fair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, now so despite all that, you finally, finally let some words of wisdom trickle into the thick skull. And you actually do bring in a kid. You bring in a kid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@42:22&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And it was very generous of you, actually, because a lot of people do unpaid internships, and for you even to say, “Look, I, I, I’ll pay you hourly and then I’ll buy your lunch,” because you’re a good guy. So if you have a loaf of bread, I think you’re the type of guy who doesn’t just cut half and give it to his employee. You cut whatever you think the employee needs and you eat the crumbs that are leftover. So kudos to you, you’re a good, you’re a good man, Charlie Brown. You are. Okay? So you bring in a guy and you start to learn how to delegate. You learn how to collaborate. You learn how to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Absolutely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@42:55&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And most importantly, you’re, you’re teaching and you’re sharing what you know. And this is what they, they always say (like, teachers say this and it’s a cliché, but it’s totally true): “You learn more from the student than they will ever learn from you.” And, and I wanna explain that a little bit, but I don’t want to explain it. I want you to do it. Like, what do you mean when you say that, like, you didn’t realize you would learn so much by actually having somebody that you were gonna teach?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@43:21&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think it’s interesting…um, teaching someone things that you know. First of all, I really didn’t think I knew that much. I think I had certain levels of skill, but I say, “If you’ve been paying attention in life, you should’ve, you should learn something.” And so, having someone there where you can bounce ideas off and, and share information you realize, um, how much you actually do know. And then it starts a conversation. And that conversation stimulates and challenges each other, and I think that’s what it, it–one of the challenges of working by yourself is, “Who’s there to challenge yourself?” It’s like, do you have that intern–, that internal sort of voice that, that can do it for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@44:02&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So, having an intern or a student there who can, that can challenge you on your thoughts, who can bring new, uh, dialogue and information to the table, I think is what really started to, um, where I started to grow up as a person…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A] And made me want to learn more so I can share more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And so, we started with that collaboration. Between the two of us, uh, I, I think, I felt like I was becoming a better person and more knowledgeable, and I could see him, he was always there on time, everyday, the front door, ready to go, to, to the next task and so, that just sparked the fuel even more, and like, “Okay, where do I take this? What’s the next step?” And so I brought in another intern because the work started picking up. Um, and so I brought in another person. At that point I, I had moved and I had a house…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And, um…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So we’re gonna, we’re gonna talk. We’re gonna do the transition talk right now? Is that right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Roughly, but I think it’s, it’s important because, uh, I, I had a garage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So, I moved out of the apartment with the spare bedroom and I now had a house with a garage…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@45:19&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And a yard. And, I put in more computers. And so I’m like: “Okay.” I felt comfortable bringing that one person on. So little baby steps, little progressions, sort of, uh, scaffolding my, uh, my efforts and, and trying to build for something greater. Uh, I didn’t want to jump in head-first. I was doing little baby steps, but at least I was moving forward with the goal that I needed to do something where I can be sustainable and something that I can have to grow my business, and um, and my career. So I hired another employee. Um, it was my–it started out as an internship, uh, she was fantastic, and so I offered her a job after a few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: But we were in the garage! And, it was difficult–I was surprised that she took the job offer because it’s like, this person who just graduated school, who I thought was incredibly talented, why would she want to come and work in my garage? So she saw something, I think in me, perhaps? I think she saw something in, in my vision, like how I wanted to grow the business, and so I needed to get that bigger pot, and so I took another leap of faith, and I got an office space in Old Town Pasadena. So, it scared me to death because now I have more expenses, more overhead, I have to pay for rent and utilities, and more computers, and the salary, um, so, it’s, it’s pushing me out of my comfort zone is really what allowed me to start to grow and, and, um, mature as an individual, and mature as a business owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm. Okay, so, we’re gonna cut to my slides here. This is where Aaron’s office is now, right on the main strip in Old Town Pasadena. It’s right on Colorado. He’s right there above the Vans shoe store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Vans Shoes and…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah. And something else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It’s that second floor there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And Lush. And you can see him on the second floor there with the orange lights. And I’m gonna show you guys a little about his office space. And he’s gone through some expansion. Uh, you’ve knocked out some walls and kind of moved–opened up your office, and soon, I think, you’ll probably outgrow that office, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right? That’s a probability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That pot is probably…I’m out growing that pot, and so I’ll probably need to get a bigger pot. So, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, it needs to just continue to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So here, you can see Aaron with his dog, Shelly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Shelby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Shelby! And, and some of his staff. Alright. And now we’re gonna look at some of his work…I know the Internet is really smart, so all our fans are probably already crawling all over your Behance site or on your website itself–uh, your website proper. But let’s take a look at some of your work. So, now you’re in the food and bev space and you’re doing really well. You’re killin’ it. You’re, you’re branding some really awesome restaurants and, just, really fun “dream” projects, if you will. Doing things from (What is this?) Craft Cider, and to Cold Brew Coffee from Califa, Califia?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Calif-fee-ya?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Calif-fee-ya, thank you. And then doing coffee packaging for Static.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And some fashion stuff, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@48:22&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: You’ll start to notice that I transitioned away from youth-lifestyle, and into…um, a portfolio that can appeal to clientele that probably could afford to pay us, that I can afford to pay my staff, and so, in order for me to do that, I had to get out of my comfort zone of doing what I knew, while I needed to–we needed to craft a portfolio that can attract clients that we wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And so…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I feel like I’ve heard that before. How…I can’t put my…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: …finger on it. I just…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think I came up with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, probably. Okay, keep going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: But I think uh, from a lot of your audience, it’s like, how do you get to that next level? How, how do you attract a certain clientele?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@49:05&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And, I, I learned this from students, is, uh, I would ask–be asked to do a lot of portfolio reviews at my alma mater at Cal. State Northridge and AIGA, and, there was always–I’d get the portfolio from the student and it would be their–they would show work from school task, and it, the projects that they were probably the most proud of were something that was actually, they, did in real life that was actually printed, but oftentimes those projects weren’t that good. It’s like: “Oh, I designed this logo and this brochure for a bank,” for example, and I’m looking at–the design is not that great, but they think it’s the best piece in their portfolio because it was actually printed, or there was an actual client. And so, I, I learned from that, that, you know,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@49:49&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I don’t think you have to show something that you actually did, I’d rather you, you show me something that’s, uh, exemplifies your capabilities and your design skills. So if that means you have to do something on your own, or if, if you’re in class and your professor gives you a project, do the project, but then go the next step, and, and expand on that project and that system, uh, for your portfolio. So from that lesson (‘cause I didn’t want to look at projects that didn’t appeal to me), so when I started, uhh, sort of “Farm Design 2.0,” and I have employees, like, we needed to like, um, attract a new clientele, so we asked ourselves, “What sort of clients do we want to attract?” And we would, we were interested in maybe doing some sort of beverage company, we liked coffee, so, and we liked restaurants, so I tasked the, um, my employees, “Okay, let’s come up with a hypothetical project, and let’s start crafting something.” So we actually put a project brief together, we, we acted like we were the clients and we needed to have parameters, so it wasn’t the wild west and just running all over the place. We needed to have parameters, and we designed things, we mocked them up, we shot them for our portfolio, we put them out there. We put it out on Dribble, we put it out on our website, and then people started calling because they liked something–a beverage project, and then they had a beverage project themselves. And so we started getting clients based on the work that we were putting out there. So we weren’t waiting for clients to come to us, we were like, “Okay, we need to put something out there, you know, put a little bait in the water for them to bite and so we could bring them in. We have to craft something.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Uh, a good example is, uhh, we…we, I! I had an opportunity for a restaurant branding project. Honestly, I don’t remember how the guy found us, he was gonna do a pizza shop, and that was extremely exciting. It would have been our first restaurant project. He came in–and this is when we first opened our office in Pasadena, we didn’t have a lot of furniture, we didn’t have anything on the walls, it was like, I was like: “Oh my God! I, we have to look professional!” So we were actually printing stuff out and putting them on the wall like we were like super busy. He came into the office and, and we would pretend like we were really busy and we did the dog-and-pony show, and he, I thought for sure we got the project. And he didn’t call us back. And I was like, that was our opportunity to get into the restaurant business. But because we didn’t get that project, I’m like, “Okay, guys. We need to create that hypothetical restaurant project.” And we took that as an opportunity, and we put that on the Internet, and then we started getting calls to do restaurant projects. But I think that only works if you do good work. It can’t be mediocre work. Otherwise, you’re going to probably get mediocre clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I don’t think anybody wants medio–mediocre work, period. Even mediocre clients don’t want mediocre work. Let me, let me ask you a couple of questions. So you’re fussing about doing this artwork, trying to create the appearance and the facade that you’re a happening studio, and then you don’t get the work. Any other reasons why you don’t think you got the work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@52:55&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think there wasn’t a certain polish. I still was sort of refining sort of our, our game in terms of, “How do we sell our skills?” Look, “Who are we?” We were still trying to define who we were, um, so I think they didn’t have necessarily confidence in our ability. We probably didn’t have that body of work yet, um, to sort of lean against, um, so I think there was, there was two-fold. Um, did they have the, the trust in our ability to put–to do something? And, do you have something to support that, that I can see? They like case studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah. I’m gonna mention a couple of things, ‘cause, I want to fill in some of the gaps for our audience. I remember talking to you about this and, and, and I think I’m glad that you’ve ultimately had made those changes, but I remember looking at your portfolio. So now you, you have your foot half into this other world (we’ll just call it the “adult world”), and half of the other foot in the youthful action-sports-lifestyle brand world. And I think even at this point (‘cause you and I, we’ve had so many conversations, especially when you still lived in Santa Monica), we’d go out to lunch, first it would be once a week, and then twice a week, and it seemed like we’re having lunch every single day. And I was just meeting up with you, we would chat, basically, just trying to help a friend level-up his business game, which is something I felt really good about. But I remember seeing like really beautiful, mature typography and work for real estate clients, and some beautiful identity design work that was in conflict with this other (if you guys remember back to surf brands, those kind of stuff he was doing), it was diametrically opposed in look and tone. So I, I don’t know if I articulated that clearly to you at that point in time. You do need to make a choice. Because it’s, it’s kind of schizophrenic. People show up at your site, they’re gonna see something or they’re gonna ask themselves: “Which designer am I getting? Am I getting the more sophisticated, mature person who can understand big businesses? Or do I want that youthful, edgy energy?” And I think at that point you weren’t quite ready to let that go, but ultimately you did, and you started to change portfolios. So, a recurring theme here–that I’m gonna try to do my best to articulate is your ability to look in the moment, and make some really hard decisions that seem to go against every fiber of your being. We trace it back to “I just want to do the work,” “I have great pride and ownership,” “I think it’s good–and it’s ethical for me to do the work,” and then to let that go, to let that go and it transformed you. Then to take on more employees and then to make a big commitment. Anybody that’s been out there who has had to sign a lease, it’s like a 3-year lease, you’re making a commitment–a promise to pay somebody else rent that you’re not sure if you’re going to be able to do for the next 3 years. That is a big “gut-check” moment. And you’re doing all these things (you call them “small, scaffolding steps”), but really, they’re giant commitments internally that you have to get over. And to also let go of some of the past to make room for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And you did all that and I, I–kudos to you. It took you awhile (I, I always say, like, you would be ten times big and successful if you just moved a little faster), but you’re, you’re super successful now, and I want to show a little bit more of your work. But, there’s another thing that I want to talk about here and you’ve mentioned it a couple of times so I feel that I need to point it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@56:00&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: When Hugh Barton was on here, the psychotherapist, he talked about the difference between “self-confidence” and “self-esteem.” I’ve never heard this before explained this way (and I hope I don’t butcher this prat): “self-confidence” is how you feel about you and your work when nobody is around; “self-esteem” is how you feel when other people are around. And I think they’re one and the same because you truly cannot be self-confident if you don’t have the self-esteem. Well, why is that? Because you had mentioned twice now that you brought in this superstar designer, and you weren’t sure if she would want to work with you because you’re working out of your garage. So I’ve never suffered from that because I always thought, “I have a lot to share, and the work is going to be really good.” Don’t worry about the Ikea tables and the cardboard box that we work out of. And then that, that popped up again when you had clients come in, and you’re like: “Oh! Let’s make sure we look a certain way!” When I wanted to spend all my energy working on the internal, working on the mindset, the self-esteem, the self-confidence, so I could learn how to talk to people. ‘Cause in theory then, when all that stuff goes away, when it, when it gets torched or something happens, you still have the stuff inside, and that’s the important stuff. But, the last thing that you mentioned, which is (a thing that we referred to as “closing the gap”), a lot of creative people, they know their fullest potential and they keep saying to themselves: “If a client ever gave me the opportunity, I would do this amazing work!” What they’re doing is they’re putting the burden of work and the leap of faith and the risk in the client’s hands. You said to yourself, very wisely: “We want to do this kind of work. Realistically, looking at our own work, we’re not going to get this kind of work based on our portfolio. So we need to make the time and energy and, and put the resources together to, to put this kind of work out.” And it, and you for, for doing what you did, almost–it felt instant results. You put out the projects, it got talked about, it got shared on all these sites and these blogs, and then all this attention was now turned onto you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And it was wonderful, so you were rewarded for making your efforts about showing the people, the world, the potential that you believed in yourself, but hadn’t shown before. And that’s how you go about and get this work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@58:05&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So you guys out there that are scratching your head and thinking about this right now, how do I make that transition from being a “poor, broke person” (but not broken person, just a broke person), and, how do I make that transition? How do I get out of that? So close the gap. You have to do good work. All of the conversation we’re having right now, you guys, means that you have to know your craft. That’s the beginning part, but that’s not the end. That’s just the beginning. Okay. Any other questions? And I’mma show more of your work and we’re gonna kind of figure out like life lessons, things that you can peel away from this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Any other kind of questions, you guys? People are saying this is like the “best livestream ever,” it’s like, that’s a little hyperbolic, but I’ll take that. Okay. Somebody’s putting in quotes (air quotes). Gianfranco, uhh, he’s saying “Adult-design equals money?” I don’t know. Alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: We got a couple of questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You do? Okay, fire away, man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: Yeah, um, this one comes from Galley Taylor?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright, speak into the mic, dude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: Oh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: This one comes from Galley Taylor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Much better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[S]: And, she’s asking, uh, if: “When you look for a client–uh, when you look for clients, do you look for one with definite budgets for service, or do you look, do you work with clients to organically develop a budget for your service?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Do you understand the question?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yes, I do. You know I was, when you’re hungry, you’ll take any client. So when you’re developing and you’re trying to build that foundation, you’ll take pretty much any client, as long as they’re willing to pay you for your craft. So as you evolve and you become, um, more polished, uh, I think the rules change a little bit and, um, I think, fortunately for, uh, my business (Farm Design) that uh, we’ve evolved quite a bit in a really short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@59:53&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And so the rules that I look for in a, in work, uh, I call it the sort of the “3 Ps.” It’s 3 rules I wanna try to hit and I, to determine if it’s the right project for us and, and the 3 Ps are: Portfolio, profit, and people. So portfolio is, I look at it when someone calls me, is it gonna be a project that I get really excited about? A juicy project? Something that I, I want to put into my portfolio? I want to take pride in? Um, the other one is: profit. Uh, I want to assess to see if the, the client is qualified, if they have a budget, and, uh, so I dig deeper, and I, you know, you ask those questions, sometimes it’s unveiled when you, when you do a proposal. And the third one is, um: people. Um, they say like 85% of your problems come from 15% of your clients, um…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s actually 80-20, it’s the Pareto Principle, but yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:00:50&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So I fudged it a little?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So I’ve worked with a lot of–what I consider–like, “bad” clients, and, and it just, it takes the soul out of you when you work with certain people that either they don’t respect you or they don’t respect your craft, or conversely so. So I think it’s really important when you’re in a business relationship that, um, it’s a healthy relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:01:11&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So my role is: I need to have at least 2 of those working for me. You can’t just have one and I think that the, the unicorn is if you can have all 3. So, when assessing like type of work that uh we want to work for, or the type of people, um, so I don’t necessarily have to have make money every single time I take a job if the people I respect and they’re fun to work with, and it’s a portfolio piece that’s really exciting. ‘Cause I know that’s an investment that’s gonna get the next job. Um, but you can do any, any combination, but for me it’s gotta be at least 2 out of those 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah. Okay. 2 out of the 3. Any other questions? Emmanuel? Sam?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Yeah, we have a question from…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Fire away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Jaimie Montaño. Uhh, she’s asking: “How do you produce good work when you’re in a hurry because you’re super low on cash?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You got it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:01:59&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah. “How do you produce work?” I, I don’t believe in working fast. I, I think, um, as a, as a creative director guiding my design staff, I, I never say: “Work faster. Hurry up.” Because I, I think you’re just going to get inferior work. They’re just gonna like, “Uhhhhhhh.” There’s gonna–there’s that tension and they’re trying to craft something. I, I believe in being highly productive, and so, um, trying to do something in a short period of time, I think, part of it is you gotta be realistic with the project and the timelines that you take on. I, I think it would be a disservice to your client if you take on a project that you can’t meet the deadlines, and if you can’t do it at a certain uh standard and quality that, uh, that you believe in, then, you, you, you simply shouldn’t take it. You have to be able to walk away from a project because ultimately you’re going to tarnish that relationship and they’re not gonna come back. Um, I buh–I believe in building relationships so that client continues to come back. I, I’m personally not a salesperson, so I, I don’t do traditional-like sales, cold calls. I don’t do a lot of outbound sort of marketing ‘cause it’s just not my style, so, when I have an opportunity to work with a client, I wanna make sure I, I put my best foot forward because I want to be able to continue that working relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:03:19&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Do you guys have a follow-up question for him? I’m trying to monitor Facebook and, and YouTube as well. Wel, why don’t we do this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: I…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, go ahead, Erica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Um, so, do you have any projects that you regret doing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Any projects that…?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You regret doing? Any projects that you regret doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:03:38&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Oh, wow. That’s a great question. Absolutely. I’m trying to–haha–I, I think, oftentimes, the projects that I regret are because I didn’t align or have the same values or principles as my client. Um, so I think it’s not necessarily uh if I made money or didn’t make money, if, or, um, if it’s uh, a portfolio piece or not, I think the projects that I regret most are aligning with someone that they didn’t respect our craft or I didn’t respect their vision, and so, I try to avoid those relationships. But! Sometimes you don’t know until you get into that relationship, so, it’s, it’s, it’s challenging and, and sometimes you have to be willing to accept the fact that it may not be a good relationship and like, and just, say, “You know, I just don’t think it’s a good fit. And I think, uh, I wish you the best of luck,” and you just part ways. But, um, “projects that you regret,” it’s…I think, I will continue to encounter those, and–but I’m always trying to like do my, uh, best due diligence to sort of curb the, that. But it’s, it’s challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Uh, I have a follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[E]: Um, so how do you deal with those projects where you realize that “Maybe we shouldn’t have taken this?” But you did and then you have to follow through with it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:05:08&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I seldom, I, I don’t like to leave people in a lurch. I think there’s something about my personality, so, I, I, I don’t typically will walk away from a challenging situation. Um, I, I think if it’s the, the client, and it’s a tumultuous relationship where there’s tension and we’re not seeing eye to eye, then I’m just gonna have that conversation with them that, you know, I think maybe there’s someone better for you. And then we sort of figure out some sort of exit strategy. I think otherwise if we continue down this uh, this tumultuous relationship then I don’t think we’re gonna be able to produce our best work, the experience is gonna be tarnished and at the end, ultimately, neither party is gonna be happy, so, why go through that, that long process? I think it’s best to just be open and transparent, and just say, “I, I think we’re not the best fit.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. I, I wrote down some things here. Let’s see here. There was a question from YouTube that asked: “Is that fake restaurant project still available on your site somewhere? And what’s it called?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It’s not on our website anymore, but it lives on the Internet because one of the great things is…the, there’s a, an influential blog called “The Dieline”…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, there’s a, other blogs out there, and when we put projects out there, and with technology and social media, um, people pick it up if it’s noteworthy and they share that information. So, the projects still live out there, I think the one I was referring to is called “Old Boy Blues?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm. I’m gonna find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: “Old Boy Blues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And, the designer that worked on that, she was actually an intern at my company. She is now my art director and she’s been with me for 5 years. So, this project was, you know, it was kind of a labor of love and we, we were like trying to feel it out. And it was all mock-ups. It was hypo–purely hypothetical, but that got us our first restaurant project and today, we, we do a ton of restaurant work and I think on any given day, we’re probably working on 2 or 3 restaurant projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I am not finding your project here. But I will trying finding–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: “Old Boy…Blues?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Uhh, I’ll try, but let me do “Farm Design” and see what I come up with. You can keep talking to me while I find this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, I think, um, talking about how, um, technology can help drive marketing for yourself, is even the Mugo project that we were referring to earlier is, it got picked up by The Dieline. I didn’t expect this. Um, they picked it up because I had posted something on my website, uh, The Dieline picked it up and posted it, and then I started getting all these calls, and one of the calls I got was from Dreamworks. Uh, Dreamworks contacted me and they said they wanted to do uh, a licensing partnership deal with me on, on Mugo. And this is all because I put something out there. I tried to create an opportunity, I didn’t know where it was gonna take me, but I knew that I needed to put something out there and create my own opportunities, and then I was able to get Mugo into Walmarts and Urban Outfitters and, and retail, but I, I learned a lot from that. I’m no longer doing Mugo, but I think that opportunity taught me a lot of lessons about the business side of design and it took a lot, um, less off the creative side, so when I’m going into meetings with clients, I can talk about the business side, which I learned through Mugo. Like, what is your go-to market strategy? How, you know, what is your, um, what are your costs? Um, what is your distribution channels? You know, you ask these questions and I never would have been informed and knew how to ask, because I was a designer, I was more talking about the right font and the colors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:09:04&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: But I think if you talk uh business on a strategic level and you bring value to um, the relationship, then that’s when, uh, they’re more intrigued and uh, see you as a valued partner as opposed to just as a designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And that’s when my business really started to grow, is when I changed the dialogue from “design” to “business strategy.” And I think that’s a big part of why my business sort of took another step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, I’m gonna make a note to follow up on this, but I found “Ol’ Boy Blues.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s right here on the screen. It’s ‘cause I was typing “old,” I didn’t know it was “Ol’ Boy Blues.” So this is what it looks like. I remember you working on this. And this reminded me to kind of ask you this question about mock-ups and things like that, because some people in our pro-group, I, I told them you’re gonna be on the show and they said, “Ask him about how he does such a great job with his mock-ups and Behance.” Are there any tips that you can share with us? How much labor is put into these photographs that we are seeing here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:10:00&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Well, we’re not photographers so we just, we just do the best we can. We just try to figure it out, and I think that’s the, that’s the whole key to these things. It’s just, you figure it out. Just, just go into it, not necess–you don’t have to know the outcome. You just have to be willing to take that first step. Um, so this, we, we–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Now take for example this image here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Is this a stock photo that you comp’d the thing onto the brick wall?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No, we actually, there was, this is one of the alleyways behind, uh, one of our office, our office in Pasadena, and we, we shot this, with the, with the SLR camera and then we actually photoshopped uh the graphics onto the brick wall there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Who’s the guy wearing the vest carrying the crate and the bicycle?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: He was an employee at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh! Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And uh, so yeah. He modeled for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. And he had a vest and an old straw hat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That’s his style.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. What restaurant are we photographing this in?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, so we’re like: We need to get that contextual shot, and so we actually went into uh, uh, a burger place, and we said, uh, “We’re doing a student project. Would you mind if we shot some photos?” And they said, “No problem.” So we ordered some food and we took some snapshots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, I remember at this time, you barely even knew how to use the camera, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I was terrible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I remember ‘cause you were asking me questions–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I still don’t know how to use the camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, well that’s fine. But you knew enough now on how to take a shot that’s kind of lit well and kind of understand lighting. And it’s a key part to you being able to do such great mock-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, for us it’s a lot about storytelling, so it’s like we wanted to tell the story, the brand story, contextualize it and, and so that was, that was circa–there might be a date on there–circa 2012, maybe? 13?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Something like that. That’s okay. And then I want to look at your portfolio now on Farm, Farm Design on Behance. You get a lot of leads on, from Behance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: We get a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You get a lot. And so I want to talk about this for a brief moment ‘cause I’ve been harping on this to our audience. And they’re like: “Chris, I can’t get any work!” And I said, “Are you on Behance? What does it look like? And how much effort and energy did you put into those things?” So, I’m gonna step onto this one since it’s the newest one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: This “Ciderworks” thing here. Let’s take a look at it. Go ahead and talk us through this thing. What are you doing here?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: This is a project that we just launched yesterday. It’s called “Bivouac.” It’s a cider company in San Diego, California, they came to us maybe a year and a half ago because they saw some logos that we put on Behance that also was just a hypothetical project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Which one was that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That was, um, uh “Rust Coffee.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Rust Coffee, okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You guys look–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So we, we put…you know, so they found us on Behance, uh, they contacted us and we started–uh, they do cider. They wanted to do canned cider. They wanted to have a restaurant, um, sort of a, uh, uh, a watering hole for their clients or consumers, and, this is a year and a half process. And so when we put this together, it’s, it’s a combination of uh, telling a story, telling a brand story and hitting a lot of sort of the different facets of the brand, um, we try to look at sort of micro and macro sort of stories. A lot of what you see here are (those cans and boxes), those are mock-ups. So, whether we do a uh 3-D model, um or we use stock photography sites–uh, those I think we got from um, yellowimages.com, they do all these really great, sort of mock-ups with lighting, and so um we buy those off of there. And a lot of these other ones, like, when we look at stock photography, like you here, you have here with the guy holding the, the beer bottle, his…finding the right stock photography that doesn’t look like stock photography, that also aligns with the vision of the brand, so, it’s not just like pulling a photo and dropping it in there. It’s like you have to really curate and think about how that story works. Is it the right demographic? Does it have the right lighting and the tonality? Um, that one there, we loved to use stocksy.com is a really great sort of stock photo site. They don’t feel stock. We also use Shutterstock, um, dot com, but Shutterstock typically is, is good for, um, more sort of pedestrian-looking images. They do look kind of stock. But it’s a combination of mocking things up, shooting things, shooting them in-studio, um, shooting them out-of-studio…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well here’s what I wanna do: I want to break this thing down. And I’m gonna prep you for this in case you don’t want to do it. But, I’m gonna ask you a little bit about the business part of this thing, but not just yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Let’s talk about these cans. Is this CG? Computer generated? Or is this photographed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Can you tell me? What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I think it’s CG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: How can you tell?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: ‘Cause I know you don’t know how to photograph cans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay. You are correct. It is, it is a mock-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Hold on! I’m sorry for that!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It is a mock-up. But, I think–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It’s beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think some of the best, um, interpretations of branding are mock-ups. I don’t think it has to be a photograph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: No apologies. No apologies, dude. I don’t care. I think it looks great! I, I’m only guessing because I-you said, “I still don’t know how to take photos.” And to take a can sweating like this, it’s not that easy to do, and I look at the gradations a lot. You used that yellow? What, what?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yellow Images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yellow Images for this. How much did it cost you to buy the model for this and put uh, put your label on it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: A dollar fifty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Two hundred and fifty dollars, okay. A dollar fifty, you guys!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: A dollar fifty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: A dollar fifty. So that’s like–thanks for sharing this. Now, I, I just want to take a moment and say this to you guys that are out there: Aaron could have hoarded these resources. He could have said, “You guys just figure it out.” Because if you guys go look for 3-D mock-ups, you might spend quite a bit of time, trial and error, in finding the right vendors. So I really appreciate you saying that, and I’ve not heard of “Stocksy” before, and we’ll talk a little bit more about that. So he’s sharing his resources–he’s basically saying: “You guys, go out there and make better comps.” And, and I’m not, I’m not gonna feel the competition from you right now.” Let’s keep going on here. Why did you put this kind of “mountain-scape” behind it? Tell me about the thinking behind that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:15:55&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Sure. Well, Farm Design is a branding agency, so, we are trying to attract clients and build brand systems for them. So it’s not just a logo, it’s not just a website. We like to build systems. In order to build a, uh, a brand system that is effective and can connect and communicate with their audience, you have to have many different facets to it. And so, there’s a lot of sort of tertiary, um, secondary and tertiary sort of, um, artifacts (is what we like to call them), so, a primary artifact can be a logo. And if you scroll down a little bit farther, you know, you also have secondary marks, colors, textures…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Hold on. Lemme, let me drive this a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Tell me about the mountain though. So are you, where does this label go? Is this for an ad? Or you just added this for you, for the presentation of it? Did they actually use this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: They did. Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That one was actually born from one of the moodboards we created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And we actually used that uh, “texture,” if you will–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, uh, sort of kind of a misty, uh, ethereal background, um, to capture the essence of this adventure and outdoor lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C] Yeah, it’s just a cold mountain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I want my beverages to be cold, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, this restaurant photo: Is this their actual place? Their business?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: This is their actual place. It just literally opened up 2 days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I see. So this is fresh off the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Where is this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: So you drove down to San Diego and you took this photo?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It was given to us and we’re actually going to go there and shoot it with, uh, consu–our, uh, consumers in the space, ‘cause I think it brings a different dynamic. So even though we posted it now, we’re going to constantly update this to sort of enhance and improve it so we want to reshoot these and, and bring a different energy to it with having people in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:17:41&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Why is it important for you to constantly improve and revisit these presentations you have on Behance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Because I know that there are clients out there that are constantly looking at us. Not only today, you know, next month, a year from now, so, why not? We have the opportunity. This is, this is dynamic information. It’s not static. It’s like, once you put it up there, it doesn’t have to–it’s not permanent. It’s not like we’re printing something, an you have to burn it and reprint it. It’s, it’s so easy just to repopulate it and, on this forum, and because clients down the road, they’re gonna see it, and they’re gonna want. And they’re gonna see those details and the nuances, so we’re always trying to improve our craft…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Constantly improving our craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:18:21&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright, I want to say this to you guys. There’s this concept from Jim Rohn’s book, “The 7 Strategies for Wealth and Happiness.” He talks about the minors and the majors, what you don’t want to do is mix up these 2 things. You don’t want to make a minor effort for a major result or a goal. And you also don’t want to make a major effort for a minor goal. When you’re talking about your lead-gen source, basically all your sales and marketing, in terms of inbound, is coming from Behance, so it behooves you to do the very best job, and I’ve seen him do this and assign teams to do this, they could spend days, if not weeks working on the layout, the typography, the color palette, the phrasing, the order, and revisit with photography, and that’s why your work stands out. There are a hundred thousand, maybe a couple million people on Behance. Well, why is it always that the best work rises to the top? It’s because they put the time and energy into it and you need to do the same. I, I want to go back and it’s getting close to us breaking for the show here, and I’m sure our livestream audience probably doesn’t want it to end, but it’s gonna end at some point, so I want to dissect this really quickly, just give me shorter answers as what slide you want to talk about. This is a deep-dive into his portfolio, his sales and marketing technique because of the work that we’re seeing here. “Embrace your adventure.” Did you guys write that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yes, we did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And so there’s a little typographic–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Brand voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And they can use that. I saw it on the can. And again, there’s another photo here. I’m assuming that’s stock photo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And then, this is another 3-D mock-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693827b0dbce3f_AaronAtchison_work2.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yes, again, Yellow Images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm. Really good. Look–look at that corrugated cardboard there! You guys, that’s lookin’ really slick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, I say, ‘cause when I look at portfolios and I can tell that it’s a mock-up, that, I–I say it’s revealing the man behind the curtain. I want to try to craft something that you can’t quite tell, like, “Hmm, is that real or not?” That’s the level of detail that we’re trying to get, so like how the light hits it, how the shadows reflect, all those little nuances, if you can make it where you don’t reveal the man behind the curtain, then I think, then it’s okay. Then we’re gonna post it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Are they giving you the 3-D model? Or you give them the artwork and they render it for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It, it’s actually really great because if you subscribe to a premium version on YellowImages.com, you can actually have them do a 3-D render for you. You just give them the drawings, and I think in 2 to 4 weeks, then they’ll give you something. But then they’ll use that as, uh, they’ll sell that on–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: The stock model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: As a stock model on there, ‘cause they’re just trying to build content as well, so for a small fee of 300 dollars a year…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: They’ll actually make custom renders for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: What’s the limitation and how many can you get done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I believe it’s just one angle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Oh, I mean in a year. Uh, you pay 300 dollars in a year–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Wow!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: If you were to hire a CG guy to do it–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: The’re gonna charge more than 300. This, I think–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: For sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think they’re in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well, whatever. Okay, so if you guys should be in a 3-D, mock-up rendering business, you are now just out of business. Okay, let’s keep going here. “Ride the winds of change.” Something you wrote…the feather…the same misty mountains…these coasters. Are these mock-ups?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It is a mock-up, and you can tell, like, we even put like a, like a, uh, water stain on the actual coaster, uh shadows and we, so we composited all that together with the background, um…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Photo-comping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah, the whole thing is, like, is a composite. And this entire project here, I would say we probably invested around 100 hours to sort of mock this up. ‘Cause this is maybe 2 people working on it for over a week?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That’s, that’s how important it is to us, because I know the investment of that time and effort–I have to pay these, my employees to do this!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, I understand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So it’s an investment, and we know that this is gonna beget the next project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right. And I’m gonna say something that is both a complement and an insult to you. You ready? I tell my team: “Guys, look at these mock-ups. This is the gold standard,” to my team. And, “We can do better than this because we’re better than them, aren’t we? Are you telling me we’re not as good as them?” So I, I kinda just throw it out there. So if you guys (my team) can’t make better mock-ups and layouts than this, you’re not worth that much to me. I don’t say it quite like that, but, you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:22:22&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Where is the insult?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: The insult’s: We’re better than this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I think anyone can be better than this, and, and I know that–and, and with that–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:22:31&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: It’s like, we’re all, we also know that we can be–get better at this game as well, and so, a year from now, we expect our portfolio and our mock-ups to be better…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: …than it is today. So, you never just settle on your laurels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I, I do want to say this: Your mock-up game is tight. So, you’re, you’re already at that kind of upper echelon. Are these your shoes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That is me, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I can recognize your foot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Wait, that was also a composite because the, the…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Sure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: …photo wasn’t great, and so we composited things together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: A lot of color-correction, shadows, reflections, uhhh beer stains. All that–err–water stains. So this is, so you guys know when, when they say that they’re a branding agency, they truly are ‘cause they’re writing copy, they, they’re working on a lot more touch points than just the mark itself or just one package. They’re trying to create the entire kind of visual reflection of what this brand is all about. Okay, so I think you did a great job there of explaining all that stuff, of course, this is the sort of stuff we see in a lot of sites, and you like to do these multiple logos (that you call them “brand artifacts”), I think that’s, that’s the thing that you like to, to do for your clients. This is a stock photo, I’m pretty sure of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:23:32&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: This guy’s throwing hops, or whatever he’s doing right here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:23:34&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. Great. Good job, man! And I, I do want to say this to both designers and clients who are potentially watching this episode, is that: There are a lot of really great images out there. Maybe too many. And the problem is the ability to hone and find just the right image. So the image might not cost you very much in terms of payment, like, to buy an image off Shutterstock or Stocksy, it’s, it’s really pennies compared to what it would cost to commission somebody. What you are paying for is somebody with an eye who can curate this stuff and scan hundreds of–if not thousands–of images to find the one right fit for you. And that is a skill, and that is worth paying for. ‘Cause they’ve taken an asset that is a dollar and they’ve made it a hundred-thousand dollar image.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Because they’ve selected the right one, they might have gone and color-corrected it and adjusted some things so it becomes something that–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Absolutely. Those details, the curation is so important. And, it’s like, you can tell pretty quickly if that’s a stock photographer–photograph, or a mock-up. We try to, sort of, increase that perception of what that is and be able to tell a story. So your focusing on the story. And I think if you do it really well, I think that’s, that’s what we’re trying to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:24:44&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. I want to talk a little bit about business now. Could we talk some business?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright. How much did you get paid for that project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: The Bivouac?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: That was an interesting one because it was, uh, I actually got stock options in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Woohoo! Excuse me! It’s the dinger on that! There we go. Alright.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Oh my God. Did you really…?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah, I did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Nah, um. So I’m actually, uh, part owner, but very small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Very, very small. But if this thing gets sold to Budweiser, you know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You’ll, you’ll, you’ll combine that with–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Um, but in lieu of, uh, in terms of cash, it was, um, I think it was 45 thousand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Whoof!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: 45 thousand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Good for you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So it was in 3 payments, uh, spread out over a year and a half but, um, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Excellent. And when you told the client–we’ll talk about some of the mindset stuff here–here, let me put this down, uhh, 45 thousand dollars, we always have these kind of fears, like, “Uhh, is it too much? Is it too little?” Tell me about your mindset when you’re like working on the estimate for this thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:25:49&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay, so, the, the individual who contacted us actually was already engaged with, with another agency down in San Diego, an agency that (when I was in school, over 20 years ago), I looked up to. I would buy books because their logos were in it, and–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I know who you’re talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: They were, they were, they’re amazing. They’re still amazing. And when I heard that he’s working with them, I’m like: “Okay, we’re kind of not in your league, or the league that you’re looking for.” But he said, “I saw the ‘Rust’ project,” (and you can–) it’s on our Behance page it’s–and that was a hypothetical project. He said, “I just love what you guys do, there’s something about that.” And so, he wanted us to put a proposal together. I, I knew the agency that he was already engaged with, but that he was having, um, concerns with. And, so I, I took a risk, like, I’m gonna go bid higher out of my comfort zone because you’re always pushing us and, and on the ph–when we chat, we have our tea time and you’re always saying: “Ask for more! Why are you ask–you can, you can ask! Like okay, this is this one time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay, okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: This is this one time I think I’m gonna listen to Chris again. I’m gonna try to go out of my comfort zone, because probably my comfort zone is…far less. And so I put that proposal together, and my number (I said it was 45) I found out that the other agency, I think, was 120 thousand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So I was woefu–I was like woefully less than them, but I was con–incredibly content with what I got.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:27:25&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: But could I, could I have asked for more? But, it’s like, you know, you’re always sort of trying to figure out what your comfort level is, and what your value you bring to the project, and you, you’re always assessing if the client can afford you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Right. I, I want to talk about this for a brief minute. ‘Cause there are not many people who are on this show, who know me as well as you do. We’ve had thousands of hours of talking–sometimes personal, sometimes business–uh, in the last 20 years that we’ve known each other. I just want to give you guys an opportunity here, for you to totally mock me right now. When I’m talking to you and I’m like, “Aaron, blah blah blah.” You can par–you can, you can do your parody of what you think you hear when I say these things. I would love to hear you say that, for our audience, for our fans, I think they’re gonna like it. What do you hear? Like when I’m barking these things at you, what do you hear? How does this sound like in your brain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;@1:28:16&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I mean…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You ready?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Oh my gosh…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You–do your close-up! Right there!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Oh my gosh!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Tell the people how it sounds in your brain. I’ll get out of your shot, go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:28:23&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Well, I mean, when we first started, we were kind of like enemies because we were like–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: We’re not enemies!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No, we were! We started out as enemies! Like, I just wanted to crush you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I never saw it like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: And then&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It was easy to crush you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: You know, I always admired what you’ve been able to accomplish and build before even before you started The Futur, and it, it was really impressive, but I think a lot of my pride and stubbornness is like, I, I don’t want to listen to someone who is “up here.” I, I probably would listen to my parents, but I didn’t want to listen to you. And so it, for you it was just like, I, I can figure it out. I’m gonna do it my own way. And, I had to sort of realize that you’re giving me like really sound advice. So, it’s hard for me to, to parody you, but I just…I had to break down walls and sort of let you (like I, I, you’re younger than me, but I consider you like my “wise uncle”). I don’t know if that’s an insult, but no! You, you provide so much knowledge, whether it’s right or not, it’s like I, I, I start to filter it, and I start to slowly let it creep in. So it’s a–it’s been a slow burn, but I, I think I’m, I’m more open to, uh, listening to you because I think you provide, like, great content for your, your audience and I think, I think they see incredible value. So I, as, as much as you want me to mock you, I’m gonna thank you. Can I, can I just pivot? Can I just–can we do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You can do whatever you want, man. I was trying to give you your opportunity to blast it out of the universe!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: No, I, I’m–that’s not, that’s not my personality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: How are you not gonna mock me because other people have and they’ve done a fantastic job, so here’s what I heard (uhh, Aaron used these words): “Enemy, creep, and burn.” So, you can put those things together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Yeah. It’s all good. It’s all good. We have a great relationship, you guys. Okay, umm, Erica, Emmanuel, and Sam: Do you guys have any last thoughts before I close out on the deck, you guys?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Emmanuel]: Umm, I have a question from Aina San: “Umm, what do you do when you’re professional opinion or own project differs from what client wants? And he can’t be convinced?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Did you hear what he said?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Nah, I didn’t hear…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Basically, what do you do when your clients start to take aw–the project away from what it’s supposed to be? How do you respond to that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:30:37&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: God, that’s a great question. We’re, we’re challenged with this all the time. All the time. Uh, I think at the end of the day, ultimately they are the client, and they hired you to provide them a service. The best that we can do is we can, we can shepherd the process the best we can. We also know that we probably know more than them on a branding standpoint. So the best we can do is we can say, “Our professional advice is that, we would urge you to do this.” Ulti–ultimately at the end of the day, they’re gonna do what they’re gonna do. And that’s the way it, it’s gonna be. Um, so you’ve got to pick your battles, um, but you try to do what is best for the client, and, but at some point you gotta, you gotta just let them do what they’re gonna do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: I, I hope that answered the question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: It, it’s your answer. That’s good enough for me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Yeah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Alright, guys. I want to thank you for coming on the show. Aaron, before we say goodbye, I want to look at some of your work and talk a little bit about your journey, and I’m gonna send this out. Alright? With some music, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Can, can I say–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: You can say whatever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A] That when we talk about my journey, it’s like I, I wanna give a shout out to the people that aren’t here in the studio, and that’s all my employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Past and present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: ‘Cause yeah. Because they help shape who I am and they help shape the business, and so this output is a collective, uh, a collective group of really talented and young individuals. Um, so I just don’t, I want to make sure everyone knows that this is not me, this is a collection of like I think really like-minded, um, individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Well, I can’t leave you there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: I, I can’t. When you say, “This is not me,” I, I see a man transformed from the guy who’s like, “I, I can’t even hire an intern to cut things for me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: From 10 years ago whenever that was in 2000-ish. Somewhere in 2005, to now, 13 years later. What has happened to that man? What happened to Peter Pan?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:32:37&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: You know, I realized that in order to grow, that you have to accept that you don’t know everything. And so, I, I, I think I was very humbled when I sort of hit rock bottom, um, and I sort of reassessed who I am and who I wanted to be, so for me, I want to do things that are greater than myself, and do things that are fulfilling, and I think one of the greatest things that, um, I’ve learned and that is fulfilling to me, is helping others become better people as well, so, I–for me, it’s no longer working. The work doesn’t–it’s not, I’m not doing it for myself, I’m doing it to support and nurture my staff, and my clients, and I think that is the biggest reward. It’s not a monetary thing, um, it’s not re–awards on the wall, it’s really like, seeing individuals that I work with, and clients that I work with, succeeding in life, and, there’s a couple of designers and my, my staff, they actually are taking things that they learn from me, and then they are mentoring students now, so they are volunteering their time on weekends, and they created their own program, and they’re sharing information that they learned from me, so there’s–that is, that is pretty powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:33:51&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: So I just wanna like keep empowering people to empower people and, and to be in that situation–I wasn’t in that situation when I was a solopreneur. I was just focusing on me. Now I’m focusing on something beyond me, so when I say this isn’t just me, I, I’m trying to lead a team, and I just, you know, they’re the ones that are sort of helping with the vision, and sort of guiding this path that we’re all going down. It’s not–I’m, I’m just trying to like, pave the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Mm, mm. Okay, so here’s what I’m hearing from you. Is that when you’re working by yourself as a solopreneur, it becomes, kind of like this echo-chamber and (I hate to say it like this, but) it was very ego-centric&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Very much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And it was about all “me, me, me, me.” It’s like, “Marsha, Marsha, Marsha,” and that’s what it became. And what I’m hearing from you now is that (if, if I read this correctly), it’s that now you take great pride, not in the work that you do, but in terms of how you’re transforming other people’s lives, so when your team grows, and they do great work, you can take pride in that that you were able to create space or guidance or mentorship, or just helping them define the right clients, to get to that place. And then you also couple it off with, “It wasn’t about I wanted to do from a design point of view (which is self-centered and selfish), it was about trying to help your clients also have that same kind of success. So you can’t have a successful business without being a different kind of person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Everybody wants to be successful, so few people are willing to do the work that’s needed to change, and, and to me, that’s what you’ve been able to do. You’ve taken everything that I think is uh, an accumulation of your experiences and biases, and you’ve gone against that. You’ve let go of so many things. And that’s what has been, I think, the key to your transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Uh, uh, I think that’s pretty accurate. I think it’s, it’s getting out of your comfort zone and challenging yourself, and I think that’s when you grow as an individual. And then, learning from that and you challenge people around you to help them grow, so, getting out of that comfort zone, I think is a big part of growth. In order to get out of your comfort zone, you have to be able to accept the fact that you don’t know everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Okay. So let’s look at a couple, few, last slides and we’re gonna close up the show, or close out the show. Here’s some more things. Of course, you guys can go to Behance and look up Farm Design. There’s a couple of Farm designs there, but you’ll recognize the work and then you can look the rest of his portfolio, and I believe Aaron is relaunching the site on Thursday-ish, so if you go to FarmDesign.net–&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Mm-hmm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: –You’ll be able to see the freshly minted site. And this is really wonderful, beautiful work. It’s got really great attention to detail, patterns and textures and color palettes, and I, I truly appreciate and love all the contextual applications that you provide. So seeing it in context makes it feel so real and so rich. I don’t mean in terms of price, but it’s just a feast for the eyes and I think that’s what you guys want to do. And you see this diversity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;@1:36:44&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: Now, I look at this little boy, who loved basketball and you’re, you’re an athletic dude, and I see like what you’ve become, as the boy from, from Montana, to the, to the man who’s like running in Spartan races and you’re pretty hardcore. And, and you’re super competitive. So competitive I, I’m like, you just, you leave me in the dust. You keep doing these things. Okay, I’m just trying to limp across the finish line myself. And, you, you were a guy who was afraid of commitment, afraid of being out in the public, to speaking at TED (a HUGE accomplishment there), kudos to you, and, making the ultimate commitment, and getting married. And before anybody starts to cry, we’re gonna end the show on that. Okay? You guys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: End it quickly!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C] Yeah. Okay, so I’m gonna–Ey! Let’s cut back to me! Aaron, thanks for coming on the show, dude! I know this is a big moment for both of us because there was a lot of fear, questions, concerns, and all that kind of stuff about what’s it entail, and I’m so appreciative that you’ve been so transparent and sharing of all the highs and the lows. I was a little shocked that you were able to talk about the money. I wasn’t sure if you’d go there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[A]: Me, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[C]: And, you just let it go, baby! It’s all out there! So guys, um, we don’t, I don’t have, um, an applause track, but thank you very much. I’m gonna close out this show. Let’s cut this thing. Let’s, let’s do…let’s try this music. This sounds appropriate, I think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content>

    <title>How to Get More Clients</title>
    <updated>2018-03-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2018-03-29:/blog/how-to-get-more-clients</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get tired of fielding questions around how to get more clients, so I’ve decided to write an article on things you need to do right now before going online and asking, “Help. How do I get more clients?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you go hire a business coach or sales person, enroll in an online course, follow a get rich quick scheme, do this first. Warning, this is a long list of things to do. No easy answers, no quick fixes, but the bare minimum of what you need to do before looking for more help. Remember, people hire who they know, who they like and who they trust. So time to get known. #GetKnown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Build a website.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;State what you do clearly, then back it up with great examples. Show me. Don’t tell me. Make sure the site is responsive, avoid anything that will slow down or impair the ability for someone to navigate your site. This includes: Cinemagraphs, parallax effects, tricky animation or unconventional interfaces. A simple hamburger menu with the following will work: work, about, contact. Use a legible and neutral typeface. Limit the number of colors you use. Have a simple logo. If you don’t have one, just typeset your name in Helvetica Bold using upper/lower case. Make your site SEO friendly. Name the images on your site with descriptive names. “Untitled” or “Final_final_03” doesn’t count as being descriptive. Instead, try “Los-Angles-Design-Branding-Anime-Expo”. Basically, help Google classify the images so that if someone is searching for you, they can find you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Update your LinkedIn profile.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with having a professionally shot photo. Keep it simple (white, grey or black backdrop). It’s worth the investment since you’ll be able to use this elsewhere. Ask yourself, would I hire me based on this photo? Would I dive deeper into this persons’ profile? Do they appear professional, credible and friendly? Is this someone I can trust with my money? Is this someone I can see myself being around for a long period of time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write a captivating headline instead of a job title. Focus on a user/customer benefit vs describing what you do. What do you do for them? An example could be “I help small brands look like big brands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update your education, work history, awards and accolades. Get a few, well written, but sincere testimonials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Get on Behance.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have 3-5 in-depth case studies of outstanding work. Make sure they’re labeled and tagged appropriately to make sure others can find you. Keep the photography or mock-ups simple to make your work shine. Where appropriate, document the creative process. Put the time and energy into designing every component so that it looks as attractive (and expensive) as possible. Look at your work through the lens of a prospective client. Would this excite them? Could they envision working with you through the work that you presented? Is the thinking clear? Are you focused on craftsmanship and detail? Is your typography excellent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure about the impact of Behance on your sales leads? &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/zwcOx5gXpzk&#34;&gt;Watch this video&lt;/a&gt; with Farm Design Founder Aaron Atchison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938419cdbce4c_reinvent-yourself-farm_preview.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Ask for referrals.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reach out to current and past clients and ask them for a referral. Tell them that you’re growing your business and have additional capacity to take on more work, that you’d appreciate any referrals or recommendations to anyone that could use your services. If they know someone, offer to contact them directly vs. leaving it in their hands to follow through. People are busy after all and you don’t want to add any additional work on their plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would you say this? One, it’s fun to share exciting news. Two, they won’t worry about sharing you since you are growing your team. Some clients actually do worry that you won’t be available any more, or that you’ll become more expensive as a result. You can address by saying that, “Yes, our rates are going up, but I appreciate your business and loyalty. I will do my best to work within your budget moving forward and will give you preferential pricing.” Lastly, people don’t always think to refer you. It’s just not top of mind. So if you want something, you have to be willing to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. It’s old fashioned, but have a business card and use as a tool to engage with others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;Keep it simple and tasteful. Make sure you say what you do and that your contact info is legible. Other than that, avoid using additional photography, illustration of artwork on your card. It’s a name card and not a billboard. Use 1-2 typefaces (max). One or two colors on a sturdy card stock is sufficient. Don’t spend more than a dollar per card. You’re better off stamping your name and contact info on a dollar bill and hand those out instead. When you are at social functions and have an opportunity to meet a prospective client, don’t give them your card. Instead, ask for theirs. Say, “I’d love to follow up with you after this event. Do you have a card?” When they give your their card, hand them yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s more important to get their contact info than to give them yours. This way, you can follow up vs. waiting by the phone or inbox for them to reach out. The next business day, follow up by connecting with them on LinkedIn. Add a short note reminding them of who you are. Keep it short and simple. Close the note by inviting further dialogue if there’s interest. You could close with something like, “If you would like to continue our dialogue about rebranding your company, I would love to help. Please let me know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Join communities and organizations.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be active in both social groups (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/FuturFans/&#34;&gt;Facebook &lt;/a&gt;and LinkedIn) and trade organizations. Chances are, there’s a professional organization within a few miles of where you are located (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aiga.org/&#34;&gt;AIGA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rgd.ca/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RGD&lt;/a&gt; (In Canada), Entrepreneurs’ Organization, Meet up groups, etc…). Build relationship with people without trying to sell. Find out more about who they are, goals and challenges. The people that you form a genuine relationship will become your best resource for leads, people and resources. This is a long term activity that will not appear to be helpful or productive in the short term. If it’s online, post relevant articles. If it’s in person, volunteer to help. You can do simple things like set-up or clean up an event. You can help find speakers or be one yourself. Whatever you do, make an investment in the community to which you belong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some others you can join: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/FuturOfWork/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Futur Network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/FuturFeedback/learning_content/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Futur Feedback/Crit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/futur-pro-group&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Members&lt;/a&gt; ($150/mo.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Invest in a good interchangeable lens camera (ILC or DSLR) and start taking pictures.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take photos of everything you do, places you go and things you see. Why buy a camera? One, your eye will become much more aware of composition, color and lighting. Two, you’ll learn a new skill. Three, you’ll be motivated to visit new places and do exciting things. Four, you’ll start to learn the value of having beautiful photography and how powerful a single image can be. Five, your social media posts will look much more interesting.

Apply your skillset to help someone you admire. Reach out to them and offer to help them with something specific that taps into your strengths. Getting access to someone that you really look up to can change the way you think, but it can also open doors for future opportunities. You never know where this will lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>How to Get More Clients</title>
    <updated>2018-03-29T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2018-03-29:/blog/how-to-get-more-clients</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I get tired of fielding questions around how to get more clients, so I’ve decided to write an article on things you need to do right now before going online and asking, “Help. How do I get more clients?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you go hire a business coach or sales person, enroll in an online course, follow a get rich quick scheme, do this first. Warning, this is a long list of things to do. No easy answers, no quick fixes, but the bare minimum of what you need to do before looking for more help. Remember, people hire who they know, who they like and who they trust. So time to get known. #GetKnown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Build a website.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;State what you do clearly, then back it up with great examples. Show me. Don’t tell me. Make sure the site is responsive, avoid anything that will slow down or impair the ability for someone to navigate your site. This includes: Cinemagraphs, parallax effects, tricky animation or unconventional interfaces. A simple hamburger menu with the following will work: work, about, contact. Use a legible and neutral typeface. Limit the number of colors you use. Have a simple logo. If you don’t have one, just typeset your name in Helvetica Bold using upper/lower case. Make your site SEO friendly. Name the images on your site with descriptive names. “Untitled” or “Final_final_03” doesn’t count as being descriptive. Instead, try “Los-Angles-Design-Branding-Anime-Expo”. Basically, help Google classify the images so that if someone is searching for you, they can find you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Update your LinkedIn profile.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with having a professionally shot photo. Keep it simple (white, grey or black backdrop). It’s worth the investment since you’ll be able to use this elsewhere. Ask yourself, would I hire me based on this photo? Would I dive deeper into this persons’ profile? Do they appear professional, credible and friendly? Is this someone I can trust with my money? Is this someone I can see myself being around for a long period of time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write a captivating headline instead of a job title. Focus on a user/customer benefit vs describing what you do. What do you do for them? An example could be “I help small brands look like big brands.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update your education, work history, awards and accolades. Get a few, well written, but sincere testimonials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Get on Behance.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have 3-5 in-depth case studies of outstanding work. Make sure they’re labeled and tagged appropriately to make sure others can find you. Keep the photography or mock-ups simple to make your work shine. Where appropriate, document the creative process. Put the time and energy into designing every component so that it looks as attractive (and expensive) as possible. Look at your work through the lens of a prospective client. Would this excite them? Could they envision working with you through the work that you presented? Is the thinking clear? Are you focused on craftsmanship and detail? Is your typography excellent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure about the impact of Behance on your sales leads? &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/zwcOx5gXpzk&#34;&gt;Watch this video&lt;/a&gt; with Farm Design Founder Aaron Atchison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938419cdbce4c_reinvent-yourself-farm_preview.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Ask for referrals.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reach out to current and past clients and ask them for a referral. Tell them that you’re growing your business and have additional capacity to take on more work, that you’d appreciate any referrals or recommendations to anyone that could use your services. If they know someone, offer to contact them directly vs. leaving it in their hands to follow through. People are busy after all and you don’t want to add any additional work on their plate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would you say this? One, it’s fun to share exciting news. Two, they won’t worry about sharing you since you are growing your team. Some clients actually do worry that you won’t be available any more, or that you’ll become more expensive as a result. You can address by saying that, “Yes, our rates are going up, but I appreciate your business and loyalty. I will do my best to work within your budget moving forward and will give you preferential pricing.” Lastly, people don’t always think to refer you. It’s just not top of mind. So if you want something, you have to be willing to ask for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. It’s old fashioned, but have a business card and use as a tool to engage with others.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;Keep it simple and tasteful. Make sure you say what you do and that your contact info is legible. Other than that, avoid using additional photography, illustration of artwork on your card. It’s a name card and not a billboard. Use 1-2 typefaces (max). One or two colors on a sturdy card stock is sufficient. Don’t spend more than a dollar per card. You’re better off stamping your name and contact info on a dollar bill and hand those out instead. When you are at social functions and have an opportunity to meet a prospective client, don’t give them your card. Instead, ask for theirs. Say, “I’d love to follow up with you after this event. Do you have a card?” When they give your their card, hand them yours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s more important to get their contact info than to give them yours. This way, you can follow up vs. waiting by the phone or inbox for them to reach out. The next business day, follow up by connecting with them on LinkedIn. Add a short note reminding them of who you are. Keep it short and simple. Close the note by inviting further dialogue if there’s interest. You could close with something like, “If you would like to continue our dialogue about rebranding your company, I would love to help. Please let me know.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Join communities and organizations.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be active in both social groups (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/FuturFans/&#34;&gt;Facebook &lt;/a&gt;and LinkedIn) and trade organizations. Chances are, there’s a professional organization within a few miles of where you are located (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aiga.org/&#34;&gt;AIGA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rgd.ca/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RGD&lt;/a&gt; (In Canada), Entrepreneurs’ Organization, Meet up groups, etc…). Build relationship with people without trying to sell. Find out more about who they are, goals and challenges. The people that you form a genuine relationship will become your best resource for leads, people and resources. This is a long term activity that will not appear to be helpful or productive in the short term. If it’s online, post relevant articles. If it’s in person, volunteer to help. You can do simple things like set-up or clean up an event. You can help find speakers or be one yourself. Whatever you do, make an investment in the community to which you belong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some others you can join: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/FuturOfWork/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Futur Network&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.facebook.com/groups/FuturFeedback/learning_content/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Futur Feedback/Crit&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/futur-pro-group&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Futur Pro Members&lt;/a&gt; ($150/mo.).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Invest in a good interchangeable lens camera (ILC or DSLR) and start taking pictures.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take photos of everything you do, places you go and things you see. Why buy a camera? One, your eye will become much more aware of composition, color and lighting. Two, you’ll learn a new skill. Three, you’ll be motivated to visit new places and do exciting things. Four, you’ll start to learn the value of having beautiful photography and how powerful a single image can be. Five, your social media posts will look much more interesting.

Apply your skillset to help someone you admire. Reach out to them and offer to help them with something specific that taps into your strengths. Getting access to someone that you really look up to can change the way you think, but it can also open doors for future opportunities.

Shunning uniformity, 42 international artists with the most sought-after works contributed to create a guide to the aged technique accompanying our contemporary culture, and top it off with an exclusive step-by-step guide on how to perfect the craft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938fb6cdbce55_P1060254-300x169.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385b92dbce58_P1060255-300x169.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938247fdbce52_P1060256-300x169.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693833dedbce59_P1060257-300x169.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693871b0dbce5a_P1060258-300x169.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938121fdbce53_P1060259-300x169.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938b9b5dbce54_P1060260-300x169.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693824f9dbce56_P1060261-300x169.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269386cf4dbce57_P1060262-300x169.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938861ddbce5c_P1060263-300x169.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381e17dbce5b_P1060264-300x169.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>Learn Typography Fundamentals</title>
    <updated>2017-09-28T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;It’s mysterious, even intimidating for some. &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn’t an experience that I’ve imagined. It’s one that I’ve gone through personally. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a young student studying graphic design at &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.artcenter.edu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ArtCenter College of Design&lt;/a&gt;, I felt intimidated by the work that I saw in the student gallery. After all, this was some of the best, most progressive work that was on display. I remember walking by the gallery and thinking to myself, one day, I hope my work will be as good as the work that I saw.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you can relate. Maybe you’ve seen a few portfolios on Behance or Pinterest and thought the same thing. How is it that someone, who has access to the same tools, fonts and images as me, can do such incredible work? What’s the difference? How did they learn typography? What makes them so special and me less so? The answer came to me in the form of a petite, well dressed man with a British accent. His name was &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.simonjohnstondesign.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Simon Johnston&lt;/a&gt; and I was fortunate enough to have him as my Type I instructor. I didn’t know it then, but that class was about to fundamentally unlock the mysteries of design to me and my fellow classmates. I would actually learn how type works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first assignment he gave was perfectly designed. It taught us the principles of typography: legibility, alignment, contrast, spacing, scale, proportion and balance. I would later learn that the assignment that he gave us was the same one given at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thebaselschoolofdesign.ch/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Basel School of Design &lt;/a&gt;— founded by legendary designers Armin Hoffman and Emil Ruder. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I completed each week’s assignment, I felt my skill and confidence with type grow. It was an amazing feeling. I could now look at books that featured amazing designers, and feel that I knew the invisible principles at work. I could see the grid structure. I felt like Neo in the Matrix when he was first able to see the code that made up the virtual world. It was truly exhilarating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269386fc5dbce5f_17-DF-Typography-03.008.png&#34; alt=&#34;Learn Typography - Slide Preview&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that semester, I remembered returning to the student gallery and looked at the work again. My feeling had changed. Don’t get me wrong, the work was still amazing, but now, instead of wishing to do work as good as what I saw, &lt;strong&gt;I realized that great work was achievable&lt;/strong&gt;. In that moment, a quiet, introverted student, became a confident designer, eager to apply his knowledge to all kinds of design problems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learning about type and typography taught me about space and proportion, something that could be applied to virtually anything. I’ve used what I learned to design furniture (book shelves, desks, etc…), building facades, interior spaces and everything else that has a visual form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, years have passed, and I’m running a motion design studio. But the one thing that keeps coming up, with the influx of new designers to our shop, is that they lack some of the fundamentals of typography—they lacked the same knowledge that I got so many years ago. I would sit down with my designers, help them learn typography, and go over basic principles with them. At one point, I even conducted classes at our office to train our staff in typography. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After doing this for a few years, I got tired of saying the same thing over and over again as each new wave of designers came into our office. One night, I sat down and wrote a few key tips on typography. This document turned into the “Typography Manual,” which then turned into an animated video. Surprisingly, the video took off on Facebook garnering over 350k views and 10k shares. &lt;strong&gt;We touched a nerve.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269382579dbce61_17-DF-Typography-03.017.png&#34; alt=&#34;Learn Typography - Slide Preview&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started to get emails and messages telling me how they learned more about using type in that one document/video than every other source combined. Wow! That’s pretty cool. I got more messages asking for book recommendations and courses to take. Honestly, I didn’t know of such a resource. There were good books on the history of type, grid structure, but I didn’t know of a single resource that actually helped people learn typography the way I learned it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693866b0dbce60_17-DF-Typography-03.026.png&#34; alt=&#34;Learn Typography - Slide Preview&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269382be2dbce62_13-DF-Typography-01.101.png&#34; alt=&#34;Learn Typography - Slide Preview&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Designed by Matthew Benkert at Art Center College of Design&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938d0a6dbce63_15-DF-Typography-02.054.png&#34; alt=&#34;Learn Typography - Slide Preview&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;Designed by Josef Müller-Brockmann&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has led me to where we are today—the creation of the Design Fundamentals series. It’s a four part course on Typography (repetition and contrast, grid construction and application, typographic details and optical adjustments, and layout) with live work sessions (typography posters) where you actually get to see and hear us work through a design problem. I’ve combed through books, done the research, and applied everything that I’ve learned about typography in this one class. The Typography course answers these fundamental questions:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;What typeface should I use? Do you have recommendations?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is the Golden Ratio calculated?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What is the Fibonacci series and how do I use it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do I use grids in my layout?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What are book recommendations where I can learn more?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why are certain characters drawn that way? They look odd to me?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do I achieve optical balance in designing logos and letterforms?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do I mix typefaces?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;+ more&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a way, it’s my attempt to recreate the learning experience that I had at Art Center.

    <title>9 Lessons Every Freelancer Should Know</title>
    <updated>2017-08-07T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-08-07:/blog/lessons-every-freelancer-should-know</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people go into it thinking that they get to spend all of their time creating projects that they love, only to quickly realize that this is not the case. Not only do you have to be responsible for the quality of work that you produce, but you also have to now handle all of the not-so-fun nuances that keep a business running, such as accounting, sales, business development etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still am learning a lot every day and still have a lot to learn. While freelancing for these past 6 months, I wanted to share some insight on 9 lessons that every freelancer should know—in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 1: Be Yourself&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons is to be confident in who you are as a freelancer. Start developing a personal approach to your creative work, but make sure you stay clear of making the work be about you when you are hired. You should always add your personal touch to your work, and over time, when your work gets more notice, this will be the main reason clients want to hire you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to your personal work, you have to be open to telling your story because you are the only one who is able to do that. For example, I am a freelance web developer and digital marketer, but I was born with one hand and coined my nickname The One Hand Wonder Man. I tell my story in my blog posts which help me relate and connect with potential clients on a deeper level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to tell your story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 2: Learn to Say No&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before I dive into this lesson, just know that it is a lot easier said than done. Especially when bills need to get paid and your workload is looking extra light, it is very tempting to say yes to any project that comes your way—but don’t. Look out for the warning signs when speaking to a potential client. Are they punctual? Do they respect your time and not argue about your rates? Do they have a vision of what type of work that they want to be done, or are they all over the place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping these questions in mind will help you determine if this potential client is a good fit. Remember, when you accept a project you are potentially turning down a bigger one down the line, so you have to make sure that each project you take on is worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 3: Define Your Key Audience&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being able to target your audience is going to be really effective when pitching to get new work. If you are a designer who has a portfolio with a lot of work done around software companies, then it doesn’t make sense to spend your time pitching restaurants and coffee shops. Once you have a clear audience in mind, you’ll be able to more effectively lock down clients in your niche. I’m not saying you have to stay in this area forever, but you’ll notice more times than not when pitching potential clients, they want to see the work that you have done that can be beneficial for them and the experience that you have in their field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 4: Content is Always King &amp;amp; Queen&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cannot stress this enough. Especially being a web designer, you can create a beautiful website with nice elements and colors, but if there is no content or the content is lacking, then it defeats the purpose. Most of the time as a freelancer you have no control over the content that your client has, but this is where sometimes turning down work because you don’t want it to reflect poorly on your style comes in handy (see lesson 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When creating content for your own brand, of course, you should put emphasis on how it is presented to entice the reader, but the message of the piece is what is going to keep them hooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 5: Add Value&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most important lessons to learn is to always remember to add value to your clients. You aren’t selling your services. You are selling your value that you can bring to your client. There are hundreds, if not thousands, of people and companies that do what I do, but why do clients hire me? Because they can’t get the Max Pete experience from anywhere else in terms of efficiency, work ethic, and value that I bring to each client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will not only help attract and retain clients, but it will also make sure that you aren’t undervaluing yourself in terms of how much you’ll be making per project. Once you can effectively prove your value to a client, it is easier to stand firm on your pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn more about adding value, I strongly recommend watching this &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/RKXZ7t_RiOE&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;“How To Price Design Services”&lt;/a&gt; video by Chris Do and The Futur team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;LESSON 6: Building Relationships&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building relationships beyond just your clients is key to keep growing and expanding your brand. I am not too skilled when it comes to graphic design or photography, but I have people in my network that are who I refer to on an ongoing basis. I often get requests from clients that I can’t handle, but because I was able to build relationships with other creatives, I am able to send them work and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quote “Your Net Worth Is Your Network” is the truth. In order to be a successful freelancer, you have to get out and network with your fellow peers, even just reaching out to say you like a piece of work they did can lead to a long-lasting relationship. Also if you haven’t figured this out by now, the freelance life is pretty lonely. It is a lot better when you have an established network of peers that you can call on to get work done together and bounce ideas of each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 7: Never Stop Learning&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s very easy to keep your head down and to just focus on work, but don’t forget to keep learning. We live in a great time period where all we have to do is Google something to find the answer. Take full advantage of that. Want to get better at Photoshop? Start learning now. Want to learn more CSS for website development? Start learning now. Keep expanding your knowledge base and you’ll notice the positive effects that it has on you and your brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 8: Step Outside of Your Comfort Zone&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth does not happen inside your comfort zone. Yes, everything might seem fine and stable, but there is no growing and learning. You have to be okay with making mistakes and failing. It is all apart of the process and you’ll never know about it unless you step outside your own comfort zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the points of being a freelancer is to not live the mundane 9-5 office life. You have to learn to get out of a comfortable mindset and take risks. You never know what opportunity is waiting for you outside your own comfort zone until you start exploring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lesson 9: You&amp;#39;re Your Most Important Client&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might be the most important lesson of them all. One of my favorite pieces of advice I have received this year was “Spend an hour a day working on your own brand before working on any client work.” This really made me change how I start my days because I often used to find myself scrambling to get client work done before I took the time to work on my own brand which led me to put off certain tasks to help me grow and get my name out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I strongly recommend spending one hour in the morning tackling the things that you need to get done in order to grow your brand. It can be as simple as answering emails that you have been putting off, researching topics for new blogs posts, or starting to develop your own content marketing strategy. Don’t feel bad for putting yourself first.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Lessons Learned&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope all or at least some of these lessons help make you a better freelancer before you read them. Being a freelancer isn’t easy, and is always a work in progress. Don’t get too caught up if you aren’t where you want to be exactly in life today. Keep up the hard work, be consistent, build relationships and you’ll be on your way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guest Post by Max Pete&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Max Pete aka One Hand Wonder Man is a freelance website designer and digital marketer.

    <title>Meeting a Client: 4 Profiles to Identify</title>
    <updated>2017-07-26T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-07-26:/blog/meeting-client-first-time-profiles-identify</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every client is different, but most of them fall into one of four categories: Fishers, Square Peggers, Cost Conscious Clients, or Perfect Clients. Here are tips to help you identify the type of person you are dealing with in your client meetings, and hopefully, save you time and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938a4dcdbce6b_Blog-the-fisher-1024x683.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Fisher&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you scored a meeting with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thefutur.com/anatomy-first-meeting-part-one/&#34;&gt;potential new client&lt;/a&gt;. Great! They must be in the market for exactly what you do, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. If you’re dealing with a Fisher, there may or may not be a legitimate job available. Instead, you’re dealing with someone who is fishing for information. That’s not an inherently good or bad thing, and it usually doesn’t mean ill intent. What it does mean is that you’re in danger of wasting a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Fisher is often trying to figure out what they need to put a request for proposal(RFP) together for a project. It might just be that they’ve never done a digital project before. It could also be that they’re maliciously trying to figure out a baseline for your agency. Either way, it comes down to the same issue: they’re wasting your time without any real work available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Managing a Fisher&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calling card of a Fisher is that they don’t have any intent to buy. Ask questions about why they asked for a meeting – if you’re listening for it, you should be able to pick them out pretty quickly. Sometimes I’ll be very straight about it and ask “would you like me to send you an RFP template?” If they’re upfront in their answer, then I’ve just saved us both a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And time is really what it comes down to with a Fisher, and it’s why they’re such an important client type to recognize and understand. When meeting a client for the first time, you go in with the assumption that there’s work available. If you leave the meeting with the wrong first impression, you can pour hours into creating a proposal that just isn’t going to go anywhere. Creating a proposal and estimate takes time: it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see many young agencies wasting a lot of effort on “fishing expeditions.” Qualifying your clients is key to avoiding this. Like I said before, don’t be afraid to ask upfront questions about what the potential client needs. Offer to send them an RFP template or educate them in other ways that aren’t going to drain your time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing, understanding, and managing Fishers will save you time and effort in the long run. Though these clients generally aren’t malicious, they can be a major drain on your resources. Tread carefully when you meet a Fisher to make sure you have someone with actual work on your line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384664dbce6c_Blog-the-square-pegger-1024x683.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Square Pegger&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Fisher, the Square Pegger does have a legitimate job for you to do. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s going to be easier to deal with. Here’s what you need to know to identify and manage this type of client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Square Pegger is a client who isn’t the final decision maker, but they are responsible for getting something done. Due to this, they feel their job is on the line. They’re doing their due diligence, so they’re going to ask a lot of unusual questions that you might not normally run into in an initial client meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other clear sign of a Square Pegger is that they need specific examples of what they’re looking for. So, let’s say you have a Square Pegger who needs a mobile app developed. If you’ve never designed a mobile app, they’re not going to work with you. They want to see exactly what they’re buying at the outset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Managing The Square Pegger&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the least effective things you can do with a Square Pegger is send them a huge proposal right up front. Any time you put in here that isn’t directly related to what they want will be wasted. Make sure you edit your proposal so it is succinct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to keep in mind with this type of client is that they’re not the final decision maker. Something I like to do early on with any client is to determine what kind of partner they’re looking for. That way, if there are any issues we can’t overcome, I don’t end up wasting either of our time. But with a Square Pegger, you have to be aware of everyone else that’s going to be looking at the proposal too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before a Square Pegger gives you the sale, they’re going to have to share your proposal with their peers. So not only do you have to understand what the person you’re talking to wants in a partner, you’re also going to have to understand the people around them, AKA, “stakeholders.” What are the trigger points that would lead each person to purchase? What might their objections be? Understanding the organization as a whole will increase your chance of a sale with this type of client, or help you decide quickly that they’re not someone likely to buy from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you meet with a Square Pegger, understand that they’re looking for something specific that you may or may not be able to provide. I know I tend to bump into this client type quite a bit, so be on the lookout.  The sooner that you can show them precisely what they’re looking for, or the sooner you realize that the two of you aren’t a good match, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Cost Conscious Client&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Cost Conscious Client is someone who sees what you provide as a commodity. They feel the same way about what you do as they would about buying a chair or a loaf of bread. If someone else is charging a certain price for what you do, the Cost Conscious Client is going to expect the same from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the driving forces behind how this client makes decisions is past experience. Often, these clients have overpaid for something previously. This makes them overly cautious about scope and cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think you may have a Cost Conscious Client on your hands, don’t be afraid to ask about their previous projects and the typical budget. If they’ve been burned before, it will likely come out. You can use the information they provide to decide if they’re the type of client that would be a good match for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Perfect Client&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the client you want to work with! They’re familiar with the process and they’re ready to start right away. They value your skills and are respectful of what you do. Often this is because they have tried a cheaper option and found out the hard way that you truly do “get what you pay for.” Sometimes you will even find that they are willing to pay a premium for the quality services that you offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another calling card of the Perfect Client is that there is something driving their decision. There’s a reason they need the work done, and they can clearly articulate what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the Perfect Client is someone you want to work with. They show respect for what you do, they value what you can provide, and they communicate easily. All in all, they’re someone who is simply a pleasure to do business with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Growing the Perfect Client&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The perfect client isn’t just waiting out there for you to discover them. In many cases, the perfect client is created. By cultivating your clients and providing value and education, you can increase the number of perfect clients you encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t mean putting in a ton of work creating a proposal right up front. In many cases all this does is waste your time. But be generous in providing RFP templates, examples of other projects, and other materials for them to look at from the beginning. Be willing to guide your clients early on to help bring out their best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding what type of client you’re meeting with will help you quickly decide whether they’re someone you want to work with. Don’t be discouraged when you run into Fishers, Square Peggers, or Cost Conscious Clients. The Perfect Clients are out there, and in greater numbers than you may realize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article and its content was originally created by Chris Do.

    <title>Meeting a Client: 4 Profiles to Identify</title>
    <updated>2017-07-26T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every client is different, but most of them fall into one of four categories: Fishers, Square Peggers, Cost Conscious Clients, or Perfect Clients. Here are tips to help you identify the type of person you are dealing with in your client meetings, and hopefully, save you time and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938a4dcdbce6b_Blog-the-fisher-1024x683.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Fisher&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you scored a meeting with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thefutur.com/anatomy-first-meeting-part-one/&#34;&gt;potential new client&lt;/a&gt;. Great! They must be in the market for exactly what you do, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not necessarily. If you’re dealing with a Fisher, there may or may not be a legitimate job available. Instead, you’re dealing with someone who is fishing for information. That’s not an inherently good or bad thing, and it usually doesn’t mean ill intent. What it does mean is that you’re in danger of wasting a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Fisher is often trying to figure out what they need to put a request for proposal(RFP) together for a project. It might just be that they’ve never done a digital project before. It could also be that they’re maliciously trying to figure out a baseline for your agency. Either way, it comes down to the same issue: they’re wasting your time without any real work available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Managing a Fisher&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The calling card of a Fisher is that they don’t have any intent to buy. Ask questions about why they asked for a meeting – if you’re listening for it, you should be able to pick them out pretty quickly. Sometimes I’ll be very straight about it and ask “would you like me to send you an RFP template?” If they’re upfront in their answer, then I’ve just saved us both a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And time is really what it comes down to with a Fisher, and it’s why they’re such an important client type to recognize and understand. When meeting a client for the first time, you go in with the assumption that there’s work available. If you leave the meeting with the wrong first impression, you can pour hours into creating a proposal that just isn’t going to go anywhere. Creating a proposal and estimate takes time: it’s up to you to decide if it’s worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I see many young agencies wasting a lot of effort on “fishing expeditions.” Qualifying your clients is key to avoiding this. Like I said before, don’t be afraid to ask upfront questions about what the potential client needs. Offer to send them an RFP template or educate them in other ways that aren’t going to drain your time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognizing, understanding, and managing Fishers will save you time and effort in the long run. Though these clients generally aren’t malicious, they can be a major drain on your resources. Tread carefully when you meet a Fisher to make sure you have someone with actual work on your line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384664dbce6c_Blog-the-square-pegger-1024x683.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Square Pegger&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Fisher, the Square Pegger does have a legitimate job for you to do. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean he’s going to be easier to deal with. Here’s what you need to know to identify and manage this type of client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Square Pegger is a client who isn’t the final decision maker, but they are responsible for getting something done. Due to this, they feel their job is on the line. They’re doing their due diligence, so they’re going to ask a lot of unusual questions that you might not normally run into in an initial client meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other clear sign of a Square Pegger is that they need specific examples of what they’re looking for. So, let’s say you have a Square Pegger who needs a mobile app developed. If you’ve never designed a mobile app, they’re not going to work with you. They want to see exactly what they’re buying at the outset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Managing The Square Pegger&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the least effective things you can do with a Square Pegger is send them a huge proposal right up front.

    <title>The Anatomy of a First Meeting</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How you handle your first meetings has a lot to do with personal preference. However, there is a flow to most meetings that helps improve rapport and communication. Let&amp;#39;s dig into the first two points on my First Meeting Checklist: Connect and Align.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;T&lt;strong&gt;he First Step Of A First Meeting: Connect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Small talk: you either love it or you hate it. Whether you’re meeting in person, on the phone, or in any other situation, you’re going to spend a few minutes building rapport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it may seem a little frivolous at the outset, this period of connection plays an important role. Building rapport sets the groundwork for the rest of the meeting. It’s your chance to profile the person in a casual way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you start to connect with your meeting partner, ask questions that help you dig a little deeper into who they are and what they need. Where did they go to school? What are they educated in? What has their work experience been like? Do they have a family? This is all stuff you can use later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The connection stage of a meeting creates a tone that will carry you through the rest of the conversation. It may be tempting to rush right into the meat of the conversation, but don’t skip this step!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;T&lt;strong&gt;he Second Step Of A First Meeting: Align&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of this segment is to answer the question “what are we both trying to get out of this meeting?” Additionally, you want to find out what it is you need to put a proposal together. Identify the reason for the meeting, and clarify what the outcome should be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the point to decide how long the meeting will last. You can say something like, “I have an hour for this meeting, but if we need more time I can reschedule the other meeting.” I often find that after an hour or so your attention starts to wane. If you’re listening and engaging, an hour is a long time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also the time to clarify the potential client’s goals. Ask them directly: “If you had the perfect partner for this project, what would they look like?” Listen to what they have to say, and ask clarifying questions. You want to learn what’s important to them, and what the main purchasing decision is for each person present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As your potential client outlines what they need in a partner, make a note about how you can address each need. This is valuable, because some clients will have needs that you simply can’t meet. If there’s a problem you can’t overcome, you don’t want to waste time putting together a proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Third Step Of A First Meeting: Clarify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step is where you show off your listening skills and confirm what your potential client has already revealed. This process should be concise and straight to the point. Read back what they’ve said to you in the form of a short summary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarifying shows that you’re a great listener while validating everything the other person has said. It also makes a great opening sentence for your proposal: “You’ve asked us to…” It reinforces the idea that you’re sharp. You’re professional. You’re not a designer – you’re a consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693881fedbce6e_image-blog-tn-the-anatomy-of-a-first-meeting-2.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fourth Step Of A First Meeting: Ask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to ask some important questions. First, find out what that person is looking for in a proposal. Do they want case studies? Do they want an outline of your process? Do they want to know about your pricing structure? Do they want you to lay out a schedule? Do they want all of the above, plus more? This is where you find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the meeting is also your opportunity to ask, “what will it take for you to buy from me?” It’s up to you whether you ask this question in every meeting. If things are going perfectly and no one is raising any objections, it might not be necessary. However, this question will reveal exactly where you and your potential client are aligned. The more you know what they’re looking for in a partner, the more likely you are to make a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the ask portion of your meeting wisely also keeps you from being put on the defense for objections. For example, I get objections on cost quite often. As soon as I feel that an objection may come up, I’ll slip in, “I’m not sure you can afford our services.” They’ll start making up reasons why they can afford you. Use this part of the meeting to redirect to reduce the impact of objections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;T&lt;strong&gt;he Final Step Of A First Meeting: Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transition from the ask section of your meeting by clearly asking your client “would you like us to put a proposal together?” If they say yes, or (even better) if they’ve asked you to begin with, it’s time to move onto your next steps. Find out more about what they need. Do they need a proposal by the end of the week? Are they looking for something specific? Make a note of it, then make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

You want to learn what’s important to them, and what the main purchasing decision is for each person present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As your potential client outlines what they need in a partner, make a note about how you can address each need. This is valuable, because some clients will have needs that you simply can’t meet. If there’s a problem you can’t overcome, you don’t want to waste time putting together a proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Third Step Of A First Meeting: Clarify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This step is where you show off your listening skills and confirm what your potential client has already revealed. This process should be concise and straight to the point. Read back what they’ve said to you in the form of a short summary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clarifying shows that you’re a great listener while validating everything the other person has said. It also makes a great opening sentence for your proposal: “You’ve asked us to…” It reinforces the idea that you’re sharp. You’re professional. You’re not a designer – you’re a consultant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693881fedbce6e_image-blog-tn-the-anatomy-of-a-first-meeting-2.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fourth Step Of A First Meeting: Ask&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to ask some important questions. First, find out what that person is looking for in a proposal. Do they want case studies? Do they want an outline of your process? Do they want to know about your pricing structure? Do they want you to lay out a schedule? Do they want all of the above, plus more? This is where you find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This part of the meeting is also your opportunity to ask, “what will it take for you to buy from me?” It’s up to you whether you ask this question in every meeting. If things are going perfectly and no one is raising any objections, it might not be necessary. However, this question will reveal exactly where you and your potential client are aligned. The more you know what they’re looking for in a partner, the more likely you are to make a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the ask portion of your meeting wisely also keeps you from being put on the defense for objections. For example, I get objections on cost quite often. As soon as I feel that an objection may come up, I’ll slip in, “I’m not sure you can afford our services.” They’ll start making up reasons why they can afford you. Use this part of the meeting to redirect to reduce the impact of objections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;T&lt;strong&gt;he Final Step Of A First Meeting: Next Steps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transition from the ask section of your meeting by clearly asking your client “would you like us to put a proposal together?” If they say yes, or (even better) if they’ve asked you to begin with, it’s time to move onto your next steps. Find out more about what they need. Do they need a proposal by the end of the week? Are they looking for something specific? Make a note of it, then make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question deserved a more thoughtful answer so I thought I’d share my show prep and note-taking for you guys to check out and maybe pick up some new tactics for both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before every event or meeting, I research and prepare questions beforehand. Even though I have many questions, I often just try to listen and follow the conversation in an organic manner. Naturally, the conversation leads me to other questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this example, I’m sharing my notes from a conversation with Von Glitschka. Von is an illustrative designer, author, and founder of GLITSCHKA STUDIOS. Von has a long list of clients comprised of some of the most well-known brands, including Adobe, McDonald’s, Planters, and Capri Sun. He collaborates with ad agencies, design firms, in-house corporate art departments, and small businesses to produce compelling visual narratives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of his Studio work, Von offers one-on-one sessions teaching vector art, creative consultations, workshops, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had the awesome chance to interview Von to learn about his journey into illustrative design and how he’s established his unique creative process. Given the fact that my interview subject was going to have some pretty juicy responses, a proper note-taking process was in order for me to get the most out of our conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, you will find some of the answers I got, and get a first-hand look into my thought process. If you have an important interview coming up, or don’t know what questions to ask for your next one, I hope this helps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And yes, ironically, these notes are images from my pen and paper.

    <title>Massimo Vignelli: Best Quotes</title>
    <updated>2017-06-25T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-06-25:/blog/massimo-vignelli-best-quotes</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massimo Vignelli was a graphic designer, industrial designer and architect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Milan, Italy, Massimo studied art and architecture in Milan and Venice until he arrived in the United States in 1957. Then in 1960, he and his wife, Lella, established the Vignelli Office of Design and Architecture in Milan, which, at one point, became one of the largest design firms in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1965, he founded Unimark International in Chicago, Illinois with his wife. It was during this time that Massimo introduced Helvetica into visual communication systems, and sent designers across the United States in a frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massimo was a true tour de force, having worked in nearly every field of design: advertising, identity, packaging, product, industrial, interior, and architecture. Massimo always leaned towards modernism, keeping his creations free of clutter and full of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His work has been published all over the world. Massimo’s most notable and memorable pieces of work include the classic “AA” American Airlines logo, the New York City Subway map and signage system, and the typeface, Our Bodoni. Some of the most well-known locations that featured his pieces include the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massimo passed in 2014 due to illness. He was 83 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has left quite a mark on the design industry, and serves as a constant beam of inspiration.

We’re sure it will live on for years and years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massimo was most famous for his ethos, “If you can design one thing, you can design everything.” This collection we’ve made is a tribute to some of Massimo’s best quotes.

    <title>Massimo Vignelli: Best Quotes</title>
    <updated>2017-06-25T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massimo Vignelli was a graphic designer, industrial designer and architect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Milan, Italy, Massimo studied art and architecture in Milan and Venice until he arrived in the United States in 1957. Then in 1960, he and his wife, Lella, established the Vignelli Office of Design and Architecture in Milan, which, at one point, became one of the largest design firms in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1965, he founded Unimark International in Chicago, Illinois with his wife. It was during this time that Massimo introduced Helvetica into visual communication systems, and sent designers across the United States in a frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massimo was a true tour de force, having worked in nearly every field of design: advertising, identity, packaging, product, industrial, interior, and architecture. Massimo always leaned towards modernism, keeping his creations free of clutter and full of simplicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His work has been published all over the world. Massimo’s most notable and memorable pieces of work include the classic “AA” American Airlines logo, the New York City Subway map and signage system, and the typeface, Our Bodoni. Some of the most well-known locations that featured his pieces include the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massimo passed in 2014 due to illness. He was 83 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has left quite a mark on the design industry, and serves as a constant beam of inspiration. His last book, &lt;em&gt;The Vignelli Canon&lt;/em&gt;, is meant to preserve his legacy. We’re sure it will live on for years and years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Massimo was most famous for his ethos, “If you can design one thing, you can design everything.” This collection we’ve made is a tribute to some of Massimo’s best quotes. We hope you feel inspired.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693890bbdbce7d_Poster-Template12.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d2693840aadbce7e_Poster-Template11.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938661fdbce80_Poster-Template10_page1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385b9adbce7f_Poster-Template09.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269387aaadbce81_Poster-Template08.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381066dbce84_Poster-Template07.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269383b78dbce82_Poster-Template06.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269385ccadbce83_Poster-Template05.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269381dd9dbce85_Poster-Template04.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269387218dbce87_Poster-Template03_page1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269388a3bdbce86_Poster-Template02_page1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>Why You’re Unwilling to Charge What You’re Worth</title>
    <updated>2017-06-12T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-06-12:/blog/why-youre-unwilling-to-charge-what-youre-worth</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between charging a price that seems “safe” and “comfortable” versus requiring your clients to pay your full value is confidence. What school you went to, where you live, your previous experience; none of that really matters. What matters is having the confidence to place a high value on what you do. Do you have that confidence? If you’re here, and if you’re like many other designers, you probably don’t. Why are designers almost “programmed” to undervalue and undersell what they do? Here’s what I’ve come up with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;W&lt;strong&gt;hy You Don’t Have The Confidence to Ask for More&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may be a humble person in most areas of your life, but to start making what you’re worth you have to start building your confidence. Confidence starts on the inside. And yeah, it’s easier said than done, but one of the first things you can do is take a closer look at your mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start by reading the following sentence: “People regularly pay $5000 for logos that aren’t much different than the ones you’re making for $50.” What’s your internal dialogue saying? How are you speaking to yourself? Are you saying things like “that’s impossible”? What about, “Maybe other designers could do that, but there’s no way I could pull it off”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think sometimes we need permission from somebody that we trust and respect to just let ourselves ask for what we’re worth. We get used to boxing ourselves into a tight space, internally using words that we may not even be aware we’re using. Maybe you describe yourself by what you used to do (“I’m an ex-marine, I’m a former teacher”) instead of what you currently do. You don’t feel comfortable calling yourself what you are: an innovative, inventive designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As those thoughts echo around in your head, another issue starts to arise: imposter syndrome. You may have heard of this before. It’s rampant in creative world. You feel like you’re an imposter. You feel like you’re not qualified to do what you’re doing, that you’re just pretending. You’re apologetic, waiting for someone to discover you and call you out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We spend a lot of time comparing ourselves to others. In one sense, that’s okay, because it’s how we grow. But in another sense, comparison can be our biggest enemy. You say, “I don’t know myself as a professional. I don’t know any other professional designers. I don’t know what it means to be a professional designer, but I know I’m not that guy. I didn’t go to a private art school. I don’t live in an area known for design. I didn’t do this, that, and the other thing. Because of that, I’m just pretending to be a professional.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re constantly receiving these types of messages, of course you’re not going to feel confident in charging more for your design. How could you? If you’re an “imposter,” charging more puts you at greater risk of exposure. Even more, raising your prices feels wrong. You don’t feel right charging what a “professional” would, because you see yourself as an amateur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transitioning out of your current mindset into a mindset of confidence will transform how you approach your clients, your business, and your pricing structure. I’d like to challenge you to pay closer attention to your inner dialogue. What are you telling yourself right now after reading this? Are they the words of a professional, or someone who sees themselves as an imposter?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>How to Move Past Your $50 Clients</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re sick of doing logos for $50, $100, or even $500. You value your design more highly than that. How do you find clients who do, too?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It starts with understanding the mindset of the people you want to work with, as well as the people you’re working with now. Here’s what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;W&lt;strong&gt;hy You Don’t Want Referrals From A $50 Client&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’ve completed a logo for $50. Your client loves it. They’re showering you with praise. They’re going to tell all their friends about you. Great, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s going to happen is those referrals are going to come to you expecting the same service at the same price. They’re not going to be someone who’ll pay $5000 for a logo. &lt;em&gt;People tend to associate with similar people&lt;/em&gt;. The person looking for a $50 logo for her Etsy shop probably isn’t going to be sending lots of small to medium businesses your way. You have to find those clients on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;U&lt;strong&gt;nderstanding Client Mindsets and Pain Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do to find high paying clients is to understand their mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think about how many small businesses are in your area. Shoe stores. Tattoo shops. Barber shops. Restaurants. Coffee shops. That one shop you’ve never been into that sells the little figurines your mom likes so much. Every single one of those businesses need three things: a logo that looks professional, a website, and some level of social media marketing. Every single one of those businesses want to differentiate themselves. Many of them can afford to spend much more than $50 to do so. That’s their mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equally important is understanding their pain points. What do these clients need? What problems are they facing? What’s making them really, really frustrated? How can you address it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blog can be a good way to start. I see a lot of designers keeping a blog, but only focusing on the stuff they’re interested in. You need to turn it around – provide content that your potential clients find useful. Add value by answering questions they have. Guide them through finding, hiring, and working with a designer before you meet them. By the time you have your first meeting, you’ll have created a great client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another pain point I often see in clients is that when they started their business they did things cheaply. Now that they’re more established, they feel embarrassed when they hand out their business cards because they just don’t look good. Rarely have I met a client that feels the external facing parts of their brand matches how they feel about it on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The power of a designer is they can make things look more expensive and of a higher quality than they are. You can make a million dollar company look like a billion dollar company. You can make a mom and pop shop feel like a reputable, substantial, and powerful brand. This is where you excel, and that’s what you need to show potential clients in your portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving past your $50 clients means understanding and interacting with a new type of client. Think about the mindset and pain points of a $5000 client and how you can best address them. The more you focus on the clients you want to work with, the less you’ll have to rely on the clients you have now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

Each lesson makes it easy and fun to get inspired, learn techniques, and gain skills for designing your next logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to design a great logo is a core skill in a graphic designer’s toolkit. When you think of a business or brand, the first thing that comes to mind is nearly always the logo. It is the visual representation of that product, place, thing, or business. Its impact is huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as for style? The power of simplicity should never be underestimated, as oftentimes simple shapes and colors communicate a stronger message than an over-done image. It creates an immediate impression in a viewer’s mind.&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Design-a-Logo-in-Modern-Style/1200154057&#34;&gt;‍&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Design-a-Logo-in-Modern-Style/1200154057&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learn more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938e09bdbce8f_7fb8177c-300x90.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logo Design With Grids: Timeless Style From Simple Shapes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes a logo design feel “perfect”? How do you fine-tune simple shapes to achieve visual stopping power? Learn how to design a modern, minimalistic logo from start to finish, and then add that extra punch of perfection to make it stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this 30-minute class, graphic designer George Bokhua walks us through his process of incorporating grids and geometric shapes into logos so that you can unlock that feeling of timelessness in your own marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Logo-Design-with-Grids-Timeless-Style-from-Simple-Shapes/683637231?via=search-layout-grid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learn more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Logo Design: Gridding with The Golden Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join George as he reveals his personal technique for creating complex logos that stand the test of time. Also known as the Golden Spiral or Golden Section, the Golden Ratio is a proportion known to be particularly pleasing to the eye.

In this 45 minute class, you’ll learn how to grid your work with the Golden Spiral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Mastering-Logo-Design-Gridding-with-the-Golden-Ratio/774191846?via=search-layout-grid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learn more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269387f93dbce91_956a9b13-150x150.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logo Design with Draplin: Secrets of Shape, Type and Color&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portland-based designer Aaron Draplin is legendary for pride and craftsmanship he brings to every project.

Once you master customizing type, you’ll have a powerful skill in your design toolkit for every branding, logo, and visual styling project that comes your way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Customizing-Type-with-Draplin-Creating-Wordmarks-That-Work/1395825904&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learn more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269386d0edbce90_e9338f7f-150x150.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Circular Logo Design with Draplin: Combine Type &amp;amp; Icons in A Classic Shape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to level up your logo design?

Each lesson makes it easy and fun to get inspired, learn techniques, and gain skills for designing your next logo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to design a great logo is a core skill in a graphic designer’s toolkit. When you think of a business or brand, the first thing that comes to mind is nearly always the logo. It is the visual representation of that product, place, thing, or business. Its impact is huge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as for style? The power of simplicity should never be underestimated, as oftentimes simple shapes and colors communicate a stronger message than an over-done image. It creates an immediate impression in a viewer’s mind.&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Design-a-Logo-in-Modern-Style/1200154057&#34;&gt;‍&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Design-a-Logo-in-Modern-Style/1200154057&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learn more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d26938e09bdbce8f_7fb8177c-300x90.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logo Design With Grids: Timeless Style From Simple Shapes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes a logo design feel “perfect”? How do you fine-tune simple shapes to achieve visual stopping power? Learn how to design a modern, minimalistic logo from start to finish, and then add that extra punch of perfection to make it stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this 30-minute class, graphic designer George Bokhua walks us through his process of incorporating grids and geometric shapes into logos so that you can unlock that feeling of timelessness in your own marks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Logo-Design-with-Grids-Timeless-Style-from-Simple-Shapes/683637231?via=search-layout-grid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learn more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mastering Logo Design: Gridding with The Golden Ratio&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join George as he reveals his personal technique for creating complex logos that stand the test of time. Also known as the Golden Spiral or Golden Section, the Golden Ratio is a proportion known to be particularly pleasing to the eye. By using it to grid his logos, George ensures that every mark he makes evokes a feeling of perfection. In this 45 minute class, you’ll learn how to grid your work with the Golden Spiral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Mastering-Logo-Design-Gridding-with-the-Golden-Ratio/774191846?via=search-layout-grid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Learn more here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269387f93dbce91_956a9b13-150x150.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Logo Design with Draplin: Secrets of Shape, Type and Color&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portland-based designer Aaron Draplin is legendary for pride and craftsmanship he brings to every project.

    <title>Why You Should Be Viewing Your Time as a Resource</title>
    <updated>2017-05-29T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s no doubt that it can be awkward asking for more money when a project exceeds its original scope. However, that’s not enough of a reason to keep pouring your time into a project without compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;W&lt;strong&gt;hy Designers Don’t Like to Ask for Overages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve talked to a lot of designers who have gone through the following situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re working with a client who is requesting revisions. Lots of them. You’re on your umpteenth round and they keep asking for more work. You’re pouring time and effort in, but you don’t feel right about asking for more money. In fact, the thought of doing so makes you feel kind of shady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many things in the design business, it’s all about mindset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes designers just want to avoid conflict. Other times they feel that once a price is agreed upon, it’s unscrupulous to change it. And in some cases it’s because designers don’t value their time. It’s not like there are any raw materials that go into creating a logo, right? Additional revisions don’t cost you anything besides your time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rethinking How You View Your Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you think spending time on a project doesn’t cost you anything, you need to change your mindset. Your time is a resource. In fact, it’s the most valuable resource you have. It is completely non-renewable. Once you spend it on something, you’ll never get it back. So why would you give it away for free? When you do, the only thing you’re doing is undermining your value and self worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I like to look at it this way: let’s say you buy a pair of designer jeans for $120. Those jeans used a relatively small amount of materials and were mass produced in a third world country, but you have no problem spending $120 on them. But what about the work you put into a design? Designing a logo is a creative process that requires specialized skills, yet so many of us are willing to value it at less than the cost of a pair of jeans. Not only are we willing to value it as less, we often feel bad about valuing it as more. There’s a lack of symmetry in the logic there. This kind of thinking is lopsided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do you get your approach to pricing back on track? Think about it like this: you order a beer at a bar. It costs you $7. You drink it, but when you’re done you’re still thirsty. Would you expect the bar to keep refilling your glass for free until you’re ready to leave? Absolutely not. Would the bar owner feel shady handing you a bill for five glasses of beer at the end of the night if that’s what you drank? Absolutely not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your time is a resource. Be careful how you pour it out. Personally, I price my design services to include two “refills” (rounds of revisions). If any more than that are needed, I request an overage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s nothing shady about being compensated for the resources you use to create something for a client. Time is the most precious resource we have, and as such it is crucial to be compensated for spending it. Understanding and believing this idea is critical if you want to be paid appropriately for what you do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>Why We’re Tempted to Undervalue Design</title>
    <updated>2017-05-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-05-22:/blog/why-we-are-tempted-to-undervalue-design</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m shocked at the numbers I get when I ask this question. Time and again I’ll have young designers tell me that they charge as low as $50 for a logo design. That’s crazy to me! But it got me wondering – why would you charge $50 for a logo? And, even more telling, why would you &lt;em&gt;continue&lt;/em&gt; to charge such a small amount? After talking with a few designers who have fallen into this trap, here are the answers I’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Why Work for $50?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons why you might charge $50 for your first few logos:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re Finding Clients in the Wrong Places:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re getting your clients from sources where low prices are the norm, or working with people who don’t understand or value design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Don’t Know Your Design’s True Value:&lt;/strong&gt; You haven’t educated yourself on how much what you do is worth. Therefore, you accept whatever price the client assigns, or whatever “feels” right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Feels Great:&lt;/strong&gt; Because you’re delivering high value design at a low price, your clients are over the moon with what you’re providing. You’re getting great feedback, and feeling fulfilled because you’re getting paid to do creative work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For your first logo, you do what you have to do. You get your first client, do the work, and get paid. But what comes next? Are you the person who says, “$50 seems to be the going rate for logo design, I better stick with that”? Or are you the person who says, “I did a great job on that $50 logo – next I’ll try to charge $100”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Context and Confidence&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between someone who charges an appropriate amount for their design and someone who is stuck in a rut of undervaluing their skills comes down to two words: context and confidence. To value your design appropriately, you first need a &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;. You need to know what other people are charging. The AIGA guidebook of prices can be a great place to start. Try talking to graphic designers who are further ahead than you in similar careers. What you’ll probably learn from those conversations is that designers are charging &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more than you are for work that isn’t all that different. So how can they charge so much more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confidence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to shift your mindset. How do you view what you create? You could go to a swap meet and buy a cheap pair of plastic frame glasses for $20. Or you could go to a high end optical shop and buy a pair of designer frames for $600. The people who make designer frames make fewer glasses at a higher price. The people who make the plastic frames have a high volume at a lower cost. Both can survive and thrive in this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Which One Are You Going to Be?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re charging $50 for essentially the same product that “high end” designers are charging tens of thousands of dollars for. What you charge for that depends on the value that you place on it. Your pricing structure can’t change until your mindset does. When you start seeing your design as a luxury, premium item, your confidence (and your income) will start to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>Why We’re Tempted to Undervalue Design</title>
    <updated>2017-05-22T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-05-22:/blog/why-we-are-tempted-to-undervalue-design</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m shocked at the numbers I get when I ask this question. Time and again I’ll have young designers tell me that they charge as low as $50 for a logo design. That’s crazy to me! But it got me wondering – why would you charge $50 for a logo? And, even more telling, why would you &lt;em&gt;continue&lt;/em&gt; to charge such a small amount? After talking with a few designers who have fallen into this trap, here are the answers I’ve found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Why Work for $50?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a few reasons why you might charge $50 for your first few logos:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re Finding Clients in the Wrong Places:&lt;/strong&gt; You’re getting your clients from sources where low prices are the norm, or working with people who don’t understand or value design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You Don’t Know Your Design’s True Value:&lt;/strong&gt; You haven’t educated yourself on how much what you do is worth. Therefore, you accept whatever price the client assigns, or whatever “feels” right.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It Feels Great:&lt;/strong&gt; Because you’re delivering high value design at a low price, your clients are over the moon with what you’re providing. You’re getting great feedback, and feeling fulfilled because you’re getting paid to do creative work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For your first logo, you do what you have to do. You get your first client, do the work, and get paid. But what comes next? Are you the person who says, “$50 seems to be the going rate for logo design, I better stick with that”? Or are you the person who says, “I did a great job on that $50 logo – next I’ll try to charge $100”?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Context and Confidence&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference between someone who charges an appropriate amount for their design and someone who is stuck in a rut of undervaluing their skills comes down to two words: context and confidence. To value your design appropriately, you first need a &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;. You need to know what other people are charging. The AIGA guidebook of prices can be a great place to start. Try talking to graphic designers who are further ahead than you in similar careers. What you’ll probably learn from those conversations is that designers are charging &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; more than you are for work that isn’t all that different. So how can they charge so much more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Confidence&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s time to shift your mindset. How do you view what you create? You could go to a swap meet and buy a cheap pair of plastic frame glasses for $20. Or you could go to a high end optical shop and buy a pair of designer frames for $600. The people who make designer frames make fewer glasses at a higher price. The people who make the plastic frames have a high volume at a lower cost. Both can survive and thrive in this world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Which One Are You Going to Be?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re charging $50 for essentially the same product that “high end” designers are charging tens of thousands of dollars for.

    <title>How to Show Confidence Without Knowing Everything</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll be the first to admit that it’s one thing to claim you’re okay with not knowing everything, but it’s another to get that across to the people you’re talking to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you effectively diffuse a new situation by explaining that you don’t know everything without giving the impression that you don’t know, well, anything? Here’s what I like to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Asking VS. Telling&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where a lot of people trip up is subscribing to the idea that admitting you don’t know something comes across as weakness. That’s a very outdated idea, and one we need to move on from. When I walk into a new situation, I defuse it immediately by positioning myself as an equal, rather than someone who dictates change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reality is, no matter how great a designer you are, there’s no way you know as much about your client’s business as they do. And there’s nothing wrong with telling them that! I may say something like this: “No amount of research or prep can get me to learn as much as you know about your business. I want to learn with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does saying something like that tell your client? It says you’re approaching the project as equals, that you’re going to listen very carefully, that you’re going to ask a lot of questions, and that you’re not going to make any assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Confidence and Listening&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest benefits of admitting you don’t know everything is that it gives you a chance to become a very, very good listener. This is especially true if you’re like me (and many other designers) and tend to be very introverted. People will walk away saying, “It looks like you’re thinking hard about what we’ve been talking about,” when really I’ve just been listening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what if you’re not the type to be quiet in a meeting? Find other ways to show that you’re focused on listening. Take notes. Write down cues from what the other person is saying instead of interrupting them. Sip your coffee. Think of it as focused fidgeting: communicate that you’re listening in whatever way is most natural to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;E&lt;strong&gt;go Intensifies, Confidence Diffuses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking into a meeting is nerve-wracking for both parties involved. If you go in with the attitude that you know everything, you intensify that nervousness on both ends. You worry about making a mistake, the client worries about looking dumb in front of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when you go in saying, “I’m still learning, but I think I know what can help you, and I’m willing to give it a try if you are,” you diffuse the situation. The pressure is off you to deliver results you can’t guarantee, and your client no longer feels they need to prove themselves to you. You can approach the problem as equals, likely leading to greater results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Approaching interactions with the attitude that you don’t know everything can transform how you conduct your business. It will also naturally lead to greater confidence. When you let go of the idea that you need to be the undisputed expert in all matters, your natural abilities will shine through. From there you’ll be able to start getting real work done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>Say &#34;I Don&#39;t Know&#34; And Become Confident</title>
    <updated>2017-05-08T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-05-08:/blog/be-confident-saying-i-dont-know</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re like a good 90% of designers, the idea makes you a least a little uncomfortable. So how do you react? Do you try to convince the client that you know the answer to every problem they’ve ever had, or do you admit up front that you don’t know everything?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As counterintuitive as it might seem, it’s the second option that truly leads to confidence. Here’s why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Understanding the Context&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you walk into a room to give a presentation to a client. You feel like there’s a gigantic spotlight on you. You feel judged. You feel like the only way to make it through the meeting is to convince the client that you know everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it’s not so different from the client’s perspective. In most cases they’re just as nervous as you are. And in most cases they’re just as eager to make a good impression. If you walk in trying to convince them that you know everything, you’ll make the client even more nervous. Why? Because they don’t want to be wrong, either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And let’s take that thought one step further. Let’s say you walk in wanting to prove to the client that you have an answer for their every question. What happens when you inevitably slip up? If you emphatically say something that your client knows is wrong, you’ve immediately lost all credibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Confidence to Say &amp;#34;I Don&amp;#39;t Know&amp;#34;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us have that little voice inside of us that says it’s not okay not to know something. If you let that voice win, one of two things might happen: you never have the confidence to get yourself off the ground, or you end up overcompensating and sounding arrogant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ego can easily get in the way and keep you from admitting that you don’t know what you’re talking about. Your ego says you have to be smart, wealthy, and all-knowing. And if you’re not all of those things (aka: just like everyone else), it will try to convince you that you don’t belong. You end up feeling like an imposter in your career, and maybe in your life, just waiting for someone to find you out. If you let those feelings go unchecked, you may end up needing to put other people down to feel better about yourself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remedy to ego, arrogance, and a lack of confidence is openly and freely admitting that, while you do have expertise in what you do, you don’t know everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buying into the idea that you have to know everything may feel like confidence on the surface, but it’s actually just the opposite. Confidence is freely admitting that there’s no way to be an expert in everything. Openly admitting this to clients is refreshing and diffuses nervousness and tension for both parties. You&amp;#39;ll feel the atmosphere change in a room when you say, “I don’t know as much about your business as you do, so I want to learn with you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to approach your next interaction with confidence, there’s no greater tool than humility. Be honest with others (and, more importantly, with yourself) about what you do and do not know. When you let go of the idea that you need to know everything, you open yourself up to interactions that are more authentic, more satisfying, and much more productive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>How to Boost Your Confidence</title>
    <updated>2017-04-24T00:00:00Z</updated>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my last blog, I talked about building confidence by figuring out what you’re good at. But what do you do after that? You can be the best person in the world at something, but if you don’t present yourself that way, you’re not going to feel any more confident. I’ve found that the most effective way to translate that inner feeling of confidence to the people around you is to find someone to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Copying Someone is One Of the Best Ways to Boost Your Confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all know someone who oozes natural confidence, even if they’re not that special. They’re not particularly good looking, they’re not overly charismatic, they’re not rich, but they carry themselves in a way that screams “I’m comfortable with who I am.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wouldn’t it be great to be like that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, why not try it on for size? That’s what I did. I met someone who projected the type of confidence I wanted to have and modeled myself after them. As if I was an understudy to a great actor, I watched what he did, what he said, his mannerisms, and how he presented himself to people. I saw that he went out of his way to say hello, to ask how people were doing, and to follow up with them over time. I watched &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; he did what he did, and practiced doing the same thing in my own conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my situation one of the things that made modeling so easy and natural is that the person I was emulating had no real advantage over me. I could relate to them. They weren’t intimidating to me; they were just someone who was doing what I wanted to do. And that’s what makes modeling such an accessible way to gain confidence. We all know someone who has traits we wish we had. There’s always someone you can model a part of yourself after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Finding a Mentor&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s sharing culture, explicitly reaching out to someone to let them know you’re modeling them is becoming the norm. Think of how flattered you’d be if someone came up to you and said, “I really admire you and I’d love to ask you more about what you do. Could I take you out for coffee sometime and learn a little more about your process?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, people are pretty busy these days, so if the person you ask to model turns you down or you don’t get a response, it doesn’t mean anything. You didn’t mess up, and it’s not that they don’t like you. But the simple act of reaching out can boost your confidence and put you in a position to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Try it On for Size&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you emulate someone, you liberate yourself from your identity. It doesn’t matter how quiet, introverted, or unconfident you feel. If you walk into a room and pretend to be the most popular person there, you’ll start to feel it. It will influence the way you present yourself and the way you interact with others. Over time that confidence will build and carry over into other situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t overemphasize how valuable the practice of modeling has been to me over the course of my career (and my life). Try it on for size – you may be surprised by how much it makes you grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>Building Self-Confidence As a Designer: Foundation</title>
    <updated>2017-04-17T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-04-17:/blog/designer-building-self-confidence</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what about building self-confidence as a designer? Do you consider yourself a confident person? If you don’t, it’s time to start changing how you think. Confidence isn’t an innate trait. It’s something you can (and really need to) develop. In my experience, there are three components that go into building confidence. The first of those is &lt;em&gt;building a foundation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you do better than anyone else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m not a particularly outgoing person, and I can’t say that confidence has come naturally to me. But one of the biggest things that helped me become a more confident person was realizing that I was good at design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I loved to draw from an early age, and decided to pursue design as a profession. When I did, I found out that I had natural talent there and was able to develop it quickly. Realizing that gave me something to latch on to: I was a designer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have something you’re naturally great at, too. It may not be design. It could be that you’re great at talking with people, great at presenting and teaching ideas, or amazing at strategizing. Let that be what you focus your lens on. It’s the thing that makes you different, and it’s your foundation for growing confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;T&lt;strong&gt;he inside reflects outward‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you don’t see yourself as something, it’s incredibly hard to sell yourself as that thing. However, if you start to see yourself as something inwardly, an amazing thing happens: you start to project it outwardly as well. People start to see you as that thing, and approach you on that level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you’re comfortable with who you are, people gravitate towards you. I see it particularly often with people who are spiritual or religious. They’re not about their money or possessions, they’re not fronting: they’re just comfortable in their skin. Other people feel that comfort, and are drawn to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of authenticity is a huge asset in sales. When you’re comfortable with who you are, you are able to present yourself to others with confidence. You know what you’re good at, and you can express that clearly and honestly. What you feel about yourself inwardly reflects outwardly, and the people you’re selling to will respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;S&lt;strong&gt;tart building self-confidence now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it’s your goal to be more confident and comfortable with yourself, knowing what you’re good at is the first step. So what is it you love to do? What comes naturally? What can you do easily that others seem to struggle with? Start building your foundation there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The thing you’re best at might not necessarily be the thing you’ve envisioned yourself doing. That’s okay! The more honest you are about where your strengths lie, the more seamlessly you’ll be able to move to a position of confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great confidence begins with a great foundation. And building self-confidence as a designer isn’t easy. So first, discover what you’re best at, and use it to grow in ability and assurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>Why Listening to Understand is Important to Selling</title>
    <updated>2017-04-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-04-11:/blog/listening-to-sell</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I want to make it clear just how important listening is when it comes to sales. We’ve all heard the cliche of the door-to-door vacuum salesman who bullies his way into your house and harasses you to buy – even when you don’t have a carpet. None of us want to be that guy. That’s where listening comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Listening to Understand&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening to understand a potential client is absolutely critical if you’re trying to make a sale. I’ve coached people who put a lot of emphasis on jumping right to the close. Not only does this create friction in the conversation, but it’s also a sign that you’re doing the exact opposite of listening. Instead of trying to understand what that person wants or needs, you get wrapped up in your own agenda, and you both walk away from the conversation frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you make a point to really listen and understand what the other person is saying? Instead of walking into a conversation with the intent of convincing the person that they need you, make it your goal to be genuinely interested in what they have to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure where to start? Ask questions. Ask them about their business. What do they do? How is it going? What drives them? As they talk and you listen, they’ll start to let you know about problems they’re having. I like to keep a mental checklist as we talk. “Can I solve this problem? No, it looks like I can’t. But I can solve the next one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great salespeople listen, and they understand the underlying motivations and objectives within the context of the person they’re listening to. The only way to do that is to have a genuine interest in what the other person is saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Listening and Confidence&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you take the time to listen and really understand what someone is telling you, you’ll find your confidence in your own skills grows. Here’s a story to illustrate what I mean by that. I once had a client call me asking to have some video work done. After asking him a few questions and really listening to what he said, I realized that creating a video would be a complete expense for him. It just wasn’t something that made sense to do. So I turned down the job, and told him to come back to me when he wanted to talk about strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By actively listening to what he had to say, I had the confidence to know that I had more to offer him than just the work product. And you have more to offer, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re not a vacuum salesperson trying to bust down someone’s door. You’re offering solutions to problems that a lot of people have. Listening is the key to finding and understanding those problems, and to providing a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How&amp;#39;s Your Listening?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your approach to sales guided by a genuine interest in what the people you interact with need? If not, why isn’t it, and what do you need to do to get there? Prioritizing listening may seem like a departure from the way you’re used to approaching sales, but when you give it a try you’ll see that the results are absolutely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>Why Listening to Understand is Important to Selling</title>
    <updated>2017-04-11T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-04-11:/blog/listening-to-sell</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I want to make it clear just how important listening is when it comes to sales. We’ve all heard the cliche of the door-to-door vacuum salesman who bullies his way into your house and harasses you to buy – even when you don’t have a carpet. None of us want to be that guy. That’s where listening comes in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Listening to Understand&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening to understand a potential client is absolutely critical if you’re trying to make a sale. I’ve coached people who put a lot of emphasis on jumping right to the close. Not only does this create friction in the conversation, but it’s also a sign that you’re doing the exact opposite of listening. Instead of trying to understand what that person wants or needs, you get wrapped up in your own agenda, and you both walk away from the conversation frustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happens when you make a point to really listen and understand what the other person is saying? Instead of walking into a conversation with the intent of convincing the person that they need you, make it your goal to be genuinely interested in what they have to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not sure where to start? Ask questions. Ask them about their business. What do they do? How is it going? What drives them? As they talk and you listen, they’ll start to let you know about problems they’re having. I like to keep a mental checklist as we talk. “Can I solve this problem? No, it looks like I can’t. But I can solve the next one.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great salespeople listen, and they understand the underlying motivations and objectives within the context of the person they’re listening to. The only way to do that is to have a genuine interest in what the other person is saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Listening and Confidence&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you take the time to listen and really understand what someone is telling you, you’ll find your confidence in your own skills grows. Here’s a story to illustrate what I mean by that. I once had a client call me asking to have some video work done. After asking him a few questions and really listening to what he said, I realized that creating a video would be a complete expense for him. It just wasn’t something that made sense to do. So I turned down the job, and told him to come back to me when he wanted to talk about strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By actively listening to what he had to say, I had the confidence to know that I had more to offer him than just the work product. And you have more to offer, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re not a vacuum salesperson trying to bust down someone’s door. You’re offering solutions to problems that a lot of people have. Listening is the key to finding and understanding those problems, and to providing a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How&amp;#39;s Your Listening?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your approach to sales guided by a genuine interest in what the people you interact with need? If not, why isn’t it, and what do you need to do to get there? Prioritizing listening may seem like a departure from the way you’re used to approaching sales, but when you give it a try you’ll see that the results are absolutely worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>The Right Sales Mindset to Guide You to the Sale</title>
    <updated>2017-04-03T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-04-03:/blog/right-sales-mindset</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That depends. What’s your sales mindset? There are a lot of different ways to think about how you approach and present yourself to the people you may do business with in the future. Today I want to take a closer look at two of them. The first approaches sales by being focused and direct. The second encourages clients to come to you through cultivating education and influence. Which one is right for you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Sales Mindset 1: Asking for the Sale by Being Focused and Direct&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This approach values being focused and direct in how you ask for a sale. Now, this doesn’t mean walking right up to someone and asking them for work within the first three minutes. Instead, it means creating a scaffold to a frictionless ask within a few conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the keys of this approach is being clear about your own motivations and goals. What are your goals? What solutions can you offer that a prospective client needs? And in the same vein, it’s equally important to acknowledge when the person you’re approaching &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; need what you have. If you’re selling vacuums and they don’t have any carpet, it’s a waste of both of your time to keep pushing towards a sale. Accept that not everyone needs exactly what you’re providing and move on quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key of this focused approach is to qualify a prospect early on. I know from my own experience that you can waste a lot of time on a client whose budget just isn’t big enough to work with you. Don’t be afraid to have a conversation early on to determine if the two of you can conceivably work together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This focused approach will only work for you if you can get over the awkwardness of asking for a sale. Yes, it can feel a little uncomfortable, especially if you’re not used to it. However, if you can get past that awkwardness (and fear) and go for the ask, you can save time and aggravation for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Sales Mindset 2: Building a Reputation Through Education and Influence&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a counterpoint to the more direct, focused approach, you may like the idea of someone coming to you a bit better. That’s great! The world is big enough for more than one approach. So how do you get there? It’s all about cultivating a reputation through education and influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key here is to deliver value up front. Get out there, get speaking, educate people. Invest time into finding opportunities to give back. Seek out places to speak. Volunteer your skills and leverage that time and effort into bigger contracts. Set up webinars. Position yourself as an expert who will guide people through the process to the result they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m going to be honest with you: creating that kind of reputation and influence takes time. It’s not easy. But for the right people it can &lt;em&gt;absolutely&lt;/em&gt; be worth it. The more you get out there, the more you’ll start to hear people say, “Hey, I saw you speaking at X, and I heard you say Y. That really resonated with me – I want to engage you in a project.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Asking for the Sale&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your leads are going to come from the people around you. You can find them by engaging in direct, focused conversation, or by creating the type of value that brings them to you. Commit to the approach that is most in line with your strengths and preferences to start getting your sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Need more advice on finding clients? &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thefutur.com/product/futur-pro-group-membership/&#34;&gt;Try the pro group&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>The Three Principles of a Great Listener</title>
    <updated>2017-03-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-03-27:/blog/principles-of-a-great-listener</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you a good listener? How do you know? And if you aren’t, how do you get better? Knowing the answers to these questions is crucial to getting where you want to be in business and life. In my experience, being a great listener comes down to three principles: listening to understand, asking great questions, and validating what you hear. Here’s my take on how to leverage these three principles in your next conversation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Listening Principle #1 – Listening to Understand&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much do you really understand when you listen to someone? It may be less than you think. Here’s an exercise I recommend to really focus in on where your listening skills are at. Sit down with someone and have them tell you something. Anything. Then, say it back to them verbatim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t paraphrase it, don’t tell them what you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they said, say exactly the words that they did. They’ll tell you how accurate you were. Trust me – this exercise can be very difficult, but very enlightening. Really understanding what someone is saying to you takes practice, focus, and patience. It’s also one of the most important things you can do to ensure you’re being an active listener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Listening Principle #2 – Asking Great Questions&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to get the most out of your conversations is to learn to ask great questions. Find places in your conversation to ask open-ended questions that draw out more about what the other person is trying to say. Simply asking “why” at the right point can uncover information that’s crucial to understanding their point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just as important in sales as it is in your personal conversations. Listen to what a client is telling you, and be persistent in digging deeper with “why” questions. By asking the right questions, I’ve had clients reveal that they don’t really need what I have to offer, saving us both time and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Listening Principle #3 – Validating What You Hear&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, people just want to be heard. Validating what they say reassures them that you’re listening and truly want to understand what they’re saying. How do you validate someone? It’s as simple as saying, “So, what I’m hearing is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;.” Repeat back what they’re saying and make them feel heard. I think validation is such an important part of listening, particularly because so many clients are used to working with people who just don’t care to hear what they have to say. If they’re always fighting with internal teams or working with a director who doesn’t listen, talking with someone who really takes the effort to hear them is very refreshing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does validating help make sure you understand what someone is saying, it also makes other people feel good. It’s as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a great listener is a skill that you can develop. Take these three principles to heart and start using them in your next conversation. You’ll be amazed at how the person you’re speaking to responds, and how much more you get out of the discussion. Practice, practice, practice, and watch your ability to listen and connect with others grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

It may be less than you think. Here’s an exercise I recommend to really focus in on where your listening skills are at. Sit down with someone and have them tell you something. Anything. Then, say it back to them verbatim. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t paraphrase it, don’t tell them what you &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; they said, say exactly the words that they did. They’ll tell you how accurate you were. Trust me – this exercise can be very difficult, but very enlightening. Really understanding what someone is saying to you takes practice, focus, and patience. It’s also one of the most important things you can do to ensure you’re being an active listener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Listening Principle #2 – Asking Great Questions&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another way to get the most out of your conversations is to learn to ask great questions. Find places in your conversation to ask open-ended questions that draw out more about what the other person is trying to say. Simply asking “why” at the right point can uncover information that’s crucial to understanding their point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just as important in sales as it is in your personal conversations. Listen to what a client is telling you, and be persistent in digging deeper with “why” questions. By asking the right questions, I’ve had clients reveal that they don’t really need what I have to offer, saving us both time and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Listening Principle #3 – Validating What You Hear&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oftentimes, people just want to be heard. Validating what they say reassures them that you’re listening and truly want to understand what they’re saying. How do you validate someone? It’s as simple as saying, “So, what I’m hearing is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;.” Repeat back what they’re saying and make them feel heard. I think validation is such an important part of listening, particularly because so many clients are used to working with people who just don’t care to hear what they have to say. If they’re always fighting with internal teams or working with a director who doesn’t listen, talking with someone who really takes the effort to hear them is very refreshing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only does validating help make sure you understand what someone is saying, it also makes other people feel good. It’s as simple as that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being a great listener is a skill that you can develop. Take these three principles to heart and start using them in your next conversation. You’ll be amazed at how the person you’re speaking to responds, and how much more you get out of the discussion. Practice, practice, practice, and watch your ability to listen and connect with others grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>How to Talk About Yourself</title>
    <updated>2017-03-20T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-03-20:/blog/how-to-talk-about-yourself</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to make a sale, you’re going to have to spend some time talking about yourself. For some people, talking about themselves is easy. For others, it feels next to impossible. But explaining what you do and how you can help to someone you just met isn’t supposed to be simple. And even if it feels natural to you, that doesn’t mean you’re doing it &lt;em&gt;well&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’re talking with a potential client. You’ve gotten to know a little about them and their business. You’re getting a feel for what their problem is. Now it’s time to talk about you. What do you say?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The three ways people go wrong when talking about themselves&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve seen a lot of conversations go terribly wrong when people start talking about themselves. Over time, I’ve noticed three major trouble spots that people fall into:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spending Too Much Time Talking About Yourself:&lt;/strong&gt; You get nervous or self-conscious (or maybe just oblivious) and spend way too much time talking about yourself and your business. The person you’re talking to becomes overwhelmed, confused, or just bored.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being Muddled or Confusing About What You Offer:&lt;/strong&gt; A side effect of talking too much. You end up rambling and fail to be specific about what you actually can (and can’t) offer your prospective client.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Failing to Show Personality or Passion: &lt;/strong&gt;In other words,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;you’re just kind of dull. You fail to show any excitement or interest in what you’re doing. The person you’re talking to feels passionate about what they’re doing, but you’re unable to meet them on that level.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you see yourself in any of those categories? I know I’ve fallen into one or two of them before. Here’s what I’ve done (and what I’ve watched others do) to stay on track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The three antidotes to overwhelming, confusing, or boring the people you’re talking to&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Focus on the Problem:&lt;/strong&gt; If you tend to spend too much time talking about yourself, you’re probably not really focusing on the other person or their problem. Knowing how to determine whether or not you can solve someone’s problem will naturally direct and constrain what you say about yourself. I talk much more about this in my “How to Get to the Heart of the Problem” blog.&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Keep it Snappy:&lt;/strong&gt; The fewer words you use, the clearer you’ll need to be to get your point across. Practice explaining what you do in just a couple sentences. For example, here’s something I might say:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’m an Emmy award winning director and designer. We work with Fortune 500 companies and Madison Avenue agencies, but we’re also expanding our business to work with clients just like you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I established myself quickly and concisely. Within two sentences you know my credentials, what I do, who I work with, and that I may be able to solve your problem. No rambling, nothing confusing; just quick, clear, and concise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Show Your Passion: &lt;/strong&gt;Show that you love what you do! Show a point of view, your agency’s culture, or a personality. Let the other person know who you are – as a person and as a business. There’s no need to go over the top, but you want to show that you’re excited about your work and – by extension – would be excited about what &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; do, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;It&amp;#39;s not always easy&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with practice you absolutely can perfect how you talk about yourself on your way to asking for the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

Whether you have purchased something from our store, commented on our Facebook and Instagram posts, or shared our YouTube videos, we have seen it all and we are so very, very thankful for you. You guys and gals are the reason why we get up in the morning and stay up late at night. Our team is incredibly passionate about helping you grow and succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, thank you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are getting &lt;strong&gt;super duper&lt;/strong&gt; close to 100,000 subscribers on The Futur’s YouTube channel (ahem, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-b3c7kxa5vU-bnmaROgvog&#34;&gt;it’s here&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t know about it)! SO EXCITING! And in honor of this tremendous milestone, we want to give back to &lt;strong&gt;you.&lt;/strong&gt; So here it is: We will be flying &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; of you out to Santa Monica where you’re going to stay in a swag room, hang out with Chris Do and the rest of the Futur and Blind teams all day, go out to eat at our fav LA spots and get some epic one-on-one, up close and personal time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Here&amp;#39;s How to Enter:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting immediately, we will take submissions until we hit 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. This could be a day or it could be weeks. The moral of the story is: get your submission in ASAP. As soon as we hit 100K, we’ll pick one submission randomly. Here’s how you get your name in the hat, your hat the ring, and your player in the game:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a selfie wherever you are in the world – bonus points for creativity. Just make sure that we can see your face 🙂&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Post it to Instagram and tag @thefuturishere&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell us why you want to fly out in the description. Hint: We are looking for enthusiasm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure to include the hashtag #FlyMeToTheFutur&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re not already subscribed on YouTube (shame!), do so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress this enough: if you miss a step, your entry won’t be considered. We’re going to be pulling the submission by hashtag, so it’s IMPERATIVE that the hashtag is present. We’re also planning a bonus surprise for everyone who enters, so make sure that we can see your face in the image!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;And the Small Print:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guys, we’re a startup, so money is tight. This means that we can’t fly anyone intercontinentally. We went round and round about a solution, but the budget simply isn’t there. Which is why we will be selecting &lt;strong&gt;one additional&lt;/strong&gt; intercontinental winner to receive a special gift from Chris Do himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local LA peeps are still eligible to win! If you are within driving distance of our office, there won’t be a flight (obviously), but we will still hang out with you all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, we are going to use the photo you submit for something special. Don’t worry, you won’t wind up on a billboard, but we definitely want to let you know that you will be a celebrated part of our content in the near future. If you submit your image, you are also granting The Futur LLC permission to use the image for promotional purposes. Mostly because we’re madly in love with all of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcf63d298d13eedaa83a_5e473e783b2e661836185341_image-profile-ben2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Burns is a designer that helps growing businesses increase revenue, expand brand awareness, and earn happier customers.

And in honor of this tremendous milestone, we want to give back to &lt;strong&gt;you.&lt;/strong&gt; So here it is: We will be flying &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; of you out to Santa Monica where you’re going to stay in a swag room, hang out with Chris Do and the rest of the Futur and Blind teams all day, go out to eat at our fav LA spots and get some epic one-on-one, up close and personal time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweet, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Here&amp;#39;s How to Enter:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting immediately, we will take submissions until we hit 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. This could be a day or it could be weeks. The moral of the story is: get your submission in ASAP. As soon as we hit 100K, we’ll pick one submission randomly. Here’s how you get your name in the hat, your hat the ring, and your player in the game:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Take a selfie wherever you are in the world – bonus points for creativity. Just make sure that we can see your face 🙂&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Post it to Instagram and tag @thefuturishere&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tell us why you want to fly out in the description. Hint: We are looking for enthusiasm.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure to include the hashtag #FlyMeToTheFutur&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If you’re not already subscribed on YouTube (shame!), do so.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t stress this enough: if you miss a step, your entry won’t be considered. We’re going to be pulling the submission by hashtag, so it’s IMPERATIVE that the hashtag is present. We’re also planning a bonus surprise for everyone who enters, so make sure that we can see your face in the image!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;And the Small Print:&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guys, we’re a startup, so money is tight. This means that we can’t fly anyone intercontinentally. We went round and round about a solution, but the budget simply isn’t there. Which is why we will be selecting &lt;strong&gt;one additional&lt;/strong&gt; intercontinental winner to receive a special gift from Chris Do himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local LA peeps are still eligible to win! If you are within driving distance of our office, there won’t be a flight (obviously), but we will still hang out with you all day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, we are going to use the photo you submit for something special. Don’t worry, you won’t wind up on a billboard, but we definitely want to let you know that you will be a celebrated part of our content in the near future. If you submit your image, you are also granting The Futur LLC permission to use the image for promotional purposes. Mostly because we’re madly in love with all of you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcf63d298d13eedaa83a_5e473e783b2e661836185341_image-profile-ben2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ben Burns is a designer that helps growing businesses increase revenue, expand brand awareness, and earn happier customers.

    <title>How to Be a Great Listener</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;How many times have you missed out on what someone was really saying because you were too busy thinking about how you were going to respond? How many times have you filled in a blank when someone paused, and had it be completely different than what they were going to say? How many times have you had to ask someone to repeat something because you weren’t fully engaged in what they were saying?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Listening isn’t an ability you’re born with. It’s something you can learn to do. As I’ve worked to be a better listener, I’ve found that improving myself in three areas has made a huge difference. By developing these traits, it’s become easier for me to really tune in to what the people around me are saying and fully understand what they’re trying to communicate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How to Be a Great Listener – The Three Traits&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Patience: If you’re that guy who’s always filling in the blanks for someone, it might be time to ask yourself how patient you really are. Filling in the pauses of a conversation is sometimes instinctual. It may feel like you’re doing it to show the other person that you’re engaged and listening. But for many of us, it has a lot less to do with being supportive and a lot more to do with hurrying the other person to the end of their sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active listening means cultivating the patience to put your desire to respond on the back burner. Practice patience to give the person you’re listening to the chance to fully express themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Confidence: How do you feel when you’re facilitating a conversation? Actively listening to a group of people can be intimidating. Instead of asking questions, sitting back, and absorbing the answers, you waste brain power by worrying about what you’re going to do next. Before you know it you’re asking people to repeat themselves and still not fully understanding what they’re saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether it’s facilitating a group or talking one on one with a potential new client, active listening requires confidence. It means turning off your own thoughts to leave space for what they’re saying. Practicing this in comfortable conversations can help you build up confidence in more intimidating conversations. As your confidence grows, so will your ability to listen in stressful situations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Presence: If you end a conversation with a clearer idea of what you’re going to eat for dinner than what the other person wants or needs, it’s time to work on being present. Being a great listener means being actively involved in the conversation. It means tuning out distractions (even closing your eyes if that helps) and being absolutely present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presence in a conversation may not come naturally. It’ll also feel really exhausting. If you do it right, you’ll leave the conversation feeling drained. But the effort you put into shutting out distractions and really focusing will pay off in a much deeper understanding of what that person is trying to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Patience, Confidence, And Presence&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incorporating these three traits into how you listen (and your life) will transform what you get out of every conversation. If your goal is to be a better listener, patience, confidence, and presence are where you need to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>Getting to the Heart of Your Lead’s Problem</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That can work out fine (sometimes) in the dating world, but it’s a really, really frustrating way to ask for a sale. Everyone you meet has a problem. Some of those problems you’re able to solve. By quickly and clearly communicating that fact, you can avoid wasting time and get to the ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;So… What&amp;#39;s Your Problem?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building a scaffolding to the ask by focusing on the problem isn’t always easy. If you enter a conversation with a referral, it’s a little tricky. If you’re going into a conversation cold, it can feel impossible. If you don’t build towards your ask in the right way, it’s awkward and abrasive for everyone involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focus on learning about the other person, not on proving yourself to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay. You’re at a networking mixer. A complete stranger comes up and shakes your hand. What do you do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you start rambling about who you are or what you do? No. That doesn’t reveal the problem. Instead, &lt;em&gt;ask questions&lt;/em&gt;. Get to know the person. Here are a few to get you started:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;What’s a day like in your life?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How long have you been in business?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What’s your area of expertise?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What kind of growth are you getting?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What kind of challenges are you facing right now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What do you need to get to the next level?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any specific question may or may not fit into the flow of the conversation. Don’t feel like you need to go through a checklist. Instead, focus on being genuinely interested in getting to know more about that person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let them do most of the talking. Make notes of what they’re saying. Where are they at now? What problems are they facing? Can you fix those problems? Focus on what’s wrong to build towards how you can make it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Next Step in Asking for the Sale&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;So the person you’re talking to has a problem. You think it’s something you can fix. How do you get from establishing a problem to asking for the sale? You guessed it – more questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point you want to gather a little more information while still getting to the ask quickly. Find out a little more about how they’re currently structured and if they may be receptive to working with you. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who’s doing your marketing right now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would you consider working with an outside vendor?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does the perfect marketing partner look like to you?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, finally:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d love to follow up with you and give you a short presentation of our capabilities if you think this is a relationship that might be of benefit to your company. Do you have a card so I can follow up?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;By establishing the problem and focusing on the potential client instead of yourself you build a scaffolding that naturally lifts you to asking for the sale. It doesn’t feel awkward. It doesn’t feel forced. It doesn’t seem to come out of nowhere. Instead, it highlights you as the solution to a problem the other person knows they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve established the problem, the other person will be looking for a solution. And if you’re that solution, it will be that much easier to get the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;Who’s doing your marketing right now?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would you consider working with an outside vendor?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What does the perfect marketing partner look like to you?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And, finally:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul role=&#34;list&#34;&gt;&lt;li&gt;I’d love to follow up with you and give you a short presentation of our capabilities if you think this is a relationship that might be of benefit to your company. Do you have a card so I can follow up?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;By establishing the problem and focusing on the potential client instead of yourself you build a scaffolding that naturally lifts you to asking for the sale. It doesn’t feel awkward. It doesn’t feel forced. It doesn’t seem to come out of nowhere. Instead, it highlights you as the solution to a problem the other person knows they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve established the problem, the other person will be looking for a solution. And if you’re that solution, it will be that much easier to get the sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/60c0fcdaf3709d3bf0a1f28c_5e473dc03f3602b7c4c3ad16_image-profile-chris2-440x440.jpg&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris Do is an Emmy award winning director, designer, strategist and educator.

    <title>How to Build Rapport</title>
    <updated>2017-02-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-02-27:/blog/how-to-build-rapport</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referrals are a beautiful thing. But let’s be honest – there are going to be times when you have to get out there and look for work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you hit the next networking event. People are everywhere. It&amp;#39;s chaotic to you. What do you do next? How do you build up to asking for a sale, when starting any kind of conversation feels really, really weird?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’ve found works for getting over that initial awkwardness and taking that first step towards a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Build rapport by practicing beforehand&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re not the only one who feels a little uncomfortable walking up and starting a conversation with a person at a party. Most designers tend to be introverted. I know I often feel a little uncomfortable talking to strangers. One thing I’ve done to try to get over that is practice on strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all meet random people throughout our day. We meet them on the street, in a restaurant, on a bus, in an elevator. And every time we do, we have a choice — do we ignore them, or do we take a moment to listen and learn more about who they are?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look at everyone I meet as a chance to learn. I ask them questions and listen to their responses. I’ve found the more I do this in my everyday life, the less awkward it feels when I meet someone I want to do business with. The more comfortable you feel getting to know someone when you’re not trying to close, the more natural it feels to connect in a business-centric environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Cultivate entry points&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re doing business with robots, everyone you could possibly build rapport with is going to have interests outside of their business. You need to develop those interests too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you skateboard. Maybe you love comic books. Maybe you go nuts over a cup of perfectly brewed tea. Maybe you drive a certain type of car or listen to a specific genre of music. These are all entry points that can get you started towards a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve met people with whom I went on to do business with in completely random situations. How’d we connect? Over a shared interest. I didn’t dive in by talking about myself or peppering them with questions about their business. We just talked about something we had in common and the conversation naturally grew to a place where I could ask for a sale. The more entry points you have, the more well-rounded you are as a person, the more likely you’ll be to have these kinds of conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your leads are going to come from the people around you. In order to get them, you have to put down your computer and go outside! That doesn’t necessarily mean diving head first into an intimidating or awkward event, but it does mean pushing yourself outside of what you’d normally find comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one more tip. Still not sure about getting out there?

    <title>How to Build Rapport</title>
    <updated>2017-02-27T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-02-27:/blog/how-to-build-rapport</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referrals are a beautiful thing. But let’s be honest – there are going to be times when you have to get out there and look for work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you hit the next networking event. People are everywhere. It&amp;#39;s chaotic to you. What do you do next? How do you build up to asking for a sale, when starting any kind of conversation feels really, really weird?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what I’ve found works for getting over that initial awkwardness and taking that first step towards a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Build rapport by practicing beforehand&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You’re not the only one who feels a little uncomfortable walking up and starting a conversation with a person at a party. Most designers tend to be introverted. I know I often feel a little uncomfortable talking to strangers. One thing I’ve done to try to get over that is practice on strangers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all meet random people throughout our day. We meet them on the street, in a restaurant, on a bus, in an elevator. And every time we do, we have a choice — do we ignore them, or do we take a moment to listen and learn more about who they are?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look at everyone I meet as a chance to learn. I ask them questions and listen to their responses. I’ve found the more I do this in my everyday life, the less awkward it feels when I meet someone I want to do business with. The more comfortable you feel getting to know someone when you’re not trying to close, the more natural it feels to connect in a business-centric environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Cultivate entry points&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re doing business with robots, everyone you could possibly build rapport with is going to have interests outside of their business. You need to develop those interests too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you skateboard. Maybe you love comic books. Maybe you go nuts over a cup of perfectly brewed tea. Maybe you drive a certain type of car or listen to a specific genre of music. These are all entry points that can get you started towards a sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve met people with whom I went on to do business with in completely random situations. How’d we connect? Over a shared interest. I didn’t dive in by talking about myself or peppering them with questions about their business. We just talked about something we had in common and the conversation naturally grew to a place where I could ask for a sale. The more entry points you have, the more well-rounded you are as a person, the more likely you’ll be to have these kinds of conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;The bottom line&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your leads are going to come from the people around you. In order to get them, you have to put down your computer and go outside! That doesn’t necessarily mean diving head first into an intimidating or awkward event, but it does mean pushing yourself outside of what you’d normally find comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh, and one more tip. Still not sure about getting out there? Read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/0671027034&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to Win Friends and Influence People&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Dale Carnegie.

    <title>Before You Design Anything</title>
    <updated>2017-02-14T00:00:00Z</updated>
    <id>tag:thefutur.com,2017-02-14:/blog/before-you-design-anything</id>
    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Every competitive pitch or design project begins with a kickoff meeting with your new client. &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your objective in this session: gather and distill information so you can synthesize an effective design solution. To accomplish this, you MUST do these three things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Define the goal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Diagnose the problem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Narrow your design exploration&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By doing these three things, your design process will be hyper-focused, and you won’t waste time chasing bad ideas. Let’s break each of those down one by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;1. Define the Goal&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one sentence, what is the project? What does it need to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting the goal out of the client is easy, but often the answer can be a bit lofty. Hear the client out. Help them prioritize what this piece should do. Then distill that into one sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you use more than one sentence to describe the goal of the project, the interpretation of it and proposed solutions will get watered down. Keep it simple and focused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT THIS SOUNDS LIKE:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This video will announce our new product x at ces”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This branded content video will educate consumers about wifi technology.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This teaser should build hype around the upcoming release of our new sneakers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you know what the client is trying to accomplish, what’s getting in the way of that? Let’s move onto the next critical thing you’ll need to do during the kickoff meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;2. Diagnose the Problem&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the challenge you need to address?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design is problem-solving. With every project, you’ll have a set of challenges you’ll need to surface and address for your client. &lt;em&gt;After all, that’s what they’re paying for. &lt;/em&gt;Here’s what you need to know to diagnose the problem you’re trying to solve: the who, how, and what.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;WHO IS THE TARGET AUDIENCE, AKA THE USER, AND WHY IS THIS IMPORTANT TO THEM? WHY DO THEY CARE?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;There can be more than one user, so try and identify the top three and prioritize the most important one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;WHAT DOES THIS PROJECT NEED TO COMMUNICATE? WHAT’S THE KEY TAKEAWAY MESSAGE? HOW SHOULD THE AUDIENCE FEEL AFTER?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they have too many things to say, prioritize the messaging and define the hierarchy with them. By doing that, you begin to show your value as a partner, using your design skills to provide clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;NOW THAT YOU HAVE A CLEAR MESSAGE, WHERE AND HOW WILL IT BE SHOWN? IN WHAT CONTEXT? WHAT PART OF THE SALES CYCLE IS THE USER?&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the context, a viewer will have a different state of mind and attention span. Is this a pre-roll ad on youtube? &lt;em&gt;Well then you need to hook them in 5 seconds, or they’ll skip this ad.&lt;/em&gt; Are they sitting in a convention hall or theater? &lt;em&gt;Well, then you can take your time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on what stage of the sales cycle the viewer is in, they’ll have different needs and intentions. If it’s early in the sales cycle, &lt;em&gt;they need to be made aware. &lt;/em&gt;If it’s late, &lt;em&gt;they’re ready to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you’ve identified what to say, who to say it to, and how you need to say it, you have identified the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For most of you, you probably feel like you’re ready to go off and make something, right? Well, it’s not time yet. Why? Because there are way too many possible design solutions to explore within a limited timeframe. So now comes our third step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;3. Narrow your Design Exploration&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Establish the criteria and define your sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design thinking and problem-solving take a lot of time and effort. If you narrow the possibilities of what’s valuable to explore before you design, you’ll save time and effort. You’ll stop broadly guessing what the client wants, and can focus on the solution they need. So how do you filter out possible solutions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;strong&gt;‍&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key questions you can ask your client:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the creative parameters to work within? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can it look like? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can it sound like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things will get tricky here and you have to look out for coded language; words like “epic, elegant, or energetic” are words that have a lot of room for subjective interpretation. Get specific with examples and break it down into simple language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/thefuturishere/how-to-achieve-design-clarity-listen-6ea11d584696#.zgp7qsydx&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;I go in depth in my Medium article, on how to translate coded language so you can walk away with clear, actionable guidelines.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Now you have the key ingredients you need to go off and synthesize an effective design solution. let’s recap those three things one more time.&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Define the goal — what is it? what does it need to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Diagnose the problem — what’s the challenge you need to solve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Narrow your design exploration — define what it can and can’t be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these three things established, you now have a clear, narrow target to hit when you begin designing. This is your north star, and your blueprint for you and your team to follow. The goal should drive everything you create and should be filtered by the criteria you’ve collectively organized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Want More?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xM-0aeHbk5Y?start=19&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/the-pitch-kit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384caadbcee1_1*WT2FRpEW-umxLXtw2Ua7NQ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have to pitch creative ideas to win business but are struggling to land these opportunities, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/the-pitch-kit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Pitch Kit&lt;/a&gt;.

Define the goal — what is it? what does it need to do?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Diagnose the problem — what’s the challenge you need to solve?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Narrow your design exploration — define what it can and can’t be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these three things established, you now have a clear, narrow target to hit when you begin designing. This is your north star, and your blueprint for you and your team to follow. The goal should drive everything you create and should be filtered by the criteria you’ve collectively organized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Want More?&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe allowfullscreen=&#34;true&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; scrolling=&#34;no&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xM-0aeHbk5Y?start=19&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/the-pitch-kit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://assets-global.website-files.com/5d816b07d269382588dbcab1/5d816b07d269384caadbcee1_1*WT2FRpEW-umxLXtw2Ua7NQ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who have to pitch creative ideas to win business but are struggling to land these opportunities, check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://academy.thefutur.com/p/the-pitch-kit&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Pitch Kit&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Three Questions to Ask Before Asking for the Sale</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;div id=&#34;readability-page-1&#34; class=&#34;page&#34;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you do it wrong (and it’s so easy to to do it wrong), it’s abrupt, awkward, and inauthentic. You end up alienating the person and you both walk away disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how do you ask for the sale? How do you get yourself in a position where what you&amp;#39;re asking doesn’t feel forced or completely out of nowhere? It starts with asking &lt;em&gt;yourself&lt;/em&gt; a few questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how I break it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The three things to ask before asking for the sale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I meet someone for the first time, my goal is to figure out what our relationship is going to be as quickly as possible. How do I frame our interactions? Is it going to be a student/mentor relationship? Who’s the student? Who’s the mentor? Is this a potential prospect for doing business? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the person you’re talking to seems like a great prospect, it’s time to figure out a few things about them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question number one: do i like this person?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re going to work with someone, you’re going to want to like them. Why bother building rapport with someone you can’t stand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So as you interact with someone, ask yourself: Am I getting good energy from you? Do you stand for things that I stand for? Are your stances opposed to mine? Are you self centered? Do I like being around you? Listen and learn throughout your conversation to decide if this is someone you really want to work with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question number two: do you have work that i can do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you’ve found someone you like. Great! The next step is determining if they have work you can do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the person you’re talking to needs help landscaping, that’s nice, but you’re probably not the person to help them. They may have work opportunities, but they’re not for you. It’s up to you to decide how much time you want to put into talking with someone who just doesn’t need what you can provide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question number three: can you afford me?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before you can continue your dialogue with a potential prospect, you have to know if a sale is actually feasible. I meet with a lot of people who want to hire us, but the budget just isn’t there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research as much about the person as you can before you meet with them. It will help you determine if they can afford you. Check out their LinkedIn profile. See what they’re working on, or who they’re working for. Is their business the kind that can afford you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still not sure? Ask. It&amp;#39;s as simple as that. Ask, “Do you have a budget? Do you mind sharing it with us?” Or ask, “What have you spent in the past?” If they don’t want to give you a straight answer, try saying something like, &amp;#34;Give me an average – I won’t hold you to it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‍&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know who you’re talking to before asking for the sale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;The more you know about the person you’re meeting with, the easier it will feel to ask for the sale. These three questions will help you figure out if this is someone you want to work with. The answers will help you build the rapport that will make the ask go more smoothly.
